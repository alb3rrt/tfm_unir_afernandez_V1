(Dated: June 3, 2021) We extend the kinetic theory of D mesons to accommodate thermal and offshell effects due to the medium modification of the heavy-meson spectral functions. From the Kadanoff-Baym approach we derive the off-shell Fokker-Planck equation which encodes the heavy-flavor transport coefficients. We analyze the thermal width (damping rate) of D mesons due to their scattering off light mesons, focusing on new in-medium effects: off-shell corrections, inelastic channels, and the contribution of the Landau cut. We obtain that the latter effect (absent for vacuum scattering amplitudes) brings sizable corrections at moderate temperatures. We discuss how the heavy-flavor transport coefficients, like the drag and diffusion coefficients, are modified in matter. We find that the D-meson spatial diffusion coefficient matches smoothly to the latest results of lattice-QCD calculations and Bayesian analyses at higher temperatures.

I. INTRODUCTION
Heavy hadrons are considered to be an efficient and unique probe for testing the different quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phases created in heavy-ion collisions (HiCs), in both quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and hadronic phases (see Refs. [1­5] for recent reviews). Due to the large mass of the heavy (charm and bottom) quarks as compared to the mass of the light-flavor quarks, heavy quarks have large relaxation times and, thus, cannot totally relax to equilibrium during the fireball expansion in HiCs. For this reason, heavy mesons constitute ideal probes to characterize the QGP properties and determining their in-medium properties in a hadronic medium at extreme conditions is a subject that attracts a lot of interest nowadays.
The characterization of the different QCD phases can be performed by analyzing experimental observables in HiCs, such as the nuclear modification ratio as well as the elliptic flow [1­5]. These physical observables are strongly correlated to the behaviour of the transport properties of heavy hadrons, and these depend crucially on the interaction of the heavy particles with the surrounding medium.
In particular, the diffusion of open-charm (D mesons) in hadronic matter was initially obtained within an effective theory that incorporated both chiral and heavy-quark symmetries [6], and also using parametrized interactions with light mesons and baryons [7]. Moreover, the scattering amplitudes of D mesons with light mesons and baryons were obtained by means of effective Lagrangians at leading order [8]. However, the need of unitarization was later pointed out so as to avoid unphysically large transport coefficients [9].
Following these initial works, we exploited chiral and heavy-quark symmetries to obtain the unitarized effective interaction of heavy mesons, such as D [10, 11] and also B¯ [12, 13], with light mesons and baryons. With these interactions, we obtained the heavy-meson transport coefficients as a function of temperature and baryochemical potential of the hadronic bath by means of the Fokker-Planck equation approach [10, 11, 14]. Moreover, we examined the transport coefficients of the low-lying heavy baryons (c and b) using a similar unitarized framework to account for the interaction of these states with light mesons [15, 16].
Similar approaches using different models or effective descriptions, both below and above the phase transition, have been developed (see [7, 8, 14, 17­29] for some references). These works exploited the Fokker-Planck (or Langevin) equation description for the heavy parti-

3
cles. Some studies pointed out limitations in the QGP phase and considered the Boltzmann equation instead [15, 30]. While Fokker-Planck or Boltzmann kinetic equations seem natural starting points to address transport coefficients, the scattering amplitudes used to describe collisions (computed from a microscopic model) were completely independent of the kinetic theory. Therefore, from a purely theoretical perspective, there is a lack of internal consistency in these calculations, as it would be desirable to construct both the interaction rates and the transport equation from the same microscopic theory.
On the other hand, in most of the previous analyses the transition amplitudes of heavy mesons with light hadrons and, hence, the transport coefficients were calculated without implementing medium corrections for the interactions. Indeed, off-shell effects cannot be accounted for in the standard Boltzmann or Fokker-Planck equations. For that, an extension using the more general Kadanoff-Baym equations is required. Secondly, in-medium interactions induce new kinematic domains which affect the D-meson properties. These new effects--which would also affect D-meson transport coefficients--can be naturally incorporated upon the derivation of an off-shell kinetic equation. Therefore, to apply our findings of Refs. [31, 32] we are forced to address the derivation of an off-shell kinetic equation and, with this, to consistently describe interaction rates and the transport equation from the same effective theory.
In this paper we focus on D mesons and analyze the effect on the transport properties of the scattering of these heavy mesons with a mesonic bath at finite temperature. To this end we make use of the in-medium unitarized amplitudes in a mesonic environment at finite temperature recently developed in Refs. [31, 32], that have been tested against lattice QCD calculations below the temperature of the QCD phase transition [33]. The final goal is to calculate the D-meson transport coefficients below the transition temperature, paying a special attention to the inclusion of off-shell effects coming from the full spectral features of the D meson in a hot mesonic bath. We will compare our results with the latest results of lattice-QCD [34­38] and Bayesian analyses [39] performed for temperatures close and above Tc.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present the derivation of the Boltzmann equation implementing the full features of the T -matrix approach, whereas in Sec. III we show the different kinematic contributions to the D-meson thermal width coming from the off-shell treatment of the D meson. In Sec. IV we obtain the different transport coefficients

4
within the off-shell approach after re-deriving the Fokker-Planck equation. Our results are given in Sec. V, while we conclude in Sec. VI. We also include two appendices, where we present details on the Wigner transform of the 2-point functions (Appendix A) and the derivation of the on-shell Fokker-Planck equation (Appendix B), which matches previous approaches.
II. OFF-SHELL KINETIC EQUATION AND T -MATRIX APPROXIMATION
In this section we review the theoretical part of our study, namely the derivation of a kinetic equation for D mesons interacting with light mesons. This derivation exploits the real-time formalism of scalar quantum fields, which is a standard technique [40­49]. Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, we will detail some of the main steps, paying special attention to the connection with the T -matrix approximation of the collision term [40, 41, 43].
While the derivation of the kinetic theory based on out-of-equilibrium quantum field theory is rather general, for the practical computation of the physical quantities considered in this work (thermal widths and transport coefficients), only equilibrium properties, mostly taken from our previous Refs. [31, 32], will be used.
We work in the real-time formalism with meson fields defined along a contour on the complex time plane [40, 45, 46, 48]. The so-called Kadanoff-Baym contour--shown in the left panel of Figure 1--starts at an initial time x0i , runs along the real axis until the final time x0f and comes back again until x0i . Finally it makes a vertical descend until x0i - i, where  = 1/T . This vertical path alone, the Matsubara contour C, is the basis of the imaginary time formalism (with x0i = 0), which we exploit to compute equilibrium properties. By setting x0i  - and x0f  + one ends up with the so-called Schwinger-Keldysh contour C, in the right panel of Fig. 1. We will work with this contour and define our Green's functions along C, which in turn is composed of forward C1 and backward C2 branches (these are infinitely close to the real axis, but plotted at a certain distance for illustration).

FIG. 1. Left: Kadanoff-Baym contour on the complex time plane, composed of a forward branch (C1), backward branch (C2), and the Matsubara contour C. Right: Schwinger-Keldysh contour C = C1  C2, where the forward and backward branches are extended until (-, +).

The time-ordered (along the C contour) D-meson propagator is defined as 1



 D(x)D(y) if x0 y0

iGD(x, y) = TCD(x)D(y) =

,

(1)

 D(y)D(x) if y0 x0

where the subscript in G(x, y) refers to the particular hadron species. The contour ordering operator TC orders field operators along the temporal contour C. In this context, the notation x0 y0 represents that time x0 comes later (along C) than y0.
In the practice we work with the so-called "greater" and "lesser" Green's functions (also called Wightman functions),

iG>D(x, y)  D(x)D(y) ,

(2)

iG<D(x, y)  D(y)D(x) .

(3)

Such definitions for the D meson can be extended to the light-meson sector, e.g. for the meson Wightman functions iG(x, y), where  = {, K, K¯ , }. The physical interpretation of the Wightman functions in Eqs. (2) and (3) can be found in the classical Ref. [40].
It is also convenient to introduce the retarded and advanced D-meson propagators, which are related to Eqs. (2) and (3) as

GRD(x, y) = C(x0 - y0)[G>D(x, y) - G<D(x, y)] ,

(4)

GAD(x, y) = -C(y0 - x0)[G>D(x, y) - G<D(x, y)] ,

(5)

1 We suppress isospin indices of the Green's function to ease notation. We will eventually describe the effect of the isospin degree of freedom when discussing the allowed interaction channels in the problem.

6

where the generalized step function C(x0 - y0) is defined along the Schwinger-Keldysh contour, and it is 0 if x0  y0, and 1 if x0 y0.
In coordinate space, the D-meson self-energy is also defined along the real-time contour C. The time-ordered D-meson self-energy [45] reads

D(x, y) = D(x)(3)(x - y)C(x0 - y0) + C(x0 - y0)>D(x, y) + C(y0 - x0)<D(x, y) , (6)

where (x) is the local (tadpole) contribution [45]. We have introduced a generalized Dirac delta C(x0 - y0) along the contour which can be defined as



 

(x0 - y0)

if

x0, y0  C1 ,





C(x0 - y0) = -(x0 - y0)

if

x0, y0  C2 ,

(7)



  

0

otherwise.

Definitions for <D(x, y) and >D(x, y) are analogous to those of the Green's function. Similarly, the retarded and advanced self-energies follow

RD(x, y) = C(x0 - y0)[>D(x, y) - <D(x, y)] ,

(8)

AD(x, y) = -C(y0 - x0)[>D(x, y) - <D(x, y)] .

(9)

We mention that the equilibrium retarded D-meson self-energy can be computed along the Matsubara contour, as was done in our previous papers [31, 32] using the imaginary-time formalism. In this work we will extensively use those results. To simplify the notation, from now on we suppress the subindex in the self-energies as it is understood that all of them refer to the D meson.
The Dyson equations for the time-ordered Green's function read [40, 41, 43­45],

-[x2 + m2D,0] GD(x, y) - d4z (x, z)GD(z, y) = C(x0 - y0)(3)(x - y) , (10)
C
-[y2 + m2D,0] GD(x, y) - d4z GD(x, z)(z, y) = C(x0 - y0)(3)(x - y) , (11)
C
where the time convolution ( C dz0) is taken along the Schwinger-Keldysh path. The bare D-meson mass term is denoted as mD,0. Equations (10) and (11) are independent Dyson
equations, acting on the two possible arguments of the Green's function. While in the
absence of interactions the equations of motion are the Klein-Gordon ones, when interactions
are considered the D-meson self-energy corrections need to be taken into account. The

7

microscopic theory to describe interactions is the effective theory used in Refs. [31, 32], which incorporates chiral and heavy-quark spin symmetries.
One can particularize Eqs. (10) and (11) for the "lesser" function G<D(x, y), for example by fixing x0 in the forward contour C1 and y0 in the backward one C2. One finds

-[x2 + m2D,0] G<D(x, y) - d4z(x, z)GD(z, y) = 0 ,

(12)

C

-[y2 + m2D,0] G<D(x, y) - d4zGD(x, z)(z, y) = 0 ,

(13)

C

where the convolution operation should respect x0  y0. This term can be simplified by applying the Langreth rules [46] to arrive to



-[x2 + m2D,0 + (x)] G<D(x, y) =

d4z R(x, z)G<D(z, y) + <(x, z)GAD(z, y) , (14)

-



-[y2 + m2D,0 + (y)] G<D(x, y) =

d4z G<D(x, z)A(z, y) + GRD(x, z)<(z, y) , (15)

-

where we have introduced the decomposition of the self-energy given in Eq. (6). Notice that the time integration in z0 is now restricted from - to + only (i.e. along C1 in Fig. 1). Equations for G>D(x, y) can be obtained by formally replacing "<" by ">" in all cases. To lighten the notation we write both equations as

[G-0,x1 - (x)] GD(x, y) = (R  GD)(x, y) + (  GAD)(x, y) ,

(16)

[G-0,y1 - (y)] GD(x, y) = (GD  A)(x, y) + (GRD  )(x, y) ,

(17)

where we have defined G-0,x1  -x2 - m2D,0 and introduced the convolution symbol as



(R  GD)(x, y) 

d4z R(x, z)GD(z, y) .

(18)

-

For completeness, the equations of motion for the retarded/advanced Green's functions

are,

[G-0,x1 - (x)] GRD/A(x, y) - (R/A  GRD/A)(x, y) = (4)(x - y) ,

(19)

[G-0,y1 - (y)] GRD/A(x, y) - (GRD/A  R/A)(x, y) = (4)(x - y) ,

(20)

where the Dirac deltas are the standard ones (4)(x - y) = (x0 - y0)(3)(x - y). These equations can be obtained using the definitions in Eqs. (8) and (9). We note that equations (16),(17),(19) and (20) are known as Kadanoff-Baym equations [40].

8

To construct a kinetic equation from the Kadanoff-Baym equations we start by taking the difference between Eqs. (16) and (17) for G<D(x, y),

[G-0,x1 - (x)]G<D(x, y) - [G-0,y1 - (y)] G<D(x, y)

= (R  G<D + <  GAD - G<D  A - GRD  <)(x, y) .

(21)

In order to facilitate subsequent computations, it is convenient to combine the convolution operator with the (anti-)commutator by introducing the following notation (suppressing the space-time indices temporarily to lighten the expressions)

[A , B]  A  B - B  A ,

(22)

{A , B}  A  B + B  A .

(23)

Using these operators one can write Eq. (21) as

(24)

This equation can be simplified with the help of Eqs. (4) and (5), as well as Eqs. (8) and (9), which imply

GRD(x, y) - GAD(x, y) = G>D(x, y) - G<D(x, y) ,

(25)

R(x, y) - A(x, y) = >(x, y) - <(x, y) .

(26)

Then, the equation for G<D(x, y) reads [41, 44, 45]

Equations (27) and (28) are still rather general kinetic equations for which one needs to detail the form of the D-meson self-energy in terms of the Green's functions in order to have

9

a close form. Before doing that, one can implement a Wigner transformation, together with a gradient expansion to simplify them [40].
For this we assume that the Green's function depends differently on the center-of-mass coordinate X = (x + y)/2 and the relative coordinate s = x - y . When the dependence on X is much smoother than the one in s, it makes sense to Fourier transform the later and apply a gradient expansion for the former. In that respect we expand in powers of Xµ , and perform the so-called Wigner transform to the two-point functions. For a generic operator A(x, y), the Wigner transform is defined as,

A(x, y) -W-T A(X, k) =

(29)

In Appendix A we provide some details on how to compute the Wigner transform of the product and convolution of operators [46]. All those rules should be applied for the Wigner transform of Eqs. (27) and (28).
After Wigner transform, Eq. (27) reads

where all (unwritten) arguments are now phase-space variables (X, k). To obtain this equation, apart from using the results in Appendix A, we have applied

which follows from

(32)

R(X, k) = [A(X, k)] .

(33)

The relations in Eqs. (25) and (26) remain after the Wigner transform,

GRD(X, k) - GAD(X, k) = G>D(X, k) - G<D(X, k) = 2iIm GRD(X, k) ,

(34)

R(X, k) - A(X, k) = >(X, k) - <(X, k) = 2iIm R(X, k) .

where we have incorporated the local tadpole term (X) into the real part of the retarded self-energy Re R(X, k), following the T -matrix approximation [31].
For the purpose of this work--where we will eventually consider an equilibrium situation in a homogeneous background--we will neglect the mean-field term in Eq. (36), proportional to X,µRe R [50]. In addition, we will not consider the Poisson bracket of the same equation. This term was shown to be unimportant in the quasiparticle limit and can be safely neglected [41, 48, 50]. However, one should not forget that in the off-shell case it contributes to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of G>D(X, k) [43, 50] (see also [48] and references therein).
With these approximations we arrive to the final form of the "off-shell" transport equation,

(38)

Related to the dispersion relation of the D-meson one can consider the equations for the

retarded Green's function GRD in Eqs. (19) and (20). If we consider their sum and perform the Wigner transformation along with the gradient expansion we arrive to

[k2 - m2D,0 - R(X, k)]GRD(X, k) = 1 ,

(39)

where we have neglected operators O(X2 ), and again, incorporated the local (X) into the retarded self-energy, as for the T -matrix approximation. The pole of the retarded Green's function, that is the zero of the left-hand-side, will generically provide the dispersion relation of the D meson modified by the interactions. Notice that the equilibrium and homogeneous R(k) was studied in Ref. [31] and it will be exploited here as well.

11
To have a closed equation for G<D(X, k) the remaining step is to detail the D-meson selfenergies in terms of the Green's functions. For that goal one needs to apply the microscopical theory for the given system. In our case, we employ the effective approach of [31, 32] (see also references therein), which uses chiral and heavy-quark spin symmetries, as well as exact unitarity constraints for the scattering matrix. The later are implemented via an in-medium T -matrix resummation of the scattering amplitudes. Such method can be extended to nonequilibrium [40, 41, 43], where the D-meson self-energies can be written in terms of the (retarded) T -matrix element as [40],

Diagrammatically, the self-energies (X, k) are given by the 2-loop diagram represented in Fig. 2. The solid lines represent heavy mesons, while dashed lines are  propagators, and the vertices stand for the full T matrices.

The sum over a, b, c in Eqs. (40) and (41) encodes the different species that can interact

12

and that are fixed by the effective vertices. This sum is restricted to particular combinations (respecting conservation of quantum numbers) which are described in detail in [32], where a full coupled-channel analysis was performed. In particular, Da can describe either D or Ds mesons, and b, c can represent , K, K¯ , . Notice that the T matrix appearing in Eq. (40) and Eq. (41) is a retarded amplitude and follows from a Bethe-Salpeter equation, as extensively described in Refs. [31, 32].
To be more specific, we explicitly show the different intermediate channels contributing to the self-energies in Fig. 3. There is a total of 10 different diagrams. Not all of them are equally important. We will comment on that when addressing the effect of inelastic processes in our calculations.

We now discuss the form of the Wightman functions GD,(X, k). We have mentioned that light degrees of freedom satisfy their own Kadanoff-Baym equations, which are coupled to those of the heavy mesons. In the context of heavy-ion collisions, the standard approach for heavy-flavor dynamics is to exploit the fact that the light degrees of freedom have reached equilibrium much before than the heavy sector, as the latter has a much longer relaxation time (roughly proportional to the mass of the particle). In our goal of accessing transport coefficients of heavy mesons, we will also assume this, so there is no need to consider the kinetic equation for light mesons.

13
In addition, we apply the thermal local equilibrium solution for G(X, k), which can be expressed as [40]

iG<(X, k) = 2S(X, k)f(0)(X, k0) ,

(42)

iG>(X, k) = 2S(X, k) [1 + f(0)(X, k0)] ,

(43)

where S(X, k) is the equilibrium light-meson spectral function and f (0)(X, k0) is the equilibrium occupation number, i.e. the Bose-Einstein distribution function. Equation (43) incorporates the Bose enhancement factor 1 + f (0)(X, k0).
Concerning the D mesons, we will assume that they are not far from equilibrium (which is enough to address the calculation of the transport coefficients) and use a similar form as in Eqs. (42) and (43) for the Green's function, the so-called Kadanoff-Baym ansatz,

iG<D(X, k) = 2SD(X, k)fD(X, k0) ,

(44)

iG>D(X, k) = 2SD(X, k) [1 + fD(X, k0)] ,

(45)

where the D-meson spectral function SD(X, k) and the distribution function fD(X, k0) are out of equilibrium.
Inserting these ansa¨tze into the kinetic equation (see Eq. (37)), together with the D-meson self-energies defined in Eqs. (40) and (41), one obtains

where the transport equation for the spectral function has been used after Eq. (46)2.

This equation is very similar to the standard Boltzmann equation but the effects of

the medium (temperature and density) are now incorporated in the T -matrix and in the spectral functions of the interacting particles. The reduction of this equation to the classical

Boltzmann equation makes extra an assumption for the spectral functions, the quasiparticle approximation. We will comment on this approximation in the next section in the particular

context of D mesons.

A. Boltzmann equation for heavy mesons

Let us now consider a situation close to equilibrium in which the inhomogeneities of the

spectral functions can be ignored as a first approximation. These equilibrium quantities can

be computed using the imaginary-time formalism, as it was done in [32]. We summarize

here some key results. The D-meson retarded propagator reads

GRD(k0, k)

=

(k0)2

- k2 - m2D

- Re

1 R(k0, k; T ) - iIm

R(k0, k; T )

,

(48)

where mD is the (vacuum) physical D-meson mass, renormalized by the vacuum contribution

of the retarded D-meson self-energy R. Please notice that after mass renormalization, the

real and imaginary parts of the self-energy in Eq. (48) only contain thermal corrections.

This form can also be obtained from Eq. (39) when applied to the equilibrium case.

2 Note that from Eqs. (44) and (45) one has SD(X, k) = i[G>D(X, k) - G<D(X, k)]/(2). Then, subtracting the transport equations, Eq. (38) minus Eq. (37), one obtains that the transport equation for the spectral

density reads

The spectral function can be obtained from the imaginary part of the retarded propagator

as

(49)

where we have used Eq. (34). This definition of the spectral function in terms of the imagi-

nary part of the retarded Green's function is compatible with the conventions of Refs. [31, 32]

for the equilibrium case.

In terms of the D-meson retarded self-energy, the spectral function reads

(50)

In the quasiparticle approximation the pole of the retarded Green's function is not far

from the vacuum one and the spectral function can be written as

SD(k0, k)

zk

k

,

(51)

where Ek is the quasiparticle energy, solution of

(52)

and the damping rate k is defined as

(53)

with the zk factor,

.
k0=Ek

(54)

In the next section we will address how accurate this quasiparticle limit is for the D-meson

spectral function. In particular, this entails that the D-meson damping rate should be much

smaller than the quasiparticle energy Ek at all temperatures. In the limit k/Ek  0 one

can take the narrow limit,

SD(k)



zk 2Ek

[(k0

-

Ek)

-

(k0

.

(55)

In this limit one is effectively treating the quasiparticle as a stable state (no thermal width), but with a medium-modified energy Ek plus a correction due to the zk factor.
The narrow limit allows to trivially perform the integration over ki0 variables in the kinetic equation in Eq. (47) to obtain the on-shell (or Boltzmann) transport equation. When

16
assuming this approximation for all the particles involved, different combinations of the Dirac delta functions can be taken, which describe different scattering processes [45, 50]. However in this limit, the energy-momentum conservation only allows 2  2 processes [47, 50]. Among those, the one with a DD¯ pair in the initial state can be neglected due to the Boltzmann suppression factor (and the inverse reaction is suppressed due to the high energy threshold for the two incoming pions). Therefore one only considers one type of collisions (D  D). We label the momenta of a generic scattering as k + 3  1 + 2, see Fig. 4 for illustration.

Denoting for simplicity fi  fD,(X, Ei) (where the species is fixed by the value of i, i.e. i = {1, k} for the heavy meson, i = {2, 3} for the light meson), we obtain

(56)

where the two different collision terms depend on the sign of the energy of the light meson E3. The first one evaluates the scattering amplitude above the mass threshold of particles k and 3 and we will refer to it as unitary contribution. The second one implies the scattering amplitude below the energy threshold and it is non-zero due to the so-called Landau cut [8, 51] of the 2-particle propagator. This term will be referred to as Landau contribution, and it will be of key importance in this work.

17

If only elastic collisions are considered, then one can simplify the equation by changing

variables k2 and k3 to obtain,

k t - Ek · X

fk

. (57)

This equation looks almost as the Boltzmann equation3 considered in previous works, where the effect of the Landau contribution was neglected, vacuum scattering amplitudes were employed, and the factors zi were set to one. A version of the transport equation where these factors were kept, is presented in Ref. [44]. In our particular case, the approximation zi 1 is an excellent one, given the good quasiparticle description of the D mesons. Notice that the quasiparticle energies in Eq. (57) and the T matrix do contain medium modifications.

B. Validity of quasiparticle approximation
We have made quite a long introduction to derive the kinetic equation satisfied by D mesons, and commented the different approximations which can be used to simplify it, from the Kadanoff-Baym equation to the classical Boltzmann equation. These steps were necessary to justify the form of the kinetic equation constructed from the effective theory in [31], which was never addressed in detail before. In addition, this derivation will also help to perform the off-shell generalization of the Fokker-Planck equation and the heavy-flavor transport coefficients, which will be pursued in Section IV A.
We conclude this section, by discussing how reliable is the quasiparticle approximation using improved results with respect to those in Ref. [32]4. Firstly, we extract the quasiparticle energies Ek for three different temperatures T = 40, 100, 150 MeV, spanning the range considered in [32]. The quasiparticle energies are computed using Eq. (52), and they are given in the left panel of Fig. 5 as a function of the D-meson momentum. The value of Ek at k = 0 is interpreted as the D-meson thermal mass, and it decreases with temperature. Indeed, we have checked that Ek=0 coincide almost perfectly with the values obtained by looking at the peak of the spectral function calculated from Eq. (50). This agreement is
3 More exactly, the Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation, as quantum effects are incorporated. 4 The differences essentially consist in an increase of the values of the cutoffs in the integrals of the imaginary
time formalism.

18

already an indication of the good quasiparticle approximation. Notice that, as done in our previous calculation [32], Fig. 5 only contains the pion contribution to the D-meson self-energy.

FIG. 5. Left panel: D-meson quasiparticle energy in a thermal pion gas. Right panel: Thermal width (or twice the damping rate) of D-mesons in a thermal pion gas.

We have numerically checked that the zk-factors are very close to one. Rather independent of the quasiparticle momentum k, we observe up to 2 % (1 %) deviations from unity for T = 150 MeV (T = 100 MeV). For T = 40 MeV, the factor z is fully compatible with one. Therefore the approximation zi 1 is an excellent one, and will be used in what follows.
Also interesting is the damping rate k computed from the imaginary part of the D-meson self-energy. Instead of this parameter, we show in the right panel of Fig. 5 the D-meson thermal width k, defined as twice the damping rate, k  2k. This quantity is negligible at low temperatures, but the effects of the medium makes it sizable at T = 150 MeV, with thermal widths of the order of 70 MeV. Nevertheless, these values are still small (30 times smaller) compared to the corresponding Ek. This validates the quasiparticle approach.
In the next sections we will explore different approximations to address the D-meson thermal width and the transport coefficients. From the results of this section, where the quasiparticle approximation applies very well to the D meson, we can anticipate that offshell effects might not contribute much to these quantities. Nevertheless, we will stay as general as possible and quantify the importance of the different approximations.

19
III. KINEMATIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO D-MESON THERMAL WIDTH
In this section we analyze in great detail several effects on the D-meson thermal width k, defined as twice the damping rate of Eq. (53). This coefficient is given for an on-shell D meson, meaning that the D-meson energy Ek is automatically fixed by k through Eq. (52). However, the internal propagators of the retarded self-energy do not need to be on their mass shell. These off-shell effects will be addressed here, together with the importance of the Landau cut and the contribution of the inelastic channels.

A. Thermal width from the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude

In the right panel of Fig. 5 we have already shown the D-meson thermal width, given by

k

,

(58)

obtained from the retarded self-energy calculation of Ref. [32]. In that work only the effect

of pions was considered in the self-consistent calculation of the D-meson self-energy, being

the contribution of the other light mesons very suppressed. Here we will also analyze these

contributions as we have access to all the elements of the T matrix.

Let us review the calculation of k in more detail and study the contributions from the different kinematic ranges. Following the method used in Refs. [31, 32], the calculation of

Eq. (58) in terms of T -matrix elements is performed in the imaginary time formalism via a

one-loop diagram involving the T -matrix,

(in, k) = -T

d3p (2)3

G(im, p) TD(im + in, p + k) ,

(59)

im

where in is the external Matsubara frequency and im is the internal one, which is summed

over.

In accordance to the approximation made in Ref. [32], in this work we also use the free

pion propagator,

(in, k) = -T

d3p (2)3

TD(im + in, p + k)

summing over Matsubara frequencies via complex integration, by deforming the domain to encircle the three simple poles, and finally performing the analytic continuation (in  k0 + i ), we obtain the imaginary part of the retarded self-energy,

where we have already fixed the external D-meson energy to the quasiparticle energy Ek, that is function of k, cf. Eq. (52). We have neglected the zk factors, because they are very close to one, as previously discussed (but they can be easily incorporated, if desired).

Using the result in Eq. (62), we can write the D-meson thermal width in Eq. (58) as the

contribution of four pieces,

k = (k1) + (k2) + (k3) + (k4) ,

(63)

where

(67)

It is important to realize that both (k1) and (k3) receive a contribution from the scattering amplitude above the two-particle mass threshold; while (k2) and (k4) depend on the values of the T -matrix below threshold. The latter contribution is related to the Landau cut, and only appears at finite temperature when the total momentum of the collision if different from zero or when the masses of the interacting particles are different [51­53].
In particular, when vacuum amplitudes are used, the Landau cut disappears, and only (k1) and (k3) contribute. Incidentally, this is the situation in the pion-pion vacuum scattering

21

of Ref. [54], where only (k1) appears. In our case, (k3) is in fact extremely small, because it is roughly proportional to the product of the pion and D-meson densities, and the latter are very scarce 5. However, when considering a medium-dependent interaction, (k2) and (k4) will also have a potential important contribution that we now quantify.

FIG. 6. The D-meson thermal width as computed from Eq. (63). In dashed lines we show the contribution of (1) +(3) (Eqs. (64)+(66) above the threshold), whereas in dotted lines, we display the contribution of (2) + (4) [Eqs. (65)+(67) below the threshold (Landau cut)].
To gauge the weight of the different terms in Eq. (63) we plot in Fig. 6 the different contributions at three different temperatures. The input for TD is taken from updated

22
results of the scattering amplitudes obtained in Ref. [32]. At small temperatures (T = 40 MeV) the terms (k1) + (k3) dominate. Nevertheless, the
two pieces coming from the Landau cut (k2) + (k4) give a nonzero contribution resulting in a 20% of the total thermal width. At T = 100 MeV, the contribution of the unitarity cut ((k1)+(k3)) and the Landau cut ((k2)+(k4)) are similar. For the higher temperatures T = 150 MeV the contribution from the Landau cut already surpasses that of the unitary cut. This means that for temperatures close to Tc there is a dominant contribution to the thermal width coming from the Landau cut, which would be overlooked if vacuum amplitudes were used. We have also checked that (k3) is negligible for all momenta and temperatures.
Note that we have applied a cutoff of 2000 MeV for the total momentum |p + k|, to avoid using the results of the effective theory at values where the theory is not valid anymore. The systematic truncation error for not extending the integration until infinity is around 5 %, estimated by increasing this cutoff until convergence in achieved. However, we keep this cutoff in our calculations, as otherwise the error introduced by using scattering amplitudes outside the validity region of the EFT is not easily quantifiable.

B. Thermal width from the scattering amplitude squared

The calculation of the thermal width due to thermal pions using Eqs. (63) to (67) allowed us to distinguish the relative weight of the unitary and Landau contributions. However, the effect of the individual collision terms (D  D, D  D, D  DsK¯ ) cannot be disentangled. On the other hand, the computation of heavy-flavor transport coefficients is performed from the kinetic transport equation, where the collision rates, that are proportional to |TD|2, are used. For these reasons, we will derive an alternative expression for k, in terms of the scattering amplitude squared, which will also serve to double check our previous determination of k.
We start from the same definition of the thermal width of Eq. (58) and use Eq. (35) applied to an on-shell D meson

Im

R(Ek, k) =

1 2i

(>(Ek,

k)

-

<(Ek,

.

(68)

In equilibrium, we can exploit the so-called Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation for the "lesser"

23

and "greater" self-energies [40, 45],

<(Ek, k) = e-Ek >(Ek, k) ,

(69)

obtaining,

(70)

where we have denoted f~k(0)  f~(0)(Ek), and already simplified zk 1.

We can now insert the expression in Eq. (41) for >(Ek, k), which provides an interpreta-

tion of the thermal width in terms of particle collisions. As in the derivation of the off-shell

transport theory we replace the light-meson propagators by those for free particles, but keep

the full spectral function of the internal D meson. We can write the thermal width as

k = (kU) + (kL) ,

where, like in the expression in Eq. (41), there is an implicit restricted summation over particle species, according to the allowed scattering channels. In particular, if one focuses on the pion contribution to the D-meson thermal width--hence particle 3 being a --then the remaining sum over species 1 and 2 contains three possibilities: D  D, D  D and D  DsK¯ scatterings.
The separation made in Eq. (71) makes it clear that k(U) evaluates the scattering amplitude above threshold, and it is related to the unitary cut of the scattering amplitude, while (kL) evaluates it below threshold and is therefore related to the Landau cut.
Before showing results, let us mention that, as in the on-shell reduction of the transport theory, if the internal D meson is approximated by a narrow quasiparticle, only the positive branch of the spectral function SD(k10, k1) and  = +1 can hold the energy conservation in

24

Eq. (72). The same is true for Eq. (73) but with  = -1. Therefore in the on-shell case

(o.s.), the expressions in Eqs. (72) and (73) reduce to

(77)

Equations (76) and (77) can be potentially useful when the D meson is treated as a
narrow quasiparticle and inelastic collisions are neglected. Unless otherwise stated, we do
not assume this.
Coming back to the general result of Eqs. (72) and (73), where the full spectral function of the internal D meson is kept, it is possible to analytically check that (kU) in Eq. (72) is equal to the combination (k1) + (k3) in Eqs. (64) and (66), while (kL) in Eq. (73) exactly coincides with (k2) + (k4) in Eqs. (65) and (67). To do that, one needs to apply the unitarity condition (or optical theorem in the coupled-channel case)

26
We present the results of Eqs. (72) and (73) for temperatures T = 40, 100, 150 MeV in Fig. 7. We separate the contributions of the unitary and Landau cuts for each temperature, and obtain a similar result to that in Fig. 6 (where the integration over Im TDD was employed). For consistency with the coupled-channel optical theorem, we have included the three channels D  D, D  D and D  DsK¯ .
C. Quantification of different effects
The differences between the two approaches, as well as the analysis of several other effects are summarized in the following.
1. Effect of truncation
As stated, one can analytically prove that the two alternative methods to extract k, first via Eq. (63) and second through Eq. (71), are equivalent. In addition, we have stated that this equivalence can also be checked via direct application of the optical theorem in Eq. (78).
However, the numerical implementation can introduce small differences when a UV cutoff is employed. We name this the effect of truncation. This can be easily understood by looking at Eq. (78). The first method to compute k uses Im TDD, and a UV cutoff in |p| simply truncates the left-hand side of Eq. (78) at that momentum. On the other hand, the second method employs the right-hand side of Eq. (78), where the same cutoff is imposed on |TDa|2, but the term Im GRa is calculated analytically to perform the integrations. Therefore, the way in which a UV cutoff is imposed in the numerical calculations does not ensure that the truncation effect is the same for the two methods.
A first comparison between Figs. 6 and 7 does not show appreciable differences. In Fig. 8 we show the total k from the two methods in a single plot for better comparison. Note that the second method includes the three channels (elastic and inelastic) involving pions. Both methods compare very well for low momentum at all temperatures. We have checked that the good comparison persists between unitary and Landau cuts separately. We only obtain deviations at high momentum (hence cutoff effects). Nevertheless, the differences in k are at most 5%, and only for high momenta (which are in any case suppressed when folded with

2. Off-shell effects
We now describe the differences between the use of the on-shell and off-shell approaches. We have extensively described how to implement off-shell effects by keeping the full spectral function of the internal D-meson propagator, as opposed to using the narrow limit. To determine the differences we use the second method to compute k, including the three

FIG. 9. Thermal width of D mesons in a thermal pion gas. Comparison between the off-shell calculation (solid lines) (Eqs. (72)+(73)) and the on-shell one (dotted lines) (Eqs. (74)+(75)).

The results are presented in Fig. 9. The off-shell calculation is performed through Eqs. (72)+(73), and the spectral function SD is taken from the update of the results in Refs. [31, 32]. For the on-shell calculation we employ Eqs. (74)+(75) where the intermediate D meson is taken on shell (narrow limit). In both cases we use the same temperature dependent scattering amplitudes.
As expected, the effects of the spectral function width become more apparent at higher temperatures. When T  0 the thermal width goes to zero, and the narrow quasiparticle

29
approximation becomes exact in this limit. In any case, the quasiparticle peak is rather narrow at all temperatures considered, as was already reported in Ref. [32], and the off-shell effects are generically small. These effects are of the order of 10% for k at the highest temperature T = 150 MeV, and rather independent of the external momentum k.

3. Effect of inelastic channels
We now discuss the effect of inelastic channels in the second method to compute k, given by Eqs. (71),(72),(73). While their inclusion is strictly required to account for the coupled-channel optical theorem, in the practice, their effect is small. This can be seen in Fig. 10 for the case of the D-meson thermal width, only due to the pions of the medium. In that plot we show in solid lines the complete result with the three inelastic channels, and in dashed lines the result with only the elastic channel D  D. The effect is rather small for all T and k, and for the highest temperature T = 150 MeV and momentum they are at most 5%. Therefore, we will neglect the effect of inelastic channels in the calculations of transport coefficients.

4. Effects of the light mesons in the bath

While one can safely neglect the inelastic channels, one should not forget that there are four different elastic channels for the interactions of D mesons with light pseudoscalars (D, DK, DK¯ , D). While the contribution of the most massive mesons is also suppressed, they become increasingly important as the temperature is increased.
In order to study the effect of the contribution of the different species, we define an averaged thermal width (only function of temperature) as

(T )

=

1 nD

d3k f (0)(Ek)k ,

(80)

where f (0)(Ek) is the equilibrium Bose-Einstein distribution function and nD is the D-meson particle density.

In the left panel of Fig. 11 we show the contributions to the D-meson width coming from the different meson baths (, K, K¯ , ). As expected, the contribution of more massive

mesons is negligible at low temperatures due to the thermal suppression factor, and only

5. Comparison with previous approaches
Finally we compare our results (labelled as "full"), including unitary and Landau contributions, together with thermal amplitudes, inelastic channels, and off-shell effects, with the calculations of Refs [7, 55, 56]. These are shown in the right panel of Fig. 11. We focus on the thermal width of D mesons coming from the interaction with a thermal bath of only pions, and fix the D-meson momentum to k = 0. Fuchs et al. [55] use an effective interaction at lowest order between D mesons and pions and extract the width from the self-energy correction due to pions. He et al. [7] use a similar interaction based on Ref. [55], but compute the thermal width using a formula similar to Eq. (76). The two calculations provide similar results and they are fairly consistent with our results using the unitary cut alone (label "w/o Landau cut"). Notice that, apart from the different interaction, we also include inelastic channels while He et al in Ref. [7] do not. This partially explains why our curve is slightly larger than the other two. Then, Cleven et al. [56] perform a similar calculation to ours, but the effective approach is based on SU (4) chiral symmetry. Medium effects are also incorporated, including the Landau cut contributions, resulting in a D-meson thermal width almost twice larger that the previously discussed two approaches but still smaller than the

32
present results for temperatures higher than 100 MeV, the difference reaching around 30% at T = 150 MeV. This is probably due to the fact that the small mass shift of the D-meson, which in our model turns out to be attractive, is ignored in the results of Ref. [56], thereby making them to be less affected by the contributions of the sub-threshold Landau cut.
To summarize, in this section we have analyzed several contributions to the D-meson width and found that the effect of off-shell dynamics, inelastic channels and truncation errors are relatively small for the calculation of the D-meson thermal width. However the contribution of the Landau cut is essential to describe this coefficient at finite temperatures. We have shown that this contribution appears--thanks to exact unitarity considerations-- not only in the imaginary part of the retarded self-energy, but also in the collision term of the kinetic equation. Guided from the results in k, we expect that this contribution will be very important for the calculation of the D-meson transport coefficients as well.

IV. TRANSPORT COEFFICIENTS OF AN OFF-SHELL D-MESON
In this section we study the transport coefficients of a D meson, when thermal scattering amplitudes are implemented for the first time. In particular we analyze the drag force A and diffusion coefficients B0, B1, Ds, when all previous effects are incorporated. To properly define these coefficients, we first exploit the heavy mass of the D meson compared to other scales in the system, to reduce the off-shell kinetic equation in Eq. (46) to a Fokker-Planck equation [57, 58].

A. Reduction to an off-shell Fokker-Planck equation

Let us start with the off-shell kinetic equation (see Eq. (46)) where, for simplicity we

where we have replaced the variable k1 by the momentum loss q  k - k1. Equation (82) describes the collision rate of a D meson with energy k0 and momentum k to a final D meson with energy k10 and momentum k - q. It depends on the spectral weights and the populations of the particles 1, 2 and 3 of the binary collision, encoded in the Wightman functions. It can be interpreted as a collision loss term for a D meson with momentum k. In fact, the loss term of Eq. (81) can be directly written as,

(83)

The gain term of Eq. (81) can be interpreted as a loss term of an incoming D meson with momentum k1, losing the same momentum amount q and ending with momentum k (notice that k0 is an independent free variable). This term reads

(85)

This equation is an alternative form of Eq. (81), convenient for the formal reduction to the off-shell Fokker-Planck equation. For this purpose we exploit the separation of scales between the meson masses, as the mass of the D meson is much larger than the temperature, and any of the light-meson masses. Such a Brownian picture implies that the typical momentum exchanged in the elastic collision is of the order of T and much smaller than the total momentum of the heavy particle q k [9, 57, 58].

34

Then we can Taylor expand the combination W (k0, k + q, k10, q)G<D(X, k0, k + q) around k up to second order. In doing so, we consider a homogeneous thermal bath, as the light

sector is assumed to be equilibrated in much shorter time scales, so that one can employ a

space-averaged Green's function [58]. In addition, we also set zk 1 as usual.

After a few steps one obtains a Fokker-Planck equation for G<D(t, k0, k)

(90)

where the spectral function of the D meson is kept. We will use the relation of Eq. (90) to compute the off-shell transport coefficients in Eqs. (87) to (89). This approach stands at the same level of Eqs. (72) and (73), and accounts for thermal modifications, off-shell effects, as well as the Landau cut contributions (case  < 0). It will be denoted as "OffShell" in the following. This is the most complete calculation of transport coefficients used in this work.
It is important to notice that in general it is not possible to derive a Fokker-Planck equation for fD(t, k) including off-shell effects in the transport coefficients, because after k0 integration in both sides, one cannot factorize the distribution function from the transport coefficients. Only in the particular case of a narrow quasiparticle it is possible to trivially

6 In our previous works we have denoted the coefficients as F, 0 and 1, respectively. To avoid confusion with the thermal width k we have modified the notation to A, B0, B1, which is also a common choice in the literature.

35

integrate k0 and arrive to the kinetic equation for fD(t, k), thus reproducing the previous approaches in the literature [26, 29]. For the interested reader we detail the derivation of

the on-shell Fokker-Planck equation in Appendix B.

We remind that, although not explicitly written in Eq. (90), there is a sum over all

allowed (elastic+inelastic) channels in these expressions. However, as we have learned from

the thermal width, the contribution of the inelastic processes is very small, and therefore they will be neglected in what follows. Nevertheless, all elastic channels (D, DK, DK¯ ,

and D) will be added when computing the coefficients.

The described "OffShell" approximation, based on Eq. (90), is rather general. However we

already know that the quasiparticle approximation is excellent for the D mesons. Therefore

one can replace the D-meson spectral function by the expression in Eq. (55), and neglect

the zk factor altogether. This brings two consequences: 1) The Fokker-Planck equation in Eq. (86) for G<D(t, k) can be written for fD(t, k) instead,

and 2) the scattering rate gets simplified because, as for the Boltzmann equation, only one type of process is able to conserve energy-momentum when all 4 particles in the collision are on their mass shell. In this approximation it is possible to write,

where we have only considered elastic collisions, as in Eq. (57).

This expression looks closer to the previous calculations of the heavy-flavor transport coefficients, but the Landau contribution still remains in addition to the unitary one. Scattering amplitudes also include medium effects. This approximation to compute the transport coefficients will be denoted as "Thermal U+L".
One can yet consider another simplification, in which one simply sets the Landau contribution to zero. Notice that there is no reason to neglect this term in the medium, but we will consider this approximation--denoted as "Thermal U"--for the sake of comparison. In any case, this approximation should be realistic at low temperatures, where the Landau cuts dissapear. The scattering rate to be used in the "Thermal U" approximation reads

Finally, to match our results to previous approaches we will simply use Eq. (96) without any thermal effects neither in the quasiparticle energies nor the scattering amplitudes. We will use vacuum amplitudes and standard relativistic expressions for the energies Ek =
k2 + m2D, E1 = k12 + m2D where mD is the D-meson vacuum mass. This approximation is denoted as "Vacuum", as it is the one that most resembles our previous calculations.
We summarize in Table I the different approximations to compute the D-meson transport coefficients. It starts with the simplest one, where vacuum amplitudes without thermal corrections are used, to the most involved one, where thermal and off-shell effects are taken into account.

V. RESULTS FOR D-MESON TRANSPORT COEFFICIENTS

We start the description of our numerical results with the D-meson drag force A(k; T ) (or A^(k0, k; T ) in the off-shell case), and the momentum diffusion coefficient B0(k; T ) (B^0(k0, k; T ) for the off-shell approximation). We will present results in the so-called static limit k  0 (|k| = 50 MeV in the actual computation). In this limit B0 = B1, which we have checked numerically in all cases.
In Fig. 12 we present the drag force A (left panel) and the diffusion coefficient B0 (right panel) in three different approximations of Table I. "Vacuum" corresponds to the approximation used in our previous work [10], where vacuum scattering amplitudes and masses were employed.

All the remaining approximations use thermal scattering amplitudes and temperaturedependent quasiparticle energies. "Thermal U" only incorporates the unitary cut, and the differences with respect to "Vacuum" are entirely due to thermally dependent interactions. Rather surprisingly, we find no appreciable differences with respect to "Vacuum" even at high temperatures. The main difference comes from the addition of the Landau contribution, which is incorporated in the "Thermal U+L" scenario. At our top temperatures, the contribution of this cut is even more important than the one of the unitary cut. Recall that

38

this already happened for the D-meson thermal width in Sec. III. Finally we present our results incorporating off-shell effects, which employ the full spectral
distribution of the in-medium D meson. This approximation is denoted "OffShell" in Table I. In this case, to fix the external energy dependence we have simply set k0 = Ek with |k| = 50 MeV (static limit).

FIG. 13. Transport coefficients in the static limit (where B1 = B0) in the off-shell approximation. For comparison we also show the "Thermal U+L" approximation.

In Fig. 13 we plot the A and B0 coefficients in the "OffShell" case, compared to those from the "Thermal U+L" one. Only a small difference can be observed in A at high temperatures, concluding that the genuine off-shell effects are not as important in comparison with the onshell results of the "Thermal U+L" approximation. This already happened for the thermal width (see Fig. 9). This result is not very surprising as the D-meson spectral function is still very narrow for the temperatures considered here, so the quasiparticle approximation works extremely well. As in the "Thermal U+L" case, the "OffShell" approximation presents a substantial contribution of the Landau cut to the transport coefficients, absent in the vacuum case.
Notice that the off-shell approximation also allows for 1  3 processes. In this work we have neglected those because the required production threshold is higher than the elastic one. However, it would be very interesting to analyze the Bremsstrahlung processes D  D++ and their role in the D-meson energy loss. This is left for a future work.

We finally explore the spatial diffusion coefficient Ds(T ) [9]. This coefficient [usually

normalized by the thermal wavelength, 1/(2T )] can be obtained from the static limit of

the B0(k; T ) coefficient,

FIG. 14. Spatial diffusion coefficient [divided over the thermal wavelength (2T )-1] using different approximations in the on-shell limit (left panel) and with off-shell corrections at the quasiparticle peak (right panel).

This coefficient is shown in Fig. 14. In the left panel we present the comparison between the three on-shell approximations: "Vacuum", "Thermal U" and "Thermal U+L". The Landau contribution makes the diffusion coefficient to decrease almost by a factor of 3 close to Tc, which is a remarkable effect. The results for the "Thermal U+L" and "OffShell' are almost identical, as we compare the left and right panels of Fig. 14.
Let us comment that an alternative way to fix the k0 dependence of the off-shell transport coefficients is to define an average coefficient weighted by the D-meson spectral function. For example, one could define an average B0 as,



B0(k; T ) = 2 dk0k0SD(k0, k)B^0(k0, k; T ) .

(98)

In the narrow quasiparticle limit this average coincides with the on-shell evaluation if one

(99)

Because in our case the quasiparticle approximation works very well the evaluation of the off-shell coefficient at k0 = Ek gives similar results to the one using Eq. (98).

A. Comparison with other approaches

To conclude this study we compare our results below Tc to recent lattice-QCD calculations of the heavy-flavor transport coefficients for temperatures T Tc. We also include a recent calculation using Bayesian methods to analyze the HiC data under a simulation code to obtain a posterior estimation of the spatial diffusion coefficient [39]. In our case we will show our most complete calculation ("OffShell" approximation) together with the "Vacuum" calculation for comparison. From the lattice-QCD side we compile the results presented in Refs. [34­38]. All these are given as functions of T /Tc. To compare the different results in terms of an absolute temperature, we fix Tc = 156 MeV [59].
In the left panel of Fig. 15 we show the spatial diffusion coefficient as defined in Eq. (97). In the right panel we present the momentum diffusion coefficient  as it is usually defined in the lattice-QCD community. This coefficient is related to B0 in the static limit as,

(T ) = 2B0(k  0; T ) .

(100)

In fact this coefficient is not independent of Ds as  = 4T 3/(2T Ds). Nevertheless we provide the results of /T 3 to stress the plausible matching, where a possible maximum happens at the crossover temperature.
Details of the different lattice-QCD calculations can be found in their corresponding publications. All of them are characterized by the use of the quenched approximation (SU (3) pure glue plasma) and with different ranges of temperature (Refs. [35, 36, 38] only provide results for a characteristic temperature of 1.5Tc). With the exception of the calculation in [34] all results take the lattice continuum limit. The majority of the calculations use a multilevel update to reduce noise [34­37], except for the most recent [38] which employs gradient flow.

FIG. 15. Left panel: Spatial diffusion coefficient (normalized by the thermal wavelength) around Tc. Right panel: Momentum diffusion coefficient /T 3 = 2B0/T 3 around Tc.

We observe a very good matching around Tc between our results, the lattice-QCD data and the result from a Bayesian analysis [39], especially for the case with thermal and off-shell effects included. This is better seen for the /T 3 coefficient.
We now comment on the comparison of "Vacuum" approximation to our previous calculation in Ref. [10] using vacuum amplitudes. In that work we reported a similar diffusion coefficient with slightly smaller values at high temperatures, e.g. at T = 150 MeV the value 2T Ds 8 (here we obtain 2T Ds 12). In turn, the A and B0, B1 coefficients were systematically larger in [10]. The differences come from several improvements with respect to that work: 1) The LECs of the effective Lagrangian are fixed here thanks to recent lattice-QCD calculations [60], while in [10] we followed a less rigorous procedure of fixing the LECs by matching the mass and width of the D(2400) resonance (whose properties reported by the PDG, in turn, have changed since then); and 2) here we adopt a full consistent coupled-channel approach, while in [10] this was done only partially (for example, the channels involving Ds were not considered there).
We should finally mention that for T > Tc we have only shown the results coming from lattice QCD and Bayesian calculations, but there exist many theoretical calculations of these coefficients using different models or effective approaches [7, 17, 18, 22, 25, 26, 29, 61­64].

42
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this work we have extended the kinetic theory description of D mesons at low energy to include medium (thermal) effects and spectral properties of open-charm states [31, 32]. In particular, we have derived the off-shell Boltzmann and Fokker-Planck equations from the D-meson effective-field theory in the T -matrix approximation.
As an application, we have calculated the D-meson thermal width (or damping rate), the drag force coefficient, the diffusion coefficients in momentum space, and the spatial diffusion coefficient. These transport coefficients were previously computed using vacuum amplitudes employing on-shell kinetic equations [10]. Here we achieve a consistent formulation between in-medium interactions with light mesons and an off-shell kinetic approach.
Due to their large vacuum mass, thermal corrections and spectral broadening of D mesons are relatively small, so that the quasiparticle picture is maintained for the temperature range considered in this work. For this reason, it is still appropriate to consider a Fokker-Planck reduction of the Boltzmann equation to describe this system. We have derived an off-shell Fokker-Planck equation, where the kinetic coefficients are now interpreted as "off-shell" transport coefficients. We have shown that, in general, there is no off-shell Fokker-Planck extension for the D-meson distribution function fD(t, k) [only for the Wightman function G<D(t, k0, k)], unless the extreme narrow limit of the spectral functions is used. In this limit a clear connection to previous approaches can be made.
Our main observation is that the use of thermal scattering amplitudes causes the appearance of a new kinematic range in the meson-meson interaction, the so-called Landau contribution. We have found that the contribution to the transport coefficients is rather large at moderate temperatures, even for on-shell D mesons. In fact, it dominates all dissipative coefficients at temperatures above 100 MeV, and at T = 150 MeV this new contribution is as large as the standard contribution due to the unitary cut. While these new effects modify substantially the transport coefficients close to Tc, the final results are consistent with lattice-QCD determinations of the momentum and spatial diffusion coefficients. For a fully consistent matching with some lattice-QCD results (which use the infinite quark mass limit) it is necessary to increase the mass of our heavy hadron. We leave for a future work the calculation using B mesons [12, 13, 65, 66], and the analysis of the validity of heavy-quark flavor symmetry at finite temperatures. As an alternative (and complementary) approach

43
to the Fokker-Planck equation, it would be interesting to perform a study of the Langevin equation from the perspective of the Kadanoff-Baym formalism [67].

Appendix A: Wigner transform to different pieces

For any two-point function e.g. the Wightman function G<D(x, y), one can define its Wigner transform (WT) as

G<D(x, y) --W-T- G<D(X, k) 

d4s eik·s G<D

X

+

s 2

,

X

-

s 2

,

(A1)

where we have introduced the center-of-mass and relative coordinates, X = (x + y)/2 and s = x - y, respectively [41, 45, 46].
We apply the Wigner transform to all the terms of the off-shell kinetic equation (See Eq. (27)). The first term includes the following combination,

G-0 1(x)G<D(x, y) - G-0 1(y)G<D(x, y) ,

(A2)

44

where G-0 1(x) = -x2 - m2D. In terms of X and s it reads

G-0 1(x)G<D(x, y) - G-0 1(y)G<D(x, y) = -[x2 - y2]G<D(x, y) = -2s · X G<D

X

(A3)

Then we multiply this term by eik·s and integrate over d4s to obtain,

G-0 1(x)G<D(x, y) - G-0 1(y)G<D(x, y)

--W-T-

2ikµ

G<D(X, Xµ

k)

,

(A4)

where the derivative over s transforms into a 4-momentum kµ. This technique is applied to all the remaining terms in the kinetic equation, implementing
at the same time a gradient expansion in X. The latter allows to neglect higher order terms in Xµ , like X2 G>D(X, k). For example, in the first commutator of Eq. (27) one finds the factor (x), which is expanded as

(x) = 

X

(A5)

where we neglect higher-order terms in X. Then, the combination -(x) + (y) becomes -s · X(X) + O(X2 ). Up to this order the Wigner transform gives,

[-(x) + (y)]G<D(x, y)

--W-T-

(A6)

where the factor sµ produces the operator kµ. Let us consider the convolution of two operators,

C(x, y)  (A  B)(x, y) = d4zA(x, z)B(z, y) .

(A7)

It is possible to show that after WT it becomes [46]

C(x, y) --W-T- A(X, k) exp

i -2

- - - - X · k - k · X

B(X, k) ,

(A8)

where the derivative operators act to the direction marked by their arrows. Applying the gradient expansion and keeping first order in X, we can simplify it to,

C (x,

--W-T-

A(X, k) B(X, k)

(A10)

45

Then using Eq. (A9) one finds that the anticommutators appearing in the collision terms of Eqs. (27) and (28),

{ , GD}(x, y) = (  GD)(x, y) + (GD  )(x, y) ,

transform to

{ , GD}(x, y) --W-T- 2(X, k)GD(X, k) ,

as the Poisson brackets cancel ({A, B}PB = -{B, A}PB). However, for the commutators like

(A11) (A12)

- [R/A , GD](x, y) = -(R/A  GD)(x, y) + (GD  R/A)(x, y)

the Poisson bracket is the only remaining piece,

- [R/A , GD](x, y) --W-T- -i{R/A, GD}PB .

Similarly,

- [ , GRD/A] --W-T- -i{, GRD/A}PB .

Applying these rules to the different terms in Eq. (27), then Eq. (30) follows.

Appendix B: On-shell Fokker-Planck equation

We stress again that upon the integration over dk0/(2) of Eq. (B1) it is not possible to obtain the standard Fokker-Planck equation with "on-shell" coefficients depending only on k, due to the presence of a D meson with a generic spectral function. To match the previous results and derive the "on-shell" version of the coefficients one needs to apply the Kadanoff-Baym ansatz of Eqs. (44) and (45), and particularize for the narrow quasiparticle limit of the spectral function in Eq. (55) with zk 1,

The expressions of the coefficients in Eqs. (B8), (B9) and (B10) together with the on-shell scattering rate in Eq. (B12) coincide with those used in our previous works [9, 10, 15], apart from the Landau term arising in Eq. (B12), which is the new contribution found in the present work.
