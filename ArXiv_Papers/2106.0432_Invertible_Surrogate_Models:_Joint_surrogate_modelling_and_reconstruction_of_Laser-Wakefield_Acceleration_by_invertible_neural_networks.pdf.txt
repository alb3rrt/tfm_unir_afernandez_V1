ABSTRACT
Invertible neural networks are a recent technique in machine learning promising neural network architectures that can be run in forward and reverse mode. In this paper, we will be introducing invertible surrogate models that approximate complex forward simulation of the physics involved in laser plasma accelerators: iLWFA. The bijective design of the surrogate model also provides all means for reconstruction of experimentally acquired diagnostics. The quality of our invertible laser wakefield acceleration network will be verified on a large set of numerical LWFA simulations.
1 INTRODUCTION
Laser plasma accelerators are a new technique to accelerate charged particles, providing acceleration gradients orders of magnitude higher than with conventional accelerators. One of the most established techniques is the so-called laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) (Tajima & Dawson, 1979; Esarey et al., 2009). A short and intense laser pulse drives a plasma wave inside which electrons can be accelerated. Especially in the so-called blowout or bubble regime (Pukhov & Meyer-ter Vehn, 2002; Geddes et al., 2004; Faure et al., 2004; Mangles et al., 2004), quasi-monoenergetic electron bunches with pulse duration and extent in the range of a few fs and few µm can be generated which are not achievable by conventional accelerators. One of the most commonly used methods to inject electrons into the plasma accelerator is downramp injection (Schmid et al., 2010; Buck et al., 2013; Swanson et al., 2017), during which the plasma wake transitions from a high- to a low-density region, thereby expanding the plasma cavity and, if the laser is strong enough, injecting electrons that are further accelerated. This injection method can provide significantly better beam quality compared to other injection methods (Barber et al., 2017). The injection process depends both on the laser evolution as well as on the plasma dynamics, which are nonlinearly coupled. During the consecutive acceleration, the beam quality is influenced by the complex interplay between beam and wake, called beam loading Couperus et al. (2017). Making predictions for the injection process and acceleration thus require modeling with large-scale particle-in-cell simulations (Martinez de la Ossa et al., 2017). A surrogate model for these simulations is highly desireable since the simulations are highly computationally demanding even for highly-optimized particle-in-cell codesBurau et al. (2010), A fast prediction of electron parameters of interest could accelerate the applicability of down-ramp injection methods even further. Main contributions of this paper is the introduction of invertible surrogate modelling applied to accelerator physics. The proposed invertible LWFA surrogate model (iLWFA) approximates the non-linear forward simulation of LWFA with focus on down-ramp injection. Furthermore, the choice of architecture allows us to jointly solve the inverse problem, i.e. reconstruction of simulation parameters based on energy spectra.

2 RELATED WORKS

Figure 1: The prediction of the iLWFA network (red) on validation data very closely approximates the energy spectrum of numerical particle-in-cell code (blue) in a fraction of time. The spectrum shows the final charge of the electrons per unit energy dQ/dE=^  over energy E. For this particular parameter set p, the most electrons end up to have an energy between 180 MeV and 250 MeV.

Computationally expensive simulations are necessary for simulation of complex physical processes. Scanning the input parameters of physical simulations significantly increases the runtime of the simulations, since the simulation has to be cold-started over and over again. Surrogate models which are able to learn the relationship among the input parameters and the simulation output could significantly lower the computational complexity and enables more extensive analysis of the underlying physical system without restarting the simulation every time.
Neural networks are a valuable choice as surrogate models due to their ability as universal function approximators (Hornik et al., 1989). Certain established approaches rely on the multilayer perceptron architecture (Raissi et al., 2017; Sirignano & Spiliopoulos, 2017; Stiller et al., 2020) while more sophisticated approaches such as generative adversial networks, autoencoders (Xie et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019) and graph neural networks are also used (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020). However, all these approaches are designed as surrogates for the forward process of the underlying simulation, so that the inverse mapping must be represented by a separate model (e.g. (Raissi & Karniadakis, 2017), (Raissi, 2018)).
Invertible neural networks are a promising candidate as surrogate models through there ability to learn the forward and inverse mapping simultaneously. Padmanabha & Zabaras (2020) applied a conditional invertible neural network as a surrgogate model for the estimation of a non-Gaussian permeability field in multiphase flows. In this paper, we will be learning an invertible conditional mapping between simulation parameters and -outcomes by adapting the architecture of (Ardizzone et al., 2018), which is more challenging to train but promises a more accurate approximation of the forward pass (simulation) and the inverse process (reconstruction).

of parameters p given the energy spectrum , i.e. f () = p. The reconstruction can be seen as

(ill-posed) inverse process of our surrogate model which, however, might not be injective due to loss

of information as the energy spectrum might not represent the full state of the system. This means

that certain parameters pj, pk might map to the same energy spectrum , i.e. g(pj) = g(pk) = . This ambiguity implies that any neural network n  f would either pick any of the feasible

parameters or return the average of both, depending on the choice of architecture and objective function. We approach this challenge by invertible neural networks (Ardizzone et al., 2018) that allow us to recover the full posterior predictive distribution of p given the observed energy spectrum , i.e. P (p|, z) = f (, z). The modes of this posterior predictive distribution P (p|, z) correspond to all parameter configurations explaining the observed energy spectrum .

The main idea of an invertible surrogate model for Laser-Wakefield acceleration is that some neural

networks transform a simple multivariate base distribution z  Z = N (0, I) with zero mean and identity matrix I into a complex posterior distribution of parameters P subject to observation  in terms of a non-linear function f (, z). The posterior can be derived by the change-of-variables

approach as of

f (, z|)

P = Z det [T , zT ]

given parameters  of f (·). This architecture allows us to resolve ambiguous mappings since f (·) is trained such taht it transforms different parts of our base distribution Z to each mode of the data distribution while any simpler data-driven approach would either pick one mode or return the average value of all corresponding parameters. It has been shown that this choice of architecture is able to return the true posterior distribution (Ardizzone et al., 2018).

The function f (·) is defined by a composition of L affine coupling transforms (Dinh et al., 2016).
The input u(l) to the l-th coupling transform is split into two equally sized halves u(l) = [u(1l), u(2l)] and gets transformed into v(l) = [v1, v2] according to

v1(l) = u(1l) · exp(s(l)(u(2l))) + t(l)(u(2l))

(2)

v2(l) = u(2l) · exp(s(l)(v1(l))) + t(l)(v1(l))

for any block 1  l  L of coupling transform and fully-connected neural networks s(l), t(l). This
design can be seen as a modified version of the GLOW approach (Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018). Finally, we need to introduce some zero-padding to the co-domain of f : RME+Mz  RMp+M0 to learn a bijective mapping, i.e. [, z] = u(1)  RME+Mz and [p, 0] = v(L)  RMp+M0 with Mp + M0 = ME + Mz. ME denotes the number of energy bins of our energy spectra  while Mp is the number of parameters (here: 3), Mz is the size of our latent variable z and M0 the resulting zero-padding. This choice of coupling transform is easily invertible and leads to a triangular
Jacobian structure such that the Jacobian determinant of eqn. 1 can be computed computationally
inexpensively (Dinh et al., 2016). Additionally, the affine coupling transforms also enable fast inference times of the forward direction (surrogate model), i.e. g(p) = IN N (p, 0) = [, z] as well as
the reverse direction (reconstruction).

The bidirectional training of the invertible surrogate model is carried out by minimizing our objective function L with respect to the parameters  of all subnetworks s(l), t(l),

L = L + pLp + zLz

(3)

with L being the supervised forward loss, Lp is the supervised reconstruction loss and Lz preserves the prior distribution of the latent variable z. The Lagrange multipliers p, z scale each term of our

objective function accordingly. The supervised forward loss,

L = ||i - i||1

(4)

i=0

enforces similarity of the approximated forward simulation [i, z] = f (pi, 0) with ground-truth energy spectrum i of parameter pi. The reconstruction loss Lp reads

N

Lp = (||pi - pi||22 + ||0i||22)

(5)

i=0

with [pi, 0i] = g(i, z). All terms are evaluated at at N samples of the training set. The latter term of Lp enforces that the invertible network is not encoding any information into the predicted zero-
padding 0 of g. Finally, the predicted latent variable z is regularized by maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as of (Ardizzone et al., 2018),

Lz = M M D(f (p, 0), z)

to enforce normality of z and independence to the predicted .

4 RESULTS & DISCUSSION
All 2.7 Terabytes of training data were generated by large scale PIConGPU (Bussmann et al., 2013; Burau et al., 2010) simulations run by a jupyter-based scheduler (Rudat, 2019). In the following the 3 input parameters to the PIConGPU simulations are: the laser's normalized field strength a0, the laser's focus position zfocus with zfocus = 105 µm representing a focus position at the density downramp, and the length of the downramp density transition Ldownramp from a density 2 · 1019 cm-3 to 1.1 · 1019 cm-3. Weights  of our objective function were subject to a hyperparameter optimisation. The best architecture consists of latent distribution z with Mz = 20 and a stack of 10 coupling transforms. Each transform consists of two fully-connected neural networks with four hidden layers amounting to 2.9 M parameters for that transform. The total number of parameter of the invertible surrogate model is  29 M .
4.1 SURROGATE MODEL
The performance of our iLWFA model was assessed by randomly splitting our dataset into training and validation data. We found that the approximation of the forward pass yields a mean squared error of M SE < 0.007 meaning that the energy spectra were recovered reasonable well (see e.g. Fig. 1). Furthermore, the similarity in shape of the reconstructed energy spectra with respect to groundtruth data was quantified by structured-similarity index SSIM  0.86, i.e. the recovered energy spectra closely resemble the ground-truth data. The reconstruction of simulation parameters given an energy spectrum relates to solving an inverse problem. iLWFA allows us to solve this inverse problem by querying the invertible neural network in reverse mode. A representative reconstruction of the posterior predictive distribtuion on validation data emphasizes the strengths of INNs for learning complex posterior distributions (see Fig. 2). The median relative errors for reconstruction of simulation parameters from energy spectra is rather low (see table 1) meaning that the invertible network is learning features for joint forward simulation as well as parameter reconstruction. The good reconstruction performance on a0 could be explained by strong contribution of that parameter to the reconstructed energy spectra (see Fig. 4).
4.2 DIRECT PHYSICAL APPLICATION OF THE SURROGATE MODEL
Various beam parameters need to be tuned simultaneously to achieve a certain LWFA downramp injection for a targeted application. For examples narrow energy bandwidth E around a high peak energy Epeak is required for operating Thomson scattering light sources Jochmann et al. (2013); Kra¨mer et al. (2018) or compact optical FELs Steiniger et al. (2019). On the other hand, using these electron beams as driver in a compact plasma wakefield accelerator Kurz et al. (2021), requires high-current beams, thus a high peak energy is needed but the requirements on E are less strict.

5 CONCLUSIONS
Laser wakefield acceleration is an established compact accelerator method promising significantly higher acceleration gradients than conventional particle accelerators. The numerical simulation of the involved complex physics requires jointly solving kinematic- and Maxwell's equation using particle-in-cell method. Main contribution of this work is an invertible surrogate model, iLWFA, that is approximating the forward pass of a full LWFA simulation while providing all means for reconstruction of experimentally acquired quantities. Another benefit of ML-driven surrogate models is the differentiability of the model allowing us to infer physical knowledge from the incorporated non-linear mapping. An evaluation on large set of numerical LWFA simulations emphasizes the benefits of this approach but also outlines future work for making the reconstruction more robust.
