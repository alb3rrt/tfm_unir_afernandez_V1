A NOTE ON A SPECTRAL CONSTANT ASSOCIATED
WITH AN ANNULUS
GEORGIOS TSIKALAS
Abstract. Fix R > 1 and let AR = {1/R  |z|  R} be an annulus. Also, let K(R) denote the smallest constant such that AR is a K(R)-spectral set for the bounded linear operator T  B(H) whenever ||T ||  R and ||T -1||  R. We show that K(R)  2, for all R > 1. This improves on previous results by Badea, Beckermann and Crouzeix.
1. BACKGROUND
Let X be a closed set in the complex plane and let R(X) denote the algebra of complex-valued bounded rational functions on X, equipped with the supremum norm
||f ||X = sup{|f (x)| : x  X}.
Suppose that T is a bounded linear operator acting on the (complex) Hilbert space H. Suppose also that the spectrum (T ) of T is contained in the closed set X. Let f = p/q  R(X). As the poles of the rational function f are outside of X, the operator f (T ) is naturally defined as f (T ) = p(T )q(T )-1 or, equivalently, by the Riesz-Dunford functional calculus (see e.g. [4] for a treatment of this topic).
Recall that for a fixed constant K > 0, the set X is said to be a K-spectral set for T if (T )  X and the inequality ||f (T )||  K||f ||X holds for every f  R(X). The set X is a spectral set for T if it is a K-spectral set with K = 1. Spectral sets were introduced and studied by von Neumann in [8], where he proved the celebrated result that an operator T is a contraction if and only if the closed unit disk is a spectral set for T (we refer the reader to the book [9] and the survey [2] for more detailed presentations and more information on K-spectral sets).
We will be concerned with the case where X = AR := {1/R  |z|  R} (R > 1) is a closed annulus, the intersection of the two closed disks D1 = {|z|  R} and D2 = {|z|  1/R}. Now, the intersection of two spectral sets is not necessarily a spectral set; counterexamples for the annulus were presented in [7], [10] and [12]. However, the same question for K-spectral sets remains open (the counterexamples for spectral sets show that the same constant cannot be used for the intersection). Regarding the annulus in particular, Shields proved in [11] that, given an invertible operator T  B(H) with ||T ||  R and ||T -1||  R, AR is a K-spectral set for T with K = 2 + (R2 + 1)/(R2 - 1). This bound is large if R is close to 1. In

this context, Shields raised the question of finding the smallest constant K = K(R) such that AR is K(R)-spectral. In particular, he asked whether this optimal constant K(R) would remain bounded.
This question was answered positively by Badea, Beckermann and Crouzeix in [3], where they obtained that (for every R > 1)

.

It should be noted that the quantity (R) was numerically shown to be greater than or equal to /2 (leading to the universal lower bound /2 for K(R)) and it also tends to 2 as R tends to infinity.
Two subsequent improvements were made to the upper bound for K(R): the first one in [5] by Crouzeix and the most recent one in [6] by Crouzeix and Greenbaum, where it was proved that
 K(R)  1 + 2, R > 1.

As for the lower bound, Badea obtained in [1] the statement

K (R),

R > 1,

where the quantity 2(1 + R2 + R)/(1 + R2 + 2R) again tends to 2 as R tends

to infinity.

We improve the aforementioned estimates by showing that 2 is actually a

universal lower bound for K(R):

Theorem 1.1. Put AR = {1/R  |z|  R}, for any R > 1. Let K(R) denote the smallest positive constant such that AR is a K(R)-spectral set for the bounded linear operator T  B(H) whenever ||T ||  R and ||T -1||  R.
Then,
K(R)  2, R > 1.

2. PROOF OF THEOREM 1.1

Proof. Fix R > 1. For every n  2, define

gn(z)

 R(AR).

It is easy to see that

(2.1)

||gn||AR

.

To achieve the stated improvement, we will apply gn to a bilateral shift operator S acting on a particular weighted sequence space L2(). First,
define the sequence {(k)}kZ of positive numbers (weights) as follows:

(2ln + q) = Rq, q  {0, 1, . . . , n}, l  Z;

((2l + 1)n + q) = Rn-q, q  {0, 1, . . . , n}, l  Z.

Consider now the space of sequences f = {f^(k)}kZ such that
||f ||2 := |f^(k)|2[(k)]2 < .
kZ

A NOTE ON A SPECTRAL CONSTANT ASSOCIATED WITH AN ANNULUS 3

We shall use the notation f (z) = kZ f^(k)zk (formal Laurent series), whether or not the series converges for any (complex) values of z. Our weighted sequence space will be denoted by
L2() := {f = {f^(k)}kZ : ||f ||2 < }.
This is a Hilbert space with the inner product

f, g  := f^(k)g^(k)[(k)]2.
kZ
Consider also the linear transformation (bilateral shift) S of multiplication by z on L2():
(Sf )(z) = f^(n)zn+1.
kZ
In other words, we have

(Sf )(n) = f^(n - 1), n  Z.

Observe that

||S||

=

sup
kZ

(k + 1) (k)

=

and

||S-1||

=

(k) (k + 1)

Now, let m  3 and define h = {h^(k)}kZ  L2() by putting:

h^(2ln)

=

1 m

,

l  {0, 1, 2 . . . , m2};

h^(k) = 0, in all other cases.

We calculate

Also, put f = (S-n + Sn)h and notice that

||(S-n + Sn)h||2 = ||f ||2

Thus, (2.3)
