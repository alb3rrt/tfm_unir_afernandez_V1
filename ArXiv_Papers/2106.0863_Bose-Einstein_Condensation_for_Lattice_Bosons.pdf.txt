Bose-Einstein Condensation for Lattice Bosons
Tohru Koma 1
Abstract: We present a class of models of interacting lattice bosons which show complete Bose-Einstein condensation for the ground state.
1 Introduction
As is well known, it is very difficult to prove the existence of Bose-Einstein condensation for interacting bosons. Actually, the mathematically rigorous results are still rare. (See, e.g., [1, 2] and references therein.) In this paper, we present a class of interacting boson models on the d-dimensional hypercubic lattice for d  1. We prove that the models show complete Bose-Einstein condensation for the ground state. Although the interactions in the Hamiltonians are not necessarily standard, each of them is finite range or rapidly decays with the diameter of the support.
The present paper is organized as follows: In the next Sec. 2, we give the precise definition of the simplest model in our class and the corresponding theorem with the proof. In Sec. 3, general models in our class are presented, and we also give an argument about the absence of Bose-Einstein condensation [3] for certain models at zero temperature. However, the argument is not necessarily mathematically rigorous.

2 Model and Result

We begin with the simplest model in our class. The extension to general models will be given in the next Sec. 3.
We consider a Bose gas on a d-dimensional hypercubic lattice   Zd with the dimension d  1. The Hamiltonian with nearest neighbor hopping and nearest neighbor interactions is given by

Hg(N )

:=

1 2

(ax -ay)(ax -ay)+g

[nx(nx -1)+nxny -axnxay -aynxax],

x,y:|x-y|=1

x,y:|x-y|=1

(2.1)

where ax and ax are, respectively, the creation and annihilation operators at the site x = (x(1), x(2), . . . , x(d)) in the finite lattice   Zd; nx := axax is the number operator at the site x, and g  0 is the coupling constant. As usual, the operators, ax and ax, obey

the commutation relations,

[ax, ay] = x,y, [ax, ay] = 0, and [ax, ay] = 0.

We fix the total number of the bosons to x nx = N , and we impose the periodic boundary condition. Then, the Fourier transform of the operator ax is given by

a^k :=

1 ||

x

e-ikxax,

where k := (k(1), k(2), . . . , k(d)) is the momentum, and kx =

d i=1

k(i)x(i);

||

denotes

the

number of the sites in the finite lattice . The inverse is

ax =

1 ||

k

eikxa^k.

(2.2)

By using this expression, the kinetic term of the Hamiltonian Hg(N) is written

H0(N) =

Ek a^k a^k

k

with the standard dispersion relation,

(2.3)

d
Ek := (1 - cos k(i)).
i=1

The complete Bose-Einstein condensation state is given by

(BNE)C

:=

1 N

!

(a^0)N

|0

,

(2.4) (2.5)

where |0 is the vacuum state, i.e., a^k|0 = 0 for all the momenta k.

Our result is:

Theorem 2.1 The complete Bose-Einstein condensation state (BNE)C is the unique ground state of the Hamiltonian Hg(N) of (2.1) for any coupling constant g  0 in any dimensions d  1.

Proof: The summand of the interaction term of the Hamiltonian Hg(N) of (2.1) is written

nx(nx - 1) + nxny - axnxay - aynxax = (ax - ay)axax(ax - ay).

(2.6)

One notices that this right-hand side is positive. Using the expression (2.2) of the operator ax in terms of a^k, one has

ax - ay =

1 ||

(eikx - eiky)a^k =
k

1 ||

(eikx
k=0

-

eiky )a^k .

(2.7)

Namely, the two contributions of the zero momentum mode a^0 cancel with each other in

the sum. Therefore, one has

(ax - ay)(BNE)C = 0.

(2.8)

Combining this with (2.6), the summand of the interaction term also annihilates the state

(BNE)C, i.e.,

[nx(nx - 1) + nxny - axnxay - aynxax](BNE)C = 0.

(2.9)

Immediately,

(BNE)C, Hi(nNt )(BNE)C = 0,

(2.10)

where we have written Hi(nNt ) := Hg(N) - H0(N) for the interaction term of the Hamiltonian

Hg(N). This yields

(BNE)C, Hg(N)(BNE)C = 0

(2.11)

for the total Hamiltonian Hg(N) as well. We write (GNS) for the ground state of Hg(N). Then, from this result (2.11), we have

0 = B(NE)C, Hg(N)B(NE)C  (GNS), Hg(N)(GNS) 

Ek (GNS), a^ka^k(GNS)  0,

k

(2.12)

where we have used the positivity Hi(nNt )  0 which is obtained from the positivity (2.6). This implies
(GNS), a^ka^k(GNS) = 0
for all k = 0. Thus, we obtain (GNS) = (BNE)C, and the ground state is unique.

Remark: The method in the above proof is similar to that in [4]. Namely, both of kinetic and interaction terms in a Hamiltonian annihilate a state.

3 Extension to a Class of Models and Discussion

In this section, we extend the model of (2.1) and Theorem 2.1 to general models. We also discuss certain interactions for which the absence of Bose-Einstein condensation can be expected at zero temperature.
A straightforward extension of (2.6) is as follows: Consider an interaction Hamiltonian,

Hi(nNt ) = g

CxAxCx,

x

(3.1)

where Ax is a positive local operator and Cx is a local operator which is written in the form,

Cx = j axj ,

(3.2)

j

with coefficients j which satisfy j j = 0. We can also choose Cx to be

Cx = K(x - y)ay,
y

(3.3)

where the function K(x - y) is given by the Fourier transform of K^ (k), i.e.,

K(x

-

y)

=

1 ||

K^ (k)eik(x-y).

k

(3.4)

When the function K^ (k) is sufficiently many times differentiable and satisfies K^ (0) = 0, the operator Cx is local and annihilates the state (BNE)C. Actually, one has

Cx =

1 ||

k

K^ (k)a^keikx.

(3.5)

Conversely, when the function K^ (k) has a narrow distribution with a high peak at k = 0, we can expect the absence of Bose-Einstein condensation for the zero momentum mode. In fact, one has

Cx =

1 ||

K^ (0)a^0

+

1 ||

k=0

K^ (k)a^keikx.

(3.6)

If we choose Ax = axax for the operator Ax in (3.1), then the contribution of the zero momentum mode in (3.1) is written

1 ||

(K^

(0))2a^0Ax

a^0

=

1 ||

(K^

(0))2a^0

axaxa^0

=

N ||

(K^

(0))2a^0a^0

,

x

x

(3.7)

where we have used x axax = N . This right-hand side raises the energy by order of the volume || with the large amplitude (K^ (0))2 for a fixed particle density N/|| when the

4

zero momentum mode exhibits a long-range order. Therefore, the long-range order of the zero momentum mode is expected to be suppressed for a large K^ (0) > 0.
When K^ (k) = 1 for all k, one has K(x - y) = x,y from (3.4). Then, we have

Hi(nNt ) = g nx(nx - 1)
x

(3.8)

for Ax = axax, from (3.1) and (3.3). This is one of the standard interactions [5]. However, it seems to be very difficult to prove the existence of Bose-Einstein condensation in this case because the function K^ (k) = 1 is an intermediate function in the above class.
Thus, in general, whether Bose-Einstein condensation occurs or not is expected to depend on interactions of models. In particular, it may depend on the dimension [3] of the lattice.
