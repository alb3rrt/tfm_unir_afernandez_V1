## Abstract

We study the performance of a proportional weights algorithm for online capacitated bipartite matching modeling the delivery of impression ads. The algorithm uses predictions on the advertiser nodes to match arriving impression nodes fractionally in proportion to the weights of its neighbors. This paper gives a thorough empirical study of the performance of the algorithm on a data-set of ad impressions from Yahoo! and shows its superior performance compared to natural baselines such as a greedy water-filling algorithm and the ranking algorithm. The proportional weights algorithm has recently received interest in the theoretical literature where it was shown to have strong guarantees beyond the worst-case model of algorithms augmented with predictions. We extend these results to the case where the advertisers' capacities are no longer stationary over time. Additionally, we show the algorithm has near optimal performance in the random-order arrival model when the number of impressions and the optimal matching are sufficiently large.
