On the Steklov spectrum of covering spaces and total spaces
Panagiotis Polymerakis
Abstract We show the existence of a natural Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on Riemannian manifolds with boundary and bounded geometry, such that the bottom of the Dirichlet spectrum is positive. This map regarded as a densely defined operator in the L2-space of the boundary admits Friedrichs extension. We focus on the spectrum of this operator on covering spaces and total spaces of Riemannian principal bundles over compact manifolds.
1 Introduction
During the last years, the Steklov spectrum of compact Riemannian manifolds has been extensively studied, and analogues of various results on the Dirichlet and the Neumann spectrum have been established (cf. for instance the survey [12], or [10] and the references therein). However, the Steklov spectrum of non-compact Riemannian manifolds has not attracted that much attention yet. This is reasonable, since even the definition of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps is quite more complicated in this case. Indeed, there may exist compactly supported smooth functions on the boundary of such a manifold which do not admit unique harmonic extension even under constraints, such as square-integrability or boundedness, or the normal derivative of the harmonic extension does not satisfy integrability conditions to give rise to an operator in a Hilbert space.
In this paper, we focus on a certain Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on Riemannian manifolds with boundary and bounded geometry, in the sense of [14, 23]. For a Riemannian manifold M with boundary, we denote by  the outward pointing unit normal to the boundary, and by D0 (M) the bottom of the Dirichlet spectrum of M. The basis of our discussion is that if D0 (M) > 0, then there exists a natural Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on M, as illustrated in the following.

Theorem 1.1. Let M be a Riemannian manifold with boundary and bounded geometry, such that D0 (M) > 0. Then any f  Cc(M) admits a unique square-integrable harmonic extension Hf  C(M). Moreover, this extension satisfies (Hf )  L2(M).
The main ingredient in the preceding theorem is that the square-integrable harmonic extension actually belongs to H2(M). This relies on elliptic estimates on manifolds with boundary and bounded geometry, which were recently proved in [14]. In view of Theorem 1.1, we may consider the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map
 : Cc(M )  L2(M )  L2(M ), f  (Hf ).
This linear operator admits Friedrichs extension, being densely-defined, symmetric and non-negative definite. The spectrum of this self-adjoint operator is called the Steklov spectrum of M. It is worth to point out that if M is compact, then this definition coincides with the standard one in the literature. The first part of this paper is devoted to the study of some basic properties of this operator.
In the second part of the paper, we focus on the behavior of the Steklov spectrum under Riemannian coverings. The philosophy of such results is that some properties of the fundamental group of a compact manifold are reflected in the geometry of its universal covering space. A classic result in this direction is due to Brooks [5] asserting that the fundamental group of a closed (that is, compact and without boundary) Riemannian manifold is amenable if and only if the bottom of the spectrum of the Laplacian on its universal covering space is zero. The analogous results for manifolds with boundary involving the Dirichlet and the Neumann spectrum have been recently established in [19]. It is also worth to mention that according to [20], if the fundamental group of the manifold is amenable then its spectrum is contained in the spectrum of its universal covering space.
It is noteworthy that any covering space of a compact manifold with boundary has bounded geometry, and the bottom of its Dirichlet spectrum is positive. Hence, we may define the Steklov spectrum of the covering space as above. In this setting, we prove the analogue of Brooks' result for manifolds with boundary involving the Steklov spectrum.
Theorem 1.2. Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary and denote by M~ its universal covering space. Then the following are equivalent: (i) 1(M) is amenable, (ii) the Steklov spectra satisfy the inclusion (M)  (M~ ), (iii) the bottom of the Steklov spectrum of M~ is zero.
It seems interesting that the topology of the boundary does not play any role in the preceding theorem, taking into account that we consider operators acting on functions defined on the boundary (which is a significant difference from the Dirichlet and the Neumann analogues of Brooks' result). For instance, the fundamental group of any boundary component may be non-amenable, while the fundamental group of the manifold
2

is amenable. Furthermore, the fundamental group of any boundary component may be amenable (or even trivial), while the fundamental group of the manifold is non-amenable.
In the third part of the paper, we consider the Steklov spectrum of total spaces of Riemannian principal bundles over compact manifolds. The notion of Riemannian submersion has been introduced in 1960s as a tool to describe the geometry of a manifold in terms of simpler components (the base space and the fibers). Hence, it is natural to express the spectrum of the total space in terms of the geometry and the spectrum of the base space and the fibers. There are various results in this direction involving compact (cf. for instance the survey [4]) or non-compact manifolds (see for example [3, 6, 21, 22]). Our discussion is motivated by the recent paper [22], which focuses on non-compact total spaces of Riemannian principal bundles (see also [7] for the compact case).
To set the stage, let G be a connected Lie group acting freely, smoothly and properly via isometries on a Riemannian manifold M2. Then the quotient M1 = M2/G is a Riemannian manifold and the projection p : M2  M1 is a Riemannian submersion. We then say that p arises from the action of G. Similarly to the case of Riemannian coverings, we are interested in how properties of G are reflected in the spectrum of M2. As indicated in [22], it is natural to compare the spectrum of the Laplacian on M2 with the spectrum of the Schro¨dinger operator

on M1, where H is the mean curvature of the fibers. More precisely, according to [22, Theorem 1.3], if M1 is compact, then G is unimodular and amenable if and only if D0 (M2) = D0 (S). It is noteworthy that if G is unimodular, then S is intertwined with the symmetric diffusion operator
L =  + pH
regarded in L2V (M1), where V is a function expressing the volume element of the fiber. If M1 is compact, then we have that D0 (L) > 0, which yields that any f  C(M1) has a unique L-harmonic extension HLf  C(M1) (that is, L(HLf ) = 0). Hence, we may consider the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map

L : C(M1)  L2V (M1)  L2V (M1), f  (HLf ).
We denote the spectrum of the Friedrichs extension of this operator by L(M1). Returning to our discussion on the Steklov spectrum, we begin by pointing out that
if p : M2  M1 is a Riemannian submersion arising from the action of a connected Lie group G, where M1 is compact, then M2 has bounded geometry and D0 (M2) > 0 (the latter one is a consequence of the recent [22, Theorem 1.1]). Therefore, we may define the Steklov spectrum of M2 as above. In this setting, we establish the following analogue of [22, Theorem 1.3].

Theorem 1.3. Let p : M2  M1 be a Riemannian submersion arising from the action of a connected Lie group G, where M1 is compact with boundary. Then the following are equivalent: (i) G is unimodular and amenable, (ii) the Steklov spectra satisfy the inclusion L(M1)  (M2), (iii) the bottom of the Steklov spectrum of M2 is zero.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we give some preliminaries involving functional analysis, the spectrum of Laplace type operators, Sobolev spaces on manifolds with bounded geometry, amenable coverings, and Lie groups. Section 3 is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.1 and the discussion of some properties of the Steklov spectrum. In Section 4, we focus on Riemannian coverings and establish an extension of Theorem 1.2. In Section 5, we study Riemannian submersions and give the proof of Theorem 1.3.

2 Preliminaries

We begin by recalling some basic facts from functional analysis, which may be found for instance in [15, 17]. Throughout this section, let H be a separable Hilbert space over R.
The spectrum of a self-adjoint operator T : D(T )  H  H is defined as

(T ) = {  R : T -  : D(T )  H  H is not bijective}.

In general, the spectrum of a self-adjoint operator does not consist only of eigenvalues, but consists of approximate eigenvalues, as the following proposition indicates.

Proposition 2.1. Let T : D(T )  H  H be a self-adjoint operator and consider   R. Then   (T ) if and only if there exists (vn)nN  D(T ) such that vn = 1 and (T - )vn  0 in H.

The infimum of (T ) is called the bottom of the spectrum of T and is denoted by

0(T ). A particularly useful expression for 0(T ) is provided by Rayleigh's theorem, which

asserts that

0(T

)

=

inf v

T v, v v2

,

where the infimum is taken over all non-zero v  D(T ). Consider now a densely-defined, symmetric linear operator T : D(T )  H  H. We
say that T is bounded from below if there exists c  R such that T v, v  c v 2 for any v  D(T ). Fix such a c and define the inner product

v, w T = T v, w + (1 - c) v, w

4

on D(T ). Denoting by HT the completion of D(T ) with respect to this inner product, it is
easy to see that the inclusion D(T ) - H extends to an injective map HT  H. Using this map, we regard HT as a subspace of H. The Friedrichs extension T F of T is the restriction of the adjoint T  to the space D(T F ) = HT  D(T ). The Friedrichs extension T F is a
self-adjoint extension of T , and Rayleigh's theorem implies the following expression for
the bottom of its spectrum.

Proposition 2.2. The bottom of the spectrum of T F is given by

0(T

where the infimum is taken over all non-zero v  D(T ).

2.1 Laplace type operators

Throughout this paper manifolds are assumed to be connected. However, their boundaries
may be non-connected. Moreover, the term "manifold with boundary" refers to a manifold
with non-empty, smooth boundary.
Let M be a Riemannian manifold with possibly empty boundary. A symmetric
Laplace type operator L on M is an operator of the form L =  - 2 grad ln  + V , where  is the Laplacian, , V  C(M) and  > 0. In the case where  = 1, L
is a Schr¨odinger operator, while L is called a diffusion operator if V = 0. Denote by L2(M) the L2-space of M with respect to the measure 2d vol, where d vol is the measure induced by the Riemannian metric. It is worth to point out that the isometric isomorphism m : L2(M)  L2(M) defined by mf = f , intertwines L with the Schro¨dinger operator

Given a non-zero f  Cc(M), set

RL(f ) =

M(

grad f 2 + V f 2)2

M f 22

.

In the case of the Laplacian (that is,  = 1 and V = 0), we denote this quantity by R(f ). If M does not have boundary, then

L : Cc(M )  L2(M )  L2(M )

is densely-defined and symmetric. If it is bounded from below, we denote by 0(L) the bottom of the spectrum of its Friedrichs extension. From Proposition 2.2 and the divergence formula, we obtain the following expression for 0(L).

5

Proposition 2.3. The bottom of the spectrum of L is given by

0(L) = inf f

Lf, f L2(M) f2
L2(M )

=

inf RL(f ), f

where the infimum is taken over all non-zero f  Cc(M).

For the rest of this subsection, suppose that M has non-empty boundary. We begin our discussion with the Dirichlet spectrum of L. The operator

L : {f  Cc(M ) : f = 0 on M }  L2(M )  L2(M )

(1)

is densely-defined and symmetric. If it is bounded from below, we denote by LD its
Friedrichs extension. It is noteworthy that if M is complete, then this operator is essentially self-adjoint (cf. for instance [2, Theorem A.24]); that is, LD is the closure of this operator and actually coincides with the adjoint of this operator. The spectrum of LD is called the Dirichlet spectrum of L. The following expression for the bottom D0 (L) of the Dirichlet spectrum is an immediate consequence of Proposition 2.2 and the divergence
formula.

Proposition 2.4. The bottom of the Dirichlet spectrum of L is given by

D0 (L)

inf f

Lf, f L2(M) f2
L2(M )

=

inf f

RL

(f

),

where the infimum is taken over all non-zero f  Cc(M) with f = 0 on M.

It is not difficult to verify that the bottom of the Dirichlet spectrum of L coincides
with the bottom of the spectrum of L considered on the interior of M. We are also interested in the Neumann spectrum of L, which is the spectrum of the
Friedrichs extension LN of the operator

L : {f  Cc(M ) : (f ) = 0 on M }  L2(M )  L2(M ),

in the case where this operator is bounded from below, where  stands for the outward pointing unit normal to M. The following expression for the bottom N0 (L) of the Neumann spectrum may be found for instance in [19, Proposition 3.2] in the case of
Schro¨dinger operators. This readily extends the to symmetric Laplace type operators, by
passing to the corresponding Schro¨dinger operator as described in the beginning of this
subsection.

Proposition 2.5. The bottom of the Neumann spectrum of L is given by

N0

(L)

inf f

RL(f

),

where the infimum is taken over all non-zero f  Cc(M).

It should be emphasized that the test functions in the preceding proposition are not
required to satisfy any boundary condition.
To simplify our notation, in the case of the Laplacian, we set 0(M) = 0(), D0 (M ) = D0 () and N0 (M ) = N0 ().

2.2 Sobolev spaces on manifolds with bounded geometry

Let M be a Riemannian manifold with boundary and  the outward pointing unit normal
to M. Denote by R the curvature tensor of M and by  the second fundamental form of M. The following definition may be found in [14, 23]1.

Definition 2.6. We say that M has bounded geometry if the following hold: (i) there exists r > 0 such that

exp : M × [0, r)  M, (x, t)  expx(-t)
is a diffeomorphism onto its image, (ii) the injectivity radius of M (as a manifold endowed with the induced Riemannian
metric) is positive, (iii) there is r0 > 0 such that for any x  M B(M, r0), the restriction of expx to
B(0, r0)  TxM is a diffeomorphism onto its image, (iv) for any k  N  {0} there exists Ck > 0 such that kR  Ck and k  Ck.
We begin our discussion on such manifolds with the following observation.

Lemma 2.7. Let M be a Riemannian manifold with boundary and bounded geometry. Then the outward pointing unit normal  to M can be extended to a bounded smooth vector field N on M with N bounded.

Proof: Denoting by dM the distance to M, using the diffeomorphism from (i), extend

 to the vector field

defined in B(M, r). It follows from standard comparison theorems (cf. for instance [8])

that there exists  > 0 such that V is bounded in B(M, ), keeping in mind that the

sectional curvature of M is bounded and so are the principal curvatures of M. Consider

now a smooth  : [0 + )  R with (x) = 1 for x  /4 and (x) = 0 for x  /2. It

is immediate to verify that N = (  dM )V is a bounded smooth vector field on M with N bounded, which coincides with  on M.

The next theorem is essentially a special version of [14, Theorem 1.1], where we point out a difference in the form of the elliptic estimates, in the case where the bottom of the Dirichlet spectrum of the Laplacian is positive.

1The definition in [14] is equivalent to the one in [23], as pointed out in [14, p. 12].

Theorem 2.8. Let M be a Riemannian manifold with boundary and bounded geometry, such that D0 (M) > 0. Then any f  D(D) belongs to H2(M). More precisely, there exists C > 0 such that
f H2(M)  C Df L2(M)
for any f  D(D).

Proof: Bearing in mind that the Laplacian on M regarded as in (1) is essentially selfadjoint, we readily see that for any f  D(D) there exists (fn)nN  Cc(M ) with fn = 0 on M such that fn  f and fn  Df in L2(M). Therefore, it suffices to establish the asserted estimate for f  Cc(M) with f = 0 on M. Indeed, this gives that (fn)nN is Cauchy in H2(M), and thus, converges to f in H2(M).
It follows from [14, Theorem 1.1] that there exists C > 0 such that

f H2(M)  C( f L2(M) + f H1(M))

for any f  Cc(M) with f = 0 on M. If, in addition, f is not identically zero, we readily see from Proposition 2.4 that

f L2(M) 

f, f L2(M) f L2(M )

= R(f )

f

L2(M)  D0 (M ) f

L2(M ).

Since D0 (M) > 0, this yields that

The proof is completed by combining the above inequalities.

We will also exploit the following trace theorem, which is a special version of [14, Theorem 3.15].

Theorem 2.9. Let M be a Riemannian manifold with boundary and bounded geometry. Then the restriction to the boundary res : Cc(M)  Cc(M) extends to a continuous res : H1(M )  L2(M ).

2.3 Amenable coverings
Consider a right action of a finitely generated discrete group  on a countable set X. We say that this action is amenable if there exists an invariant mean on (X); that is, a linear functional µ : (X)  R such that: (i) inf f  µ(f )  sup f , (ii) µ(f  rg) = µ(f ), where rg(x) = xg for any x  X,
8

for any f  (X) and g  . The group  is called amenable if the right action of  on itself is amenable. Standard
examples of amenable groups are solvable groups and groups of subexponential growth. It is not difficult to verify that if  is amenable, then any right action of  is amenable. A particularly useful characterization of amenability is the following proposition due to Følner.
Proposition 2.10. Let  be a finitely generated generated group and fix a finite, symmetric generating set G. Then the right action of  on a countable set X is amenable if and only if for any  > 0 there exists a non-empty finite subset P of X such that
|P g P | < |P |
for any g  G.
Let p : M2  M1 be a Riemannian covering and choose x  M1 as a base point for 1(M1). Given y  p-1(x) and g  1(M1), consider a representative loop  of g based at x. Lift  to a path ~ starting at y and denote its endpoint by yg. In this way, we obtain a right action of 1(M1) to p-1(x), which is called the monodromy action. We say that the covering is amenable if the monodromy action is amenable. It is worth to mention that a normal Riemannian covering is amenable if and only if its deck transformation group is amenable. In particular, the universal covering of a manifold is amenable if and only if its fundamental group is amenable.
If M1 is compact with boundary, then 1(M1) is finitely generated. More specifically, the finite and symmetric set
Sr = {g  1(M1) : g has a representative loop of length less than r}
generates 1(M1) for r > 0 sufficiently large. The next elementary lemma provides a description of the monodromy action in terms of this set.
Lemma 2.11. Given y1, y2  p-1(x), there exists g  Sr such that y2 = y1g if and only if d(y1, y2) < r.
Proof: Suppose that y2 = y1g for some g  Sr. Then there exists a representative loop  of g based at x of length less than r. Since the endpoint of its lift starting at y1 is y2, it is clear that d(y1, y2) < r. Conversely, if d(y1, y2) < r, consider a curve c from y1 to y2 of length less than r. Denoting by g the class of p  c in 1(M1), we readily see that y2 = y1g and g  Sr, p  c having length less than r.
Amenability of a covering is intertwined with the preservation of the bottom of the spectrum, as Brooks' result illustrates. In the sequel, we will exploit the corresponding result involving the bottom of the Neumann spectrum.
Theorem 2.12 ([19, Theorem 1.1]). Let p : M2  M1 be a Riemannian covering, where M1 is compact with boundary. Then p is amenable if and only if N0 (M2) = 0.
9

2.4 Lie groups
A connected Lie group G is called amenable if there exists a left-invariant mean on L(G); that is a linear functional µ : L(G)  R such that (i) ess inf f  µ(f )  ess sup f , (ii) µ(f  Lx) = µ(f ), for any f  L(G) and x  G, where Lx : G  G stands for multiplication from the left with x  G. Here, we consider L(G) with respect to the Haar measure of G, which is just a constant multiple of the volume element of G induced by a left-invariant metric. For more details, see [13]. It is well-known that a connected Lie group G is amenable if and only if it is a compact extension of a solvable group (cf. for example [18, Lemma 2.2]).
A Lie group G is called unimodular if its Haar measure is right-invariant. It is noteworthy that a connected Lie group G is unimodular if and only if tr(ad X) = 0 for any X in the Lie algebra of G (cf. for instance [16, Proposition 1.2]). Standard examples of unimodular and amenable Lie groups are connected, nilpotent Lie groups.
Even thought the above properties are group theoretic, they are reflected in the spectrum of the Laplacian. The following characterization has been established for simply connected Lie groups in [16, Theorem 3.8], and extended to connected Lie groups in [20, Theorem 2.10].
Theorem 2.13. A connected Lie group G is unimodular and amenable if and only if 0(G) = 0 for some/any left-invariant metric on G.
3 The Steklov spectrum of manifolds with bounded geometry
In this section, we define the Steklov spectrum of manifolds satisfying the assumptions of Theorem 1.1, and discuss some basic properties of it. Throughout this section, we consider a Riemannian manifold M with boundary and bounded geometry such that D0 (M) > 0, and we denote by  the outward pointing unit normal to M.
Proposition 3.1. Any f  Cc(M) has a unique square-integrable harmonic extension Hf  C(M). In addition, this extension is written as Hf = f + h, where f  Cc(M) is an extension of f and h  D(D).
Proof: Let f  Cc(M) and consider an extension f  Cc(M) of it. The assumption that D0 (M ) > 0 means that
D : D(D)  L2(M )  L2(M )
is bijective. In particular, there exists h  D(D) such that Dh = -f . Bearing in mind that f  C(M), we derive from elliptic regularity that h  C(M) with h = 0 on
10

M, and h = -f . It is evident that h + f is a square-integrable harmonic extension
of f . Let f1, f2  C(M) be square-integrable harmonic extensions of a given f  Cc(M).
Then h = f1 -f2  C(M )  L2(M ) is harmonic and vanishes on M . Given g  Cc(M ) with g = 0 on M, we compute

h, g L2(M) =

grad h, grad g - h(g) =

(h)g = 0,

M

M

M

where we used that h is harmonic. This shows that h  D() with h = 0. Since
M is complete, the Laplacian  regarded as in (1) is essentially self-adjoint, and hence,  = D. We deduce that h belongs to the kernel of D and thus, h = 0, due to the fact that D0 (M ) > 0.

Proposition 3.2. For any f  Cc(M) we have that Hf  H2(M). Moreover, there exists a sequence (fn)nN  Cc(M ), consisting of extensions of f , such that fn  Hf in H2(M ).

Proof: Given f  Cc(M), it follows from Proposition 3.1 that Hf = f + h, for some extension f  Cc(M) of f and h  D(D). Since the Laplacian on M regarded as in (1) is essentially self-adjoint, we readily see that there exists (hn)nN  Cc(M ) with hn = 0 on M, such that hn  h and hn  h in L2(M). Then Theorem 2.8 yields that hn  h in H2(M ). Therefore, fn = f + hn  Cc(M ) is an extension of f and fn  Hf in H2(M ).

Proof of Theorem 1.1: We know from Propositions 3.1 and 3.2 that any f  Cc(M) admits a unique square-integrable harmonic extension Hf  H2(M). In view of Lemma 2.7, we may extend  to a bounded smooth vector field N on M with N bounded. Then we have that N(Hf )  H1(M), and its restriction (Hf ) to the boundary is square-
integrable, by virtue of Theorem 2.9.

It is now clear that the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map

 : Cc(M )  L2(M )  L2(M ), f  (Hf )

is well-defined. It is also evident that this linear operator is densely-defined.

Lemma 3.3. For any f, h  Cc(M), we have that

f, h L2(M) = f, h L2(M) =

grad(Hf ), grad(Hh) .

M

Proof: For any extension f  Cc(M) of f , we derive from the divergence formula that

f, h L2(M) =

grad f, grad(Hh) .

M

The proof is completed by Proposition 3.2, which asserts that there exists a sequence (fn)nN of such extensions satisfying fn  Hf in H2(M ).

11

Hence, aforementioned Dirichlet-to-Neumann map admits Friedrichs extension, being symmetric and bounded from below by zero. The spectrum (M) of its Friedrichs extension is called the Steklov spectrum of M, and its bottom is denoted by 0(M).

Proposition 3.4. The bottom of the Steklov spectrum of M is given by

0(M )

=

inf f

M

grad f 2

where the infimum is taken over all f  Cc(M) which are not identically zero on M.

Before proceeding to the proof of this proposition, we need the following remark.

Proof: Since Hf - f = h  H01(M ), there exists (hn)nN  Cc(M ) with hn = 0 on M , such that hn  h in H1(M). It is immediate to verify that

which establishes the asserted inequality.

From the proof, it is clear that the equality in the preceding lemma holds if and only if M is compact and f = Hf .

Proof of Proposition 3.4: We know from Proposition 2.2 and Lemma 3.3 that

0(M ) = inf f

where the infimum is taken over all non-zero f  Cc(M). This is less or equal to the asserted infimum, by virtue of Lemma 3.5. The equality follows from Proposition 3.2, according to which, the square-integrable harmonic extension can be approximated in H2(M) by compactly supported smooth extensions.
A straightforward consequence of Proposition 3.4 is the following relation between the bottom of the Steklov and the Neumann spectrum.

Theorem 3.6. If 0(M) = 0, then N0 (M) = 0.

12

Proof: We readily see from Proposition 3.4 that there exists (fn)nN  Cc(M) such that fn L2(M) = 1 and
grad fn 2  0.
M
Assume to the contrary that N0 (M) > 0. Then Proposition 2.5 implies that

fn

N0 (M )-1

grad fn 2  0.

M

This means that fn  0 in H1(M) and thus, fn  0 in L2(M), by virtue of Theorem 2.9, which is a contradiction.

Recall that according to Proposition 2.1, the spectrum of a self-adjoint operator consists of the approximate eigenvalues of the operator. In general, given f  Cc(M) and   R, it may be quite complicated to estimate the quantity f - f L2(M). The next observation allows us to substitute the harmonic extension with any compactly
supported smooth extension, and the error term is controlled in terms of the Laplacian
of the chosen extension.

Proposition 3.7. There exists C > 0 such that

f - f L2(M)  (f ) - f L2(M) + C f L2(M)
for any extension f  Cc(M ) of any f  Cc(M ).
Proof: Let f  Cc(M) be an extension of a given f  Cc(M). Extending  to a bounded smooth vector field N on M with N bounded (as in Lemma 2.7), we obtain from Theorem 2.9 that there exists C1 > 0 such that
(f ) - (Hf ) L2(M)  C1 N (f ) - N (Hf ) H1(M)  C1C2 f - Hf H2(M),
where C2 is a constant depending on N. In view of Proposition 3.1, it is apparent that f - HF  D(D). Therefore, we derive from Theorem 2.8 that there exists C3 > 0 such that
f - Hf H2(M)  C3 (f - Hf ) L2(M) = C3 f L2(M).
We conclude that

f - f L2(M)  

(f ) - f L2(M) + (f ) - (Hf ) L2(M) (f ) - f L2(M) + C1C2C3 f L2(M),

as we wished.

4 Steklov spectrum under Riemannian coverings
Throughout this section, we consider a Riemannian covering p : M2  M1 where M1 is compact with boundary. It is not difficult to verify that M2 has bounded geometry. Indeed, it is easily checked that properties (ii)-(iv) of Definition 2.6 are satisfied, after noticing that B(M2, r) = p-1(B(M1, r)) for any r > 0, while the validity of (i) is explained for instance in [19, Lemma 4.2]. It is also important for our discussion that D0 (M2) > 0. This follows from [1, Theorem 1.3], keeping in mind that D0 (M2) coincides with the bottom of the spectrum of the Laplacian on the interior of M2. Hence, we may define the Steklov spectrum of M2 as in the previous section. The aim of this section is to establish the following extension of Theorem 1.2.
Theorem 4.1. Let p : M2  M1 be a Riemannian covering, where M1 is compact with boundary. Then the following are equivalent: (i) p is amenable, (ii) the Steklov spectra satisfy the inclusion (M1)  (M2), (iii) the bottom of the Steklov spectrum is preserved; that is, 0(M2) = 0.
Let M~ be the universal covering space of M1, consider the Riemannian coverings pi : M~  Mi, and denote by i the deck transformation group of pi, i = 1, 2. It should be noticed that p  p2 = p1.
We begin by introducing the fundamental domains that will be used in the sequel. It is worth to point out that the Dirichlet fundamental domains used in [1, 20] cannot be exploited in our setting, since we have to deal with integrals over the boundary.
Fix a finite, smooth triangulation of M1 that induces a triangulation of M1, and for each full-dimensional simplex choose a lift on M~ , so that the union F of their images is connected. The set F is called a finite sided fundamental domain of the covering p1. We readily see that Vol(F ) = Area(M~  F ) = 0 and the translates gF of F with g  1 cover M~ . Here, F stands for the boundary of F as a subset of M~ , and similarly below. It is also immediate to verify that

(f  p1) = f and

(f  p1) =

f

F

M1

M~ F

M1

for any f  C(M1). Choose x~  F  and set x = p1(x~). Given y  p-1(x), there exists g  1 such that
gx~  p-2 1(y). Set Fy = p2(gF ) and observe that it does not depend on the choice of g, since if gx~  p-2 1(y) for some g  1, then gg-1  2. It is evident that the domains Fy with y  p-1(x) cover M2 and diam(Fy)  diam(F ) for any y  p-1(x). It is not hard to check that Fy  p2(gF ), which implies that Vol(Fy) = Area(M2  Fy) = 0. From the fact that p1 : gF  M1 and p1 : M~  F  M1 are isometries up to sets of measure zero, we readily see that so are the restrictions p : Fy  M1 and p : M2  F  M1 for

14

any y  p-1(x). This yields that

(f  p) = f and

(f  p) = f

(2)

for any f  C(M1) and y  p-1(x). For any y, z  p-1(x) with y = z, using that Fy  Fz  Fy, we derive that

Vol(Fy  Fz) = Area(M2  Fy  Fz) = 0.

(3)

We now construct a partition of unity on M2, which will be used to obtain cut-off functions. To this end, we will exploit the following.

Lemma 4.2. Given r > 0, there exists k(r)  N such that for any z  M2 the open ball B(z, 1) intersects at most k(r) of the closed balls C(y, r) with y  p-1(x).

Proof: Suppose that B(z, 1) intersects the closed balls C(yi, r) with yi  p-1(x) pairwise different and let i be a minimizing geodesic from z to yi, i = 1, . . . , k. Then the concatenations (p  i)  (p  1-1) are pairwise non-homotopic loops based at x of length less than 2r + 2. We conclude that k  |S2r+2|.
Consider r > 0 such that F  B(x~, r) and Sr generates 1(M1). Fix a non-negative   Cc(M~ ) with  = 1 in B(x~, r) and supp   B(x~, r + 1). Given y  p-1(x), choose g  1 such that gx~  p-2 1(y) and set

y(z) =

(  g-1)(w) = (  g-1  g)(w0),

(4)

wp-2 1(z)

g2

for some fixed w0  p-2 1(z). Since  is compactly supported, we readily see that y is well-defined, smooth, non-negative, y  1 in B(y, r) and supp y  B(y, r+1). It follows from Lemma 4.2 (applied to the universal covering p1) that there exists k~  N such that locally at most k~ terms in the right-hand side of (4) are non-zero. Thus, we deduce that
there exists C1 > 0 such that

grad y  C1 and |y|  C1
for any y  p-1(x). According to Lemma 4.2, there exists k  N such that at most k of the supports of
y with y  p-1(x) intersect any ball of radius one in M2. Therefore, the function

=

y

yp-1 (x)

is well-defined, smooth, and greater or equal to one. Moreover, we obtain that , grad  and  are bounded.

15

Consider now the smooth partition of unity on M2 consisting of the functions

y

=

y 

,

with y  p-1(x). It is clear that supp y  B(y, r + 1), y > 0 in B(y, r), while grad y and y are uniformly bounded for all y  p-1(x). Given a finite subset P of p-1(x),
define the function P  Cc(M2) by

and the sets

P = y
yP

Q+ = {y  p-1(x) :  = 1 in Fy}, Q- = {y  p-1(x) : 0 < (z) < 1 for some z  Fy}.

Since at most k of the supports of y interest any ball of radius one in M2, it is easy to see that exists C2 > 0 such that

grad P  C2 and |P |  C2

(5)

for any finite subset P of p-1(x). Furthermore, the sets Q+ and Q- are finite, P being compactly supported
The following proposition illustrates how amenability of the covering is related to our construction.

Proposition 4.3. If p : M2  M1 is amenable, then for any  > 0 there exists a finite subset P of p-1(x) such that |Q-| < |Q+|.
Proof: Set d = 2(r + 1 + diam(F )). We know from Proposition 2.10 that for any  > 0 there exists a non-empty, finite subset P of p-1(x) such that

|P g P | < |P |

for any g  Sd. Consider the corresponding function P and let y  P such that yg  P for any g  Sd. Let z  Fy and y  p-1(x) such that z  supp y. Then d(z, y) < r + 1 and thus, d(y, y) < d/2, because diam(Fy)  diam(F ). Lemma 2.11 shows that there exists g  Sd such that y = yg  P . Since {y}yp-1(x) is a partition of unity on M2, we
deduce that y  Q+. This yields that

|P  (gSd P g)|  |Q+|,

and thus,

|Q+|  |P | - | gSd (P P g)|  (1 - |Sd|)|P |,

16

where we used that Sd is symmetric. Consider now y  Q- and z  Fy such that 0 < P (z) < 1. Then there exist y1  P
and y2  p-1(x) P such that i(z) > 0, i = 1, 2. This implies that d(z, yi) < r + 1, and hence, d(y, yi) < d/2, i = 1, 2. In particular, we obtain that d(y1, y2) < d and there exists g  Sd such that y1 = y2g  P P g, in view of Lemma 2.11. Since d(y, y1) < d/2, we derive from Lemma 2.11 that for such a y there exists at most |Sd/2| such y1. This gives the estimate
|Q-|  |Sd/2||P P g| < |Sd/2||Sd||P |.
gSd
Combining the above, for  > 0 sufficiently small, we conclude that

|Q-| |Q+|

<

|Sd/2||Sd| 1 - |Sd|

,

which completes the proof.
Proof of Theorem 4.1: Suppose first that the covering p : M2  M1 is amenable. Since M1 is compact, its Steklov spectrum is discrete. Therefore, for any   (M1), there exists a harmonic f  C(M1) with f L2(M1) = 1 such that 1(f ) = f on M1, where 1 is the outward pointing unit normal to M1. Denote by f~ = f  p the lift of f on M2 and, given a a non-empty, finite subset P of p-1(x), consider the function fP = P f~  Cc(M2).
For y  Q+, keeping in mind (2) and that fP = f~ in Fy, we readily see that

(fP )2 = 0,

(2(fP ) - fP )2 = 0 and

fP2 = 1,

where 2 is the outward pointing unit normal to M2. Fix now y  Q-. Using (2) and that f~ is harmonic, we compute

Since the constants involved in these estimates are independent from P , it follows from Proposition 4.3 that for any  > 0 there exists a finite subset P of p-1(x) such that

We conclude from Proposition 2.1 that   (M2),  > 0 being arbitrary.
It is clear from Proposition 3.4 that 0(M2)  0. Therefore, if (M1)  (M2), then
0(M2) = 0, because 0(M1) = 0. Suppose now that 0(M2) = 0. Then Theorem 3.6 states that N0 (M2) = 0, and thus, the covering is amenable, in view of Theorem 2.12.

5 Steklov spectrum under Riemannian submersions
The aim of this section is to establish Theorem 1.3. Throughout, we consider a Riemannian submersion p : M2  M1 arising from the action of a connected Lie group G, where M1 is compact with boundary, and denote by i the outward pointing unit normal to Mi, i = 1, 2. For more details on Riemannian submersions, see [9, 11]. We begin by showing that M2 has bounded geometry and D0 (M2) > 0.
Proposition 5.1. In the aforementioned setting, M2 has bounded geometry.
Proof: Bearing in mind that G acts on M2 via isometries, it is easy to verify properties (ii)-(iv) of Definition 2.6, after noticing that B(M2, r) = p-1(B(M1, r)) for any r > 0. To check the validity of (i), observe that there exists r > 0 such that the map
exp : M1 × [0, r)  M1, (y, t)  expy(-t1)
is a diffeomorphism onto its image, M1 being compact. Choose a precompact, open U  M2 such that GU = M2, and consider r  r such that
exp : U × [0, r)  M2, (z, t)  expz(-t2)
18

is a diffeomorphism onto its image. Since G acts on M2 via isometries, we derive that

exp : M2 × [0, r)  M2, (z, t)  expz(-t2)

is a local diffeomorphism onto its image. Hence, it remains to show that this map is injective.
To this end, let z1, z2  M2 and t1, t2  [0, r) with expz1(-t12) = expz2(-t22) = z. From the fact that i(t) = expzi(-t2) is a horizontal geodesic, we readily see that (p  i)(t) = expp(zi)(-t1), i = 1, 2. Since r  r, this yields that p(z1) = p(z2) and t1 = t2. In particular, the geodesics p  i coincide, and hence, so do their horizontal lifts i with endpoint z. We conclude that z1 = z2 and t1 = t2, as we wished.
Consider the Schro¨dinger operator

on M1. We know from [22, Theorem 1.1] that D0 (M2)  D0 (S). It is worth to mention that [22, Theorem 1.1] is formulated for manifolds without boundary, which however
do not have to be complete. Hence, the assertion is readily extends to manifolds with
boundary.

Proposition 5.2. In the aforementioned setting, we have that D0 (S) > 0.

Proof: Given a non-zero f  Cc(M1) with f = 0 on M1, we compute

where we used the divergence formula. In particular, we deduce that RS(f )  0 for any such f , which means that D0 (S)  0, in view of Proposition 2.4.
Assume to the contrary that D0 (S) = 0. Since M1 is compact, the Dirichlet spectrum of S is discrete. This yields that there exists f  C(M1) positive in M1 and vanishing on M1 such that Sf = 0, which implies that RS(f ) = 0. From the preceding computation, we conclude that
pH = -2 grad ln f
in M1. This is a contradiction, since pH is smooth on M1, while f vanishes on M1.
From the above, it follows that M2 has bounded geometry and D0 (M2) > 0. Therefore, we may define the Steklov spectrum of M2 as in Section 3.

19

The proof of Theorem 1.3 relies on the methods of [22]. For convenience of the reader,
we briefly discuss what will be used in the sequel. Given a section s : U  M1  M2, the map  : G × U  p-1(U) defined by (x, y) = xs(y) is a diffeomorphism. We denote by gs(y) the pullback of the Riemannian metric of the fiber Fy = p-1(y) via (·, y). Then gs(y) is a left-invariant metric depending smoothly on y  U, according to [22, Proposition 4.1]. The behavior of the volume elements of these metrics is illustrated in the following.

Proposition 5.3 ([22, Corollaries 4.2 and 4.3]). Let g be a fixed left-invariant metric on G. Given a section s : U  M1  M2, there exists Vs  C(U ) such that the volume elements are related by
dvolgs(y) = Vs(y)dvolg.
If, in addition, G is unimodular, then there exists V  C(M) such that

dvolgs(y) = V (y)dvolg

for any section s : U  M1  M2 and y  U. Moreover, the gradient of V is given by grad V = -V pH.

In the case where G is unimodular, it follows that the Schro¨dinger operator defined

in (6) is written as

 S =  -  V ,
V

and therefore, corresponds to the symmetric diffusion operator

 L = m-1  S  m =  - 2 grad ln V =  + pH.

It is noteworthy that

(f  p) = (Lf )  p

(7)

for any f  C(M1) (cf. for instance [22, Lemma 2.6]). Moreover, since the Dirichlet
spectra of S and L coincide (m being an isometric isomorphism), we derive from Proposition 5.2 that D0 (L) > 0. Hence, any f  C(M1) admits a unique L-harmonic extension HLf  C(M1). This gives rise to the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map

L : C(M1)  L2V (M1)  L2V (M1), f  (HLf ).

It is standard that the spectrum L(M1) of the Friedrichs extension of this map is discrete and the corresponding eigenfunctions are smooth.
Given a section s : U  M1  M2 and f : G  R, we denote by fs : p-1(U )  R the function satisfying
fs((x, y)) = f (x)
for any x  G and y  U.

20

Proposition 5.4 ([22, Lemma 4.6 and Proposition 4.7]). Fix a left-invariant metric on
G. Then for any r > 0 and any bounded, open W  G, there exists   Cc(G) with  = 1 in W B(W, r), supp   B(W, r/2), such that for any extensible section s : U  M2, there exists C > 0 independent from W , satisfying

for any z  p-1(U ).

|(s)(z)|  C and grad(s)(z)  C

The point of this proposition is that the constant depends only on the section, and not on the corresponding W . These functions are obtained from a partition of unity which is constructed by translates of a fixed function (conceptually related to the partition of unity of the previous section). The importance of this construction becomes more clear in the following consequence of Theorem 2.13, together with the Cheeger and Buser inequalities (more precisely, the main ingredient in the proof of the latter one).

Proposition 5.5 ([22, Corollary 2.11]). Suppose that G is non-compact, unimodular and amenable, and choose a left-invariant metric on it. Then for any  > 0 and r > 0, there exists a bounded, open W  G such that

|B(W, r)| < |W B(W, r)|.

The most technical part of the proof of Theorem 1.3 is contained in the following.

Proposition 5.6. If G is unimodular and amenable, then for any   L(M1) and  > 0, there exists h  Cc(M2) such that ( - )h L2(M2) <  h . L2(M2)

Proof: Since M1 is compact, for any   L(M1), there exists f  C(M1) with

f

Lf

If

G

is

compact,

it

is

immediate

to verify that its lift f~ = f  p is harmonic and satisfies 2(f~) = f~ on M2, by virtue of

(7). Hence, it remains to prove the assertion in the case where G is non-compact.

To this end, cover M1 with finitely many open domains Ui that admit extensible sections si : Ui  M1  M2, i = 1, . . . , k, and consider a smooth partition of unity {i}1ik subordinate to {Ui}1ik. Denote by xij : Ui  Uj  G the transition maps, which are defined by sj(y) = xij(y)si(y) for all y  Ui  Uj, and by i : G × Ui  p-1(Ui) the diffeomorphisms defined by i(x, y) = xsi(y), i, j = 1, . . . , k.
Choose a left-invariant metric g on G. Using that Ui is precompact and si is extensible, we readily see that there exists r > 0 such that xij(Ui  Uj)  Bg(e, r) for any i, j = 1, . . . , k, where e is the neutral element of G. Given a bounded, open W  G,

denote by  the corresponding function, according to Proposition 5.4, for r as above,

where we regard G endowed with the fixed Riemannian metric g. Consider the compactly

supported, smooth function

hi := si~if~

from

Proposition 5.4, that there exists Cf > 0 independent from W , such that |h(z)|  Cf ,

grad h(z)  Cf and |h(z)|  Cf for any z  M2. It follows from Proposition 5.5 that

there exists a bounded, open W  G such that

where W0 = B(W, 3r), W0 = W W0, and C is the constant from Proposition 3.7 on M2. To simplify the notation, set D0 = W C(W, 2r), D0 = C(W, 2r), and given y  Ui, let Wi(y) = i(W0, y), Wi(y) = i(W0, y), Di(y) = i(D0, y) and Di(y) = i(D0 , y), i = 1, . . . , k. Here, B(·, ·) and C(·, ·) stand for open and closed tubular neighborhoods
with respect to the fixed Riemannian metric g, respectively. Using that

i(x, y) = j(xxji(y), y)
for any y  Ui  Uj and x  G, it is immediate to verify that h(z) = f~(z) for any z  Di(y)  Wi(y) and that supp h  Fy  Di(y)  Di(y)  Wi(y)  Wi(y) for any y  Ui, i = 1, . . . , k.

To estimate these quantities, recall that D0 is an open subset of G, and hence, so is i(D0 × Ui)  M2, which is a neighborhood of Wi(y) for any y  Ui  M1, i = 1, . . . , k. Since h = f~ in i(D0 × Ui), in Wi(y) we have that

2(h) = 2(f~) = 2, grad f~ = 1, grad f  p = f~ = h,

22

and thus, Q1 = 0. In Wi(y), using Proposition 5.3 and that (2(h) - h)2  2Cf2(2 + 1), we readily see that

Another important ingredient in the proof of Theorem 1.3 involves the behavior of the Neumann spectrum under Riemannian submersions. One can establish the following by arguing as in [22]. However, in our setting, where the base manifold is compact, we can prove it in a simpler way (which also establishes the analogous assertion if the base manifold is closed).

Theorem 5.7. If N0 (M2) = 0, then G is unimodular and amenable.
Proof: Cover M1 with finitely many open domains Ui admitting extensible sections si : Ui  M1  M2, and denote by i,y : G  Fy the diffeomorphism i,y(x) = xsi(y) with y  Ui, i = 1, . . . , k. Let {i}1ik be a smooth partition of unity subordinate to {Ui}1ik. Fix a left-invariant Riemannian metric g on G and consider the functions Vsi  C(Ui) from Proposition 5.3. Since si is extensible, it follows that there exists c > 0 such that
gradgsi(y)f  c gsi(y) gradgf g

for any f  C(G) and y  Ui, i = 1, . . . , k. Since N0 (M2) = 0, we obtain from Proposition 2.5 that for any  > 0 there exists a

where (grad f )v stands for the vertical component of grad f , and the integrals over G are with respect to the fixed Riemannian metric g. It is now clear that there exists 1  i  k and y  Ui such that i(y) > 0, f is not identically zero on Fy, and we have that

Since  > 0 is arbitrary, we conclude from Proposition 2.3 that 0(G, g) = 0, and therefore, G is unimodular and amenable, by Theorem 2.13.

Proof of Theorem 1.3: If G is unimodular and amenable, then L(M1)  (M2) by
virtue of Propositions 2.1 and 5.6. Taking into account that 0  L(M1), it evident that
the second statement implies the third. Finally, if 0(M2) = 0, then we derive from Theorem 3.6 that N0 (M2) = 0, and hence G is unimodular and amenable, in view of Theorem 5.7.
