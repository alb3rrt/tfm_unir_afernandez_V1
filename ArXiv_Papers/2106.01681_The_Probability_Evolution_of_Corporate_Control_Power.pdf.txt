The Probability Evolution of Corporate Control Power *

Abstract How does the control power of corporate top1 shareholder arise? On the fundamental economics principle, we discover that the probability of top1 shareholder possessing optimal control power evolves in Fibonacci series pattern and emerges as a wave between 0.500 and 0.667 along with time in period of 12h (h is the time distance between the state and state of the evolution). This novel feature suggests the efficiency of the allocation of corporate shareholders' right and power. Data on the Chinese stock market support this prediction.

1. Introduction Corporate shareholder has a pair of matching rights: residual claimancy (cash flow right) and residual right of control/control right (voting right; Alchian and Demsetz 1972; Grossman and Hart 1986; Hart and Moore 1990; Milgrom and Roberts 1992). Many previous works have contributed to the empirical correlation between this pair of rights and corporate behaviors/performance (La Porta et al. 1999; Claessens et al. 2000; Faccio and Lang 2002; Claessens et al. 2002; Lemmon and Lins 2003; Lin et al. 2013).
However, from the perspective of corporate shareholder, the exercise of voting right lies with the comparative advantage of one's voting right over the right of others rather than the absolute amount of the voting right itself. It depends not only on the amount of one's voting right itself but also that of others. It is endogenous from the competition among shareholders. That is, it is exactly "power" rather than "right". We define it as "control power" corresponding to "control right". No matter in logic or actuality, "control power" is the primary concept and "control right" is derivative (aroused) though the former is invisible, and the latter is concrete. It is the shareholder's control power, not control right, that directly dominates corporate behaviors/performance. For understanding corporate behaviors/performance, control power is more simply and more substantive than control right.
Several prior works have chosen the Shapley-Shubik power index (  [0,1]; Shapley and Shubik 1954) as an alternative for voting right to improve the measurement of control right (e.g., Nenova 2003; Edwards and Weichenrieder 2009; Andres et al. 2013; Aminadav and Papaioannou 2020). However,  is an instrument to measure power, and control right should only be measured by voting right exactly.
In the endogeny of corporate shareholder's control power, it is critical to understand the dynamics. Unfortunately, a complete theoretical model that specifies how control power arises is still largely missing. Hence, we present a framework that quantifies how control power is determined and emerge explicitly.

2. Theoretic framework and testable hypotheses

For a corporate top1 shareholder, we could have

 =  - ,

(1)

where,  is the top1 shareholder's control power,  is the profit of ,  is the revenue of , and

 is the cost of .

Moreover, we could have

 =  + ,

(2)

where,  is the share proportion of the top1 shareholder,  indicates the efforts the top1

shareholder must make to communicate with other shareholders (to affect and prevail on them so

they give up the challenge/struggle for control power),  is the opportunity cost of having shares , and  is the negative utility by .
Further, along with the increasing , / (/) could present a decrease (increase) by degrees (by the law of diminishing marginal effect). Given that  is unchanged,  and  could

substitute for each other (see Figure 1)

Figure 1. Substitution of  and  for each other. Along with the decrease in  , / presents an increase by degrees. Meanwhile, / presents the decrease by degrees, where,  indicates the efforts the top1 shareholder able to make to communicate with other shareholders. To maximize  , the top1 shareholder takes control power  to ensure the following (see
3

Figure 2):

/ = /.

(3)

The corresponding  is then determined.

Figure 2. Top1 shareholder maximizing his profit at / = /. Of his entrepreneurship, top1 shareholder would be most sensitive to the positive utility of

control power, and least sensitive to the negative utility of efforts to negotiate and coordinate with other shareholders. Accordingly, we predict that  will be 1 with the highest probability (see

Figure 2).

Further, to obtain full identification with his entrepreneurial talent from other shareholders,

the top1 shareholder will take  to ensure the following (see Figure 3):

/ = /.

(4)

The economic implication of this is that, by convincing other shareholders to give up the

competition for control power (to transfer of their right), top1 shareholder that has greater

entrepreneurial talent could stake (pledge) less to win optimal control power (see Figure 3). That is, generallyto win optimal control powerthe greater the comparative advantage of

entrepreneurial talent over other shareholders the top1 shareholder has, the less the comparative

advantage of share rate over other shareholders the top1 shareholder can get. This indicates the

efficiency of the allocation of right and power among corporate shareholders.

Figure 3. Top1 shareholder obtaining full identification with his entrepreneurial talent from other shareholders at / = /.
However, top1 shareholder cannot calculate  exactly. What he could do is just to explore, to try his best to prevail on the other shareholders and to adjust shares/efforts ceaselessly. So, would he or would not he gain the control power ? The probability is 1/2. When he loses , he would do his best to gain . This means that the probability of the transforming from not having  into having  is 1. It is the intrinsic dynamics of the evolution of the probability of top1 shareholder obtaining . This is equivalent to the model of Fibonacci series.
In Fibonacci series model, a pair of adult rabbits always reproduces a pair of infants, and the pair of infants always grows into a pair of adults. This describes the evolution of the ratio of adults in an animal population. It is equivalent that every individual's probability of being an adult or infant is 1/2, and the probability of an infant transforming into an adult is 1. This dynamics is not only sufficient but also necessary for the adults to have the highest ratio in the population.
Therefore, we can deduce that the probability of top1 shareholder obtaining  evolves in Fibonacci series pattern: 0.500-0.667-0.600-0.625-0.615-  0.618-  . However, by random impacts of many types of uncertainties (destabilizing effects)this process would probably be stopped in any one of these states, and then starts from 0.500 again in the same pattern. Since the difference between 0.615 and 0.619-0.617...0.618... -the converging series is so tiny that it is
5

indistinguishable. So the evolution process becomes a random combination of 0.500-0.667,

0.500-0.667-0.600, 0.500-0.667-0.600-0.625, and 0.500-0.667-0.600-0.625-0.615. It is a random

linear superposition of four oscillations between 0.500 and 0.667 in period of 1, 2, 3, and 4 steps

respectively. This is equivalent to a simple harmonic oscillation between 0.500 and 0.667 in

period of 12 (the least common multiple of 1, 2, 3, and 4) steps.

Then, we could have

 =   ,

(5)

where,  is the time;  is the number of the steps in the evolution process;  is the time distance

between the state and the state of the evolution, which is a random variable.

Thus, we could derive that the probability of top1 shareholder getting  waves between 0.500

and 0.667 along with time in period of 12. This is universal.

Hence, we infer the testable hypotheses as follows:

1. In the sample of companies in which the top1 shareholder's optimal choice is , the ratio of companies of top1 shareholder having obtained control power  (=) could be fitted by Fourier function in the first order on  with a maximum 0.667 and minimum 0.500, in period of

12.

 and  could substitute for each other, and their effects would appear as the change in the top2-10 shareholders' share rates. When  is high, for the top2-10 shareholders, it would be too difficult to challenge and they have to give it up. When  is low, then  is high. Therefore, when  or  is at the maximum, the top2-10 shareholders' share rate would be minimum. So, for the sample, we propose the following:

2. Mean of the top1 shareholder's share rate (1) could be fitted by Fourier function in

the first order on  in the period double that of =, 24. 2. Mean of the top2-10 shareholders' share rate (2-10) could be fitted by Fourier
function in the first order on  in the same frequency as that of = but with phase position difference .

3. Methodology 3.1 Measurement of shareholder's control power The  (  [0,1]) was defined as the ratio of counts of a shareholder being a pivotal voter ("being critical to the success of a winning coalition" / "turning a possible defeat into a success"; Shapley and Shubik 1954) to the number of all possible combinations (coalitions) of competitors for the power. Economically, this indicates the probability of a shareholder being the last decision-maker in all competitor coalitions. That is exactly what we want to describe for shareholders' control power. We use  to measure it.
3.1.1 Calculation of the . We use the program ssdirect3 developed by Dennis Leech (University of Warwick) and Robert Leech (Imperial College London) to calculate the shareholders' .
3.1.2 Voting rule. In the Chinese stock market, the "one share one vote" rule is applicable. In shareholders' meeting (the highest authority), by the half-win ( 1/2 ) principle, the board directors, members of the top decision-making body (top power body), are elected. Therefore, we take it as the voting rule to compute the shareholders' .
3.1.3 Which shareholders are scrambling for control power? In a company, shareholders' meeting is the supreme authority institution. The shareholders decide fundamental issues through voting in it. As shown in Table 1, for the companies on main board in the Chinese stock market, from 2000 to 2019, the mean of the ratio of the share rate being present in shareholders' meeting to the share rate of top10 shareholders is rather close to 1.0. Further, the ratio of companies with top1 shareholder's  = 1 playing in top9, top10, top11 shareholders is rather close. So, we would consider that, in the Chinese stock market, shareholders' meeting is conducted almost with the top10 shareholders.

All data for this study are derived from the database of the China Stock Market and Accounting Research. 3.3 Grouping of the natural experiments The Chinese stock market comprises private-owned and state-owned companies in the main board (listed established companies) as well as the small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) board and growth enterprises market (GEM) board (listed start-ups). The government interferes in and restricts state-owned shareholders' decisions on adding/reducing shares4. However, it is difficult for the government to restrict private-owned shareholders' behaviors. Compared with the main board, in the SME and the GEM boards, due to fewer listing requirements and less regulation/supervision5 , there is widespread financial fraud in the initial public offering of the

start-ups (with great uncertainty regarding future profit), so the shareholders (especially venture

capitalists) reduce their shares largely out of normal profit thinking (Liu and Zhao 2011; Jia

2017; He 2019). Thus, we take private-owned companies on the main board as the control group

and focus on them by considering them to be normal firms in a normal market. Moreover, we

take state-owned companies on the main board as well as state-owned and private-owned

companies on the SME and GEM boards as the natural experiment groups in contrast.

3.4 Optimal control power of top1 shareholder

We can understand the choice of top1 shareholder's optimal control power by the distribution of

 value.

We find that the distribution of top1 shareholder's  is not normal but rather nearly power-

law. In about 46­66% of the private-owned companies on the main board, the top1 shareholder's

 = 1 (Table 2). This implies that top1 shareholder's own choice is more likely to be  = 1.

Notes: =1-number of companies with the top1 shareholder's  = 1. Further, we find normal distribution ( (0.467, 0.1662) ) in the sample of private-owned

firms on the main board with the top1 shareholder's control power  < 1 (Table 3). This

normal distribution is robust and independent of the ratio of companies with the top1

shareholder's control power  = 1. It suggests that this result has not occurred because of the

top1 shareholder's own choice but rather because of a defeat in the competition for  = 1,

which they can't but accept.

Notes: [-1.,+1.] = number of companies with top1 shareholder's  in [ - 1. ,  + 1. ].

All of these indicate that, for almost every company in the Chinese stock market, the choice

of the top1 shareholder's optimal control power is  = 1. This result supports our theoretical

prediction above. Moreover, this gives us the opportunity to test our hypotheses using the ratio of

companies with top1 shareholder that have obtained control power with  = 1, =1. 3.5 The time distance between the state and the state of the evolution, h

 is a random variable. When we use the data of end of the year, it would only be a positive

integer as 1, 2, ...  years. Further, due to three-year election cycle of directors in listed company6,  would be more likely to be 1 or 2 years and more likely to have the probability of

1/2. So, we could consider  = 1.5 years statistically.

4. Results Using data of the Chinese stock market for 1996­2019 (sample size  50), we obtained a good fit with =1 , 1 , and 2-10 on  with Fourier function in first order (Figure 4 and Appendix Table A.1). The results could not refute our hypotheses statistically.

for private-owned firms on the main board in 1996­2019.

Further, since  = 1.5, we could have

=1() = =1(1.5).

0.553 - 0.014 cos (17.376 ) - 0.102 sin (17.376 ) = 0.553 - 0.014 cos (11.584 ) -

(11)

This is the wave equation of =1.

Further, we could have the probability density function of the distribution of top1

shareholder's control power:

=

0.553 - 0.014 {[1 - (0.553 -

 (17.376 ) - 0.102 2

 (17.376 ) , 2
0.102  (17.376

))]



1 0.1662

-(2-0.01.646627)2 ,

 = 1, (0,1).

(12)

This is the probability evolution of top1 shareholder's control power.

In contrast, in the state-owned firms on the main board as well as state- and private-owned

firms on the SME and GEM boards, the state-owned top1 shareholder is unable to reduce his

share rate normally by the interference and restriction from the government, which makes the

15

probability of top1 shareholder's control power being 1 at  is greater than 1/2; and the top1 shareholder of the firm on the SME and GEM boards reduces his share rate abnormally by the fraudulent practices in the imperfect stock market, which makes the probability of top1 shareholder's control power being 1 at  is less than 1/2. These would make that the same fittings deviate from those patterns in private-owned firms on the main board. The results are consistent with our predictions (Appendix Figure A.1, Table A.2, Figure A.2, A.3, Table A.3, A.4).
=1 is not correlative to changes in the stock market index and economic growth of China. Moreover, 1 and 2-10 have a certain correlation with changes in the stock market index (Appendix Figure A.4 and Table A.5). This explains the independent and universal feature of =1 and the dependence of 1 and 2-10 on the opportunity cost of shareholding.
5. Conclusion Our framework for corporate top1 shareholder's control power differs from empirical models that fit curves to phenomenological data. In contrast, we theoretically and quantitatively deduce that the probability of top1 shareholder obtaining optimal control power evolves in Fibonacci series pattern. This captures the salient, dynamic, and universal features of normal firm in normal market. This specific pattern demonstrates the elemental dynamics of the shareholder's control right and power. It implies that top1 shareholder with greater comparative advantage of entrepreneurial talent over other shareholders could win optimal control power with less comparative advantage of share rate over other shareholders. It indicates the efficiency of the allocation of right and power among corporate shareholders. This deduction may be applied to understand the efficiency equivalence of "dual-class share structure" and "one share one vote" under zero transaction cost condition. Furthermore, we may generalize this theory to analyze the behaviors of politic parties.
We quantitatively confirm this in line with the data for the Chinese stock market. Nevertheless, how well it captures the fundamental feature of corporate control power in other
16

markets such as in the US or Europe remains to be tested.
