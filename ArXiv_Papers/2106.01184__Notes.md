## Abstract

Thirdly, our model and our accompanying theoretical results have been fully formalised in the Agda theorem prover. The resulting library is a powerful tool for quickly prototyping and formally verifying new policy languages. As an example, we formally verify the correctness of a policy language with many of the features of BGP including communities, conditional policy, path-inflation and route filtering.
