## Abstract

Defined by Borel, a real number is normal to an integer base $b$, greater than or equal to $2$, if in its base-$b$ expansion every block of digits occurs with the same limiting frequency as every other block of the same length. We consider the problem of insertion in constructed base-$b$ normal expansions to obtain normality to base $(b+1)$.
