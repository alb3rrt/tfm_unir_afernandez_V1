## Abstract

Great achievements in last five years, such as record-efficient amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells and cutting-edge perovskite/SHJ tandem solar cells, place hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) at the forefront of emerging photovoltaics. Due to the extremely low doping efficiency of trivalent boron (B) in amorphous tetravalent silicon, light harvesting of aforementioned devices are limited by their fill factors (FF), which is a direct metric of the charge carrier transport. It is challenging but crucial to develop highly conductive doped a-Si:H for minimizing the FF losses. Here we report intensive light soaking can efficiently boost the dark conductance of B-doped a-Si:H "thin" films, which is an abnormal Staebler-Wronski effect. By implementing this abnormal effect to SHJ solar cells, we achieve a certificated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.18% (26.05% on designated area) with FF of 85.42% on a 244.63-cm2 wafer. This PCE is one of the highest reported values for total-area "top/rear" contact silicon solar cells. The FF reaches 98.30 per cent of its Shockley-Queisser limit.
