## Abstract

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) shielding constants of transition metals in solvated complexes are computed at the relativistic density functional theory (DFT) level. The solvent effects evaluated with subsystem-DFT approaches are compared with the reference solvent shifts predicted from supermolecular calculations. Two subsystem-DFT approaches are analyzed -- in the standard frozen density embedding (FDE) scheme the transition metal complexes are embedded in an environment of solvent molecules whose density is kept frozen, in the second approach the densities of the complex and of its environment are relaxed in the "freeze-and-thaw" procedure. The latter approach improves the description of the solvent effects in most cases, nevertheless the FDE deficiencies are rather large in some cases.
