Inspired by investigations of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) produced in the Cold Atom Laboratory (CAL) aboard the International Space Station, we present a study of thermodynamic properties of shell-shaped BECs. Within the context of a spherically symmetric `bubble trap' potential, we study the evolution of the system from small filled spheres to hollow, large, thin shells via the tuning of trap parameters. We analyze the bubble trap spectrum and states, and track the distinct changes in spectra between radial and angular modes across the evolution. This separation of the excitation spectrum provides a basis for quantifying dimensional cross-over to quasi-2D physics at a given temperature. Using the spectral data, for a range of trap parameters, we compute the critical temperature for a fixed number of particles to form a BEC. For a set of initial temperatures, we also evaluate the change in temperature that would occur in adiabatic expansion from small filled sphere to large thin shell were the trap to be dynamically tuned. We show that the system cools during this expansion but that the decrease in critical temperature occurs more rapidly, thus resulting in depletion of any initial condensate. We contrast our spectral methods with standard semiclassical treatments, which we find must be used with caution in the thin-shell limit. With regards to interactions, using energetic considerations and corroborated through Bogoliubov treatments, we demonstrate that they would be less important for thin shells due to reduced density but vortex physics would become more predominant. Finally, we apply our treatments to traps that realistically model CAL experiments and borrow from the thermodynamic insights found in the idealized bubble case during adiabatic expansion.

I. INTRODUCTION
The physics of Bose-Einstein condensates that form closed shell-like geometries is a fascinating and farreaching topic which spans a range of physical scales and phenomena. On astronomic scales, for instance, portions of neutron star interiors could potentially contain superfluid spherical-shell structures [1, 2]. Exotic stars known as "boson stars" have also been hypothesized to form when a complex scalar field couples to gravity [3]. On the microscopic length scales of trapped ultracold atoms, concentric shells of differing phases can be generated in the setting of Bose-Fermi mixtures [4­7] as well as in bosonic optical lattices, which can preferentially favor superfluid versus Mott insulating phases in different regions [8­13]. The prospect of realizing isolated shell-shaped condensates has received a surge of interest [14­27]. However, on Earth, gravity renders such a realization challenging by causing trapped gases to pool at the bottom of the trap. Terrestrial experiments done in free-fall can mitigate this problem [25, 28, 29], but the inherently short condensate lifetimes are undesirable. It would thus be ideal to probe shell-shaped condensates in perpetual free-fall. The International Space Station

(ISS) provides precisely these conditions, operating in a microgravity environment.
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) shells in isolation would provide an arena for studying numerous interesting features which could translate to salient properties of shells in these various settings. The topology of hollowedout fluid structures shows innate differences from fullyfilled structures. The presence of an inner and an outer boundary affects collective mode spectra, vortex physics, and thermodynamics. With regards to geometry, all these features show unique characteristic properties as a spherical system undergoes an evolution from filled to slightly hollowed out to the thin-shell limit, including tell-tale signatures of topological change. In principle, this evolution can be realized by forming a condensate in a trap that can produce the standard filled geometry, and then, as exemplified by the `bubble trap' [14, 15], the hollowing out can take place by tuning trap parameters. A major aspect of BEC shells, which we address here, is the thermodynamics behind how a hollow shell condensate structure can be created at finite temperature. Towards actual realization of such structures, our theoretical analyses closely target the experiments being conducted by two of us (D. A. and N. L.) aboard the ISS.
In 2018 the Cold Atom Laboratory (CAL), developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was successfully launched into orbit aboard the ISS. CAL's design allows for remote generation of BECs in microgravity [22, 26] and has been able to produce large millimeter scale ultracold bubbles in the 10 - 100 nK temperature range

2

[30]. CAL offers wide capabilities for generating ultracold mixtures [22], but important to this work is its ability to generate so-called "dressed potentials" [24]. In this mode of operation, an initial non-hollow condensate is prepared using magnetically trapped 87Rb atoms in the |F = 2, mF = 2 hyperfine state [24]. A radio frequency (rf) signal is then turned on which modifies the potential experienced by the atoms. By modifying this rf "detuning" signal, one can produce potentials capable of harboring BEC shells. The first set of experiments reveal a dramatic expansion and hollowing-out of an initial condensate as it undergoes significant thermodynamic changes [30­32].
In this work, complementing the CAL experiments, we theoretically investigate the thermodynamic process of a trapped Bose gas, initially forming a compact filled sphere, undergoing adiabatic expansion due to changing trap parameters to form a large, thin spherical shell. Specifically, we consider two aspects of this process ­ in a bubble trap geometry, for fixed number of gas particles, how does the temperature of the system evolve under adiabatic expansion? How does this contrast with the critical temperature for condensation for a given set of trap parameters? We also perform an analysis for the experimental traps employed on CAL. Recent work has begun to address related issues; aspects of a thin spherical shell's thermodynamics have been investigated [33, 34], including the fate of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in a closed, thin-shell geometry [35].
Our findings here make for a comprehensive thermodynamic study of this unique structure and evolution in and of itself while also informing the related experiments. They predict the manner in which the temperature of the Bose-gas would change during the adiabatic hollowingout expansion. Comparing with the local critical temperature throughout the process, we are led to conclude that there is a narrow window of parameters in which a large thin condensate shell can be created. We go beyond the semi-classical approximation, whose predictions we show should be taken with care in the limit of large thin systems. We also include, at first order, the effect of interactions and show that they are largely unimportant in the same large thin limit. Our results, while predicting that the first set of shell-potential experiments aboard the ISS are unlikely to retain condensation at the larger radii, point to the range of parameters wherein large condensate shells occur. They also ascertain the stability of the spectacular systems that these first experiments exhibit: compared to regular trapped gases of micron-scale, thousand-fold adiabatic expansion gives rise to exquisite delicate gigantic thermal gas bubbles.
This paper is organized as follows: we first consider bosons subject to a radial "bubble trap" potential [14, 15]. After exploring the spectral properties of bubble-trapped states, we use this information to calculate thermodynamic quantities in the noninteracting case. In particular, we determine the BEC critical temperature as the potential evolves from a filled-to-hollow

sphere geometry along with the temperature of the system when the expansion process is performed adiabatically. Strikingly, we find that adiabatic expansion of a BEC leads to condensate depletion. We then contrast our results with the semiclassical approximation and find semiclassical predictions overestimate the critical temperature and hence partially conceal the condensate depletion phenomena. Next, we consider the effects of interactions and dimensionality. Contrasting zero-temperature Gross-Pitaevskii numerics with various approximation schemes reveals that, for fixed particle number systems, the decreasing density of an expanding bubble means the noninteracting description is wellsuited to describe thin-shell geometries. We then use this result to develop a mean-field theory for Bogoliubov collective excitations. Consistent with the above discussion, we find thermodynamic predictions for thin shells are relatively close to the predictions in the absence of interactions. By construction, the Bogoliubov effective theory assumes spontaneous U (1) symmetry breaking; hence, we address the eventual breakdown of this description as one crosses over into the 2D limit. Finally, we apply the lessons of the bubble trap to compute thermodynamics in trapping potentials achieved with CAL. We conclude with an outlook on how our work can inform the CAL experiments and discuss possible manifestations of nonequilibrium physics.

II. BUBBLE TRAP SPECTRUM AND STATES
Here we introduce the bubble trap as means to continuously tune the system geometry. We then discuss the properties of states subject to the bubble trap potential as it deforms from a filled sphere to a hollow thin shell.

A. Trapping potential

Our focus is the thermodynamics of ultracold bosonic gases trapped in potentials that allow geometries ranging from a filled sphere to a nearly two-dimensional hollow shell. Such dimensional crossovers have been investigated employing hard-wall spherical potentials and confinement to spherical surfaces [36, 37]. Here we employ trapping potential forms that can be continuously tuned to span the whole range and can approximate the related experimental setting of shell-shaped BECs aboard CAL [24].
As our starting point, we model the dilute collection of trapped, interacting bosons in three dimensions using the standard description provided by the Hamiltonian:

H^ =

d3x ^

2
- 2 + V

^ + g ^^^ ^ ,(1)

R3

2m

where ^(x) represents the annihilation operator for a boson of mass m, V (x) describes an external trapping po-

3

tential, and g represents a coarse-grained contact interaction between particles. In terms of microscopic physics, g = 4 2as/m where as is the s-wave scattering length [38­41]. Here, we study the cases of no interactions (g = 0) and repulsive ones (g > 0).
First, we consider an idealized rotationally-symmetric "bubble trap" potential which can tune between 3D spheres and quasi-2D thin spherical shells [14, 15]:

Vbubble(x)

where sl = /2m0 is the oscillator length associated with frequency 0 and  and  are dimensionless parameters that control the radius and width of the potential well [42, 43]. By varying these parameters, we can probe thermodynamics through the range of desired geometries, as shown in Fig. 1. In particular, ramping up the value of  at fixed  deforms the trap to produce a thin-shell whose potential minimum is at fixed, nonzero radius. Physically,  () corresponds to the rf detuning (Rabi frequency) of a trapped atomic gas [24].

FIG. 1. (Color online) Top (bottom) row: surface plots (spatial slices) of the bubble trap at various detuning values. As  increases, the location of the radially symmetric potential minimum, sl , expands outwards leading to the formation of shell-shaped structures.

When considering the bubble trap above, we work in

units where sl = 0 = m = kB = 1, and set all other

parameters to correspond closely with the physically rel-

evant case of ongoing CAL experiments. Namely, we

take the number of atoms to be N = 50000, the di-

mensionless "width" parameter to be  = 250, and (to

expand from a filled-sphere to a hollow shell) consider

a range of values for the dimensionless "radius" param-

eter:  = 0  1000. For a trap with bare frequency

0/2 = 80 Hz, these correspond to a Rabi frequency of

5 kHz and a maximum detuning of 10 kHz. In cases where

we consider nonzero interactions, we use a value appro-

priate for both 87Rb and the CAL experiment, setting

which

corresponds

to

a

(dimensionless)

interaction strength of 8N as/sl = 7000 for N = 50000

atoms.

B. Spectrum and states

We first find the energy spectrum and eigenstates for a noninteracting system confined by the bubble trap of Eq. (2). Due to its rotational symmetry, eigenstate wavefunctions can be written in the form

klm(x)

=

1 r

ukl

(r)Ylm(,

),

(3)

where (r, , ) are spherical coordinates, and Ylm are spherical harmonics having l = 0, 1, . . . ,  and m = -l, . . . , l. The quantum number "k" completes the indexing by accounting for the radial direction. Obtaining the eigenstates then reduces to solving the radial component of the Schr¨odinger equation:

2 d2

2l(l + 1)

- 2m dr2 + V (r) + 2mr2 ukl(r) = klukl(r),(4)

where ukl(0) = ukl() = 0. For fixed angular momentum quantum number l, the index k = 0, 1, . . .  is chosen to correspond to increasing energy eigenvalues: 0,l  1,l  · · ·  ,l.
We employ a simple finite-difference method to discretize and then numerically solve Eq. (4) as the detuning parameter  is varied. As  increases (see Fig. 1), the peak of each eigenstate's probability density expands radially outward. Hence, a state localized near the origin for small  becomes squeezed into a hollow thin shell at large . Fig. 2a shows the evolution of the bubble trap ground state during this hollowing-out procedure. Because the probability density decays gradually towards zero away from its peak, determining the precise  value at which the topological transition from a filled-to-hollow sphere occurs is subtle. Nevertheless, if we say an inner radius is present when the probability density decays to a `sufficiently small' value while moving radially inward from its peak value, we can estimate the location of the hollowing-out transition. We find the hollowing transition occurs around   75.
In the case of a thin spherical shell, it is straightforward to approximate the geometry of the ground state. The radius of the shell corresponds closely to the location of the potential minimum sl . Also, the potential in this limit can be modelled by a shifted harmonic oscillator. Using a one-dimensional shifted oscillator to capture the the radial behaviour of the ground state, we expect the thickness of the shell to scale as sl(/)1/4. This means the approximate volume of the ground state density scales like s3l 3/41/4. We see, therefore, that as the bubble expands with increasing  and fixed , the thickness of the shell decreases but the total volume increases.
Turning our attention to the behavior of the radial wavefunctions ukl(r) (Fig. 2b), we note that the quantum number k labels the number of nodes in each radial wavefunction (disregarding the zeros due to boundary conditions). Since this quantum number labels increasingly larger energy eigenvalue states, it is natural to as-

sociate large k values with more oscillatory radial wave-

functions (increased radial kinetic energy). The wave-

functions with k = 0 are of particular importance as they

have implications for the dimensionality of the system:

these states have their support around the spherically-

symmetric potential minimum and hence, for large ,

correspond to a state localized inside a hollow thin-shell.

States with k > 0 have an increased number of nodes

in the radial direction and hence a larger kinetic energy

cost. At large , states with k = 0 have no "excitation"

k=1

in the radial direction and are indicative of a quasi-2D

system.

A partial spectrum of the bubble trap is shown in

Fig. 2c. Note that for a given k value, as the angular

momentum quantum number l increases, so does the cor-

responding energy kl. Furthermore, for a given l value, we find the energy difference between adjacent k bands

begins to increase with the detuning parameter . The

spacing between the bottom of the k = 0 and k = 1

bands indicates the energy scale at which the system will

enter a quasi-2D regime.

III. BUBBLE TRAP THERMODYNAMICS

(NONINTERACTING)

In this section, we use the above bubble-trapped states to numerically compute thermodynamic quantities in the absence of interactions as the trap evolves from a filled sphere to thin shell geometry. We find that adiabatic expansion of a BEC leads to condensate depletion and hence an initial condensate can be lost during the process.

and so on. As l increases, so does the corresponding energy

been removed from the image for clarity.

For a noninteracting (NI) system, thermodynamic properties follow from Eq. (4) (see appendix A for details on the thermodynamic formalism). Of crucial importance for shell-shaped condensates is the BEC critical temperature, Tc, which is computed by solving the implicit equation:

1

N = (2l + 1)

.

(5)

e(kl-0)/kB Tc - 1

kl=0

where N is the number of particles in the system and we denote the single-particle ground state (k = 0, l = 0, m = 0) with subscript "0". From the spectrum of the bubble trap, we can determine the BEC critical temperature as a function of detuning, . Fig. 3 shows that as the system expands from a filled sphere to a hollow, thin shell, the critical temperature drops significantly.
Qualitatively, this can be explained by considering the phase-space density n/nQ(T ) where n = N/Vol is the particle density, where Vol represents the characteristic volume of the bubble, and nQ(T )  (mkBT /2 2)3/2 is the quantum density. Condensation should occur when

low thin-shell (Fig. 1). The temperature is given in units of

the phase-space density is on the order of unity. As the system expands from a filled sphere into a thin shell, the volume of the shell increases while the particle number is fixed, hence the particle density decreases. Therefore, one must lower the temperature to obtain a phase-space density on the order of unity.
In addition to the reduction of Tc at large detuning, the function Tc() decreases monotonically with  and also possesses an inflection point at a small detuning value of   38. We note this inflection point occurs slightly before the hollowing-out transition discussed earlier.
In contrast to a recent calculation by Tononi et al [33] of the BEC critical temperature of a Bose gas in a similar geometry, which relied on the semiclassical approximation, here we obtain our result using the (numeric) spectrum of the bubble trap. Shortly, we will directly compare the semiclassical method with the spectral method and find that the Tc obtained from the spectrum is lower than that obtained semiclassically.

B. Adiabatic expansion and cooling
To model the creation of large bubbles on CAL, we consider an initially harmonic trap (and filled, spherical system) being expanded outwards by increasing the detuning parameter . We assume this process is performed adiabatically (i.e. without generating heat) and at fixed particle number. Here, we enforce adiabaticity by considering an isentropic (constant entropy) process and compute the temperature during adiabatic expansion by solving the implicit equations for net particle number

N and entropy S:

N = (2l + 1)fkl,

(6a)

kl

S= kB (2l + 1) [(1 + fkl) ln(1 + fkl) - fkl ln fkl] , (6b)
kl

where fkl = 1/(e(kl-µ) - 1) is the Bose-Einstein distribution function at chemical potential µ and inverse temperature (= 1/kBT ). We model the adiabatic expansion process as follows: we fix a starting temperature (prior to expansion, at  = 0) and then solve Eq. (6) to find the associated entropy. Next, we model expanding the gas by increasing . At each stage of the expansion, we determine the new temperature by solving Eq. (6) such that both the particle number N and the entropy S are fixed. Note that when T > Tc one must solve for both temperature and chemical potential, but when T < Tc and µ  -0 , one must instead solve for the temperature and number of condensed particles, N0.
We note that one expects adiabatic expansion of the bubble cools the system. For instance, during an isentropic process, a free or harmonically trapped BEC obeys the characteristic relation Vol T  = const. where the exponent  is positive; hence, increasing the volume of the gas results in a decrease in temperature.

C. Cooling by adiabatic expansion depletes the condensate

We next present numerical solutions for the temper-

ature of a bubble-trapped system during adiabatic ex-

pansion at various starting temperatures; the results are

summarized in Fig. 4a. We note that the BEC critical

temperature decreases faster than the temperature of the

gas as it adiabatically expands. This means that if one

does not sufficiently cool the system before beginning to

expand it into a bubble shape, an initially condensed

system transitions during expansion into a thermal gas.

An explicit example of this can be seen for the adiabatic

expansion temperature profile with initial temperature

kB Ti

= 30

0 2

(which corresponds roughly to a temper-

ature of 60 nK for a 80 Hz trap). Although the system

before expansion is in the condensed phase, it eventually

finds itself above the condensate transition temperature

as the parameter  increases.

Even if the initial temperature is low enough to remain

in the condensed phase for the entire expansion, we find

that the condensate fraction decreases as the system ex-

pands. In other words, adiabatic expansion in this case

leads to a loss of phase-space density; this is a negative

version of the long-known phase-space density increases

at constant entropy exploited in various experiments [44­

47]. Figure. 4b explicitly shows the depletion upon adi-

abatic expansion for a few different initial temperatures

by plotting the condensate fraction N0/N . This effect is

pronounced when comparing the local condensate den-

sity with the excited state density at various stages in

we show

in Fig. 4c that there

condensate depletion at large .

It is important to note that although condensate deple-

tion during adiabatic expansion presents an experimen-

tal hindrance to observing large BEC shells, Fig. 4b also

shows that the degree of severity depends crucially on the

initial temperature prior to expansion. A system which

starts off colder experiences depletion at a far slower rate

when compared to one which starts off warmer.

D. Validity of the semiclassical approximation

It is instructive to see how results obtained using stan-

dard semiclassical methods (see appendix A) compare

with those obtained using the (numeric) bubble trap

spectrum (Fig. 5). Importantly, we find that the pre-

dictions of the semiclassical approximation become less

accurate as the shell is expanded (in particular, note the

difference in predicted BEC critical temperature at large

). The semiclassical approximation assumes the tem-

perature is much larger than the energy level spacings

over the energy range in which it is used. Discrepancies

between semiclassical and spectral calculations indicate

that this condition is not being satisfied. As the bub-

ble expands, the nature of energy levels change (recall

Fig. 2c) which, in turn, lowers both Tc and the temperature during adiabatic evolution. Although level spacings

at the bottom of each k band decrease during expansion,

the effects of higher angular momentum states must also

be considered. From Fig. 5, we conclude that the com-

bined effect of a decreasing temperature with the modi-

fied level spacings means semiclassical predictions should

be taken with some level of caution for thin-shell systems

or fully-expanded bubbles.

Notably, the semiclassical prediction for Tc in the thinshell becomes considerably higher than that obtained us-

ing the spectrum. At the highest detuning shown, the

difference

is

about 6.5

0 2

(roughly

12.5

nK

for

a

80

Hz

trap). Hence, for some range of initial temperatures be-

fore expansion, the semiclassical approximation will in-

correctly predict that an expanding gas will remain con-

densed when in fact it will transition to the normal phase.

Finally, we note that when T Tc, the temperature predictions during adiabatic expansion don't vary greatly

between the spectral and semiclassical methods. Fur-

thermore, even below Tc, the difference between the two methods is far less severe than that seen in the prediction

of the BEC critical temperature.

IV. EFFECTS OF INTERACTIONS AND DIMENSIONALITY

FIG. 5. (Color online) Comparison of our previous results using the spectrum of the bubble trap with the semiclassical approximation. Here, we show the BEC critical temperature for N = 50000 particles along with various adiabatic expansion temperature profiles. [The undashed (dashed) black (blue) line is Tc using the spectral (semiclassical) approach. The undashed (dashed) grey (magenta) lines are adiabatic expansion profiles using the spectral (semiclassical) approach.]

noninteracting description to be a good approximation for thin shells. We then use this result to develop an effective low temperature theory in a spontaneous U (1) symmetry broken phase and find, in the thin-shell regime, that interactions do little to modify the results obtained previously. We conclude by considering the breakdown of this mean-field theory approach as one crosses over from 3D to 2D physics.

A. Validity of the noninteracting description
Having described the thermodynamics of a bubble trapped gas in the NI (g = 0) limit, we now address the question of where the noninteracting description accurately captures salient features even when interactions are present. Working at zero temperature, we show here that for thin shells at fixed particle number, the NI picture indeed constitutes a reasonable description. We justify this assertion in two ways: 1) we analyze numeric solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for an experimentally-relevant interaction strength and contrast this data with both weakly- and strongly-interacting limiting cases, 2) we perform a variational calculation to gain insight into the role of interactions in the thin-shell limit.
Comparing condensate wavefunctions: The many-body ground state of Eq. (1) is characterized by a condensate wavefunction c(x) which obeys the timeindependent Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation:
2
0 = - 2m 2 + V (x) - µ + g|c(x)|2 c(x). (7)

Because the GP equation is nonlinear, analytic solutions

are typically unfeasible. Fortunately, in cases where g  0 or ( 2/2m)2c  0, which correspond physically to non- and strongly-interacting systems, respec-

tively, analytic solutions can be found.

In the absence of interactions, g = 0, we denote the

solution as the noninteracting condensate wavefunction: NI(x) = N00(x) where the subscript "0" denotes the single-particle ground state. In the opposite limit of

strong interactions, we use the Thomas-Fermi (TF) ap-

proximation and treat the kinetic contribution to Eq. (7)

as negligibly small [38, 39]. Dropping the kinetic term

allows one to solve the GP equation to obtain the TF

condensate wavefunction: |TF| = (µ - V )/g when V (x) < µ and TF = 0 otherwise [38, 39].

Numerical solutions for the ground state of Eq. (7) (at

a range of  values for the bubble trap potential, Eq. (2))

were found using an imaginary-time algorithm [48] and

taking the experimentally-relevant value of dimensionless

interaction strength, 8N as/sl = 7000.

using the numerically-solved (GP), noninteracting (NI),

and strongly-interacting (TF) condensate wavefunctions.

Fig. 6a shows the energy fractions as  is increased (ex-

panding the system from a filled-sphere to a thin-shell)

at T = 0, with fixed particle number, using the three

condensate wavefunctions.

From the numerically-solved GP results, one can see

clearly that the energy stored in interactions is the dom-

inant contribution for small  (filled spheres), but be-

comes the least significant contribution for large  (thin

shells). For parameter regimes in which the interaction

energy fraction is sufficiently suppressed, one expects the

NI case to give a reasonable description of the system.

Let us now compare results between the various con-

densate wavefunctions. For small , the TF approxi-

mation does reasonably well compared to the numerical

solution (GP) whereas the NI approximation does poorly;

hence, interactions are expected to be important in the

description of a bubble-trapped system in this param-

eter regime. Conversely, as  increases, and the shell

expands, the TF approximation becomes a poor approx-

imation of the GP numerics, whereas the NI approxi-

mation performs reasonably well. In particular, the TF

energy fractions become nearly constant, whereas the GP

interaction energy fraction falls drastically and begins to

converge with the NI wavefunction results for  300.

Thus, for thin shells, a NI description is a good approxi-

mation to the full solution with interactions. The break-

down of the TF approximation as  increases is due to

its failure to capture the rising kinetic energy fraction of

the GP condensate in this regime. We also note that, al-

though the NI and GP interaction energy fractions begin

to converge, the NI wavefunction systematically overesti-

mates the kinetic and underestimates the trap potential

energy fractions. To further contextualize these conclu-

FIG. 6. (Color online) Comparison between the zerotemperature GP, NI, and TF condensate wavefunctions at various detunings for N = 50000 atoms in the bubble trap. (a) From left to right, the fraction of energy stored as kinetic, trap potential, and interaction energy. Note: the bubble trap reference energy has been subtracted off from the potential. We also treated quantum depletion as nearly negligible for the NI condensate wavefunction [38] (we set N0 = 0.99N for T = 0). (b) Local condensate density at various detunings. The density is plotted in the z = 0 plane: nc(x, y, 0) = |c(x, y, 0)|2. In each plot, the color is normalized such that black (yellow) corresponds to the minimum (maximum) density value.
sions, we direct the reader to Fig. 6b which shows the (T = 0) local condensate density at various detuning values. Here, one can see clearly that for filled spheres (thin shells) the TF (NI) condensate wavefunction captures the salient spatial features of the GP results.
Variational calculation: To further understand the above results, let us look for an origin to the decreasing interaction energy fraction during the zero-temperature expansion. This result might be perplexing ­ one might suspect interactions to play a prominent role when the shell becomes thin and atoms get squeezed into a space of small width. However, one should keep in mind that the particle density is going down as the system becomes thinner: the particle number is held fixed, while the condensate volume, which we argued earlier should scale as

s3l 3/41/4 in the NI case, is increasing as the bubble expands.
To see this more concretely, we perform a variational
calculation [38] with a trial condensate wavefunction:

trial(x) = A F

|x| - a b

ei(x),

(8)

where the variational parameters A, a, and b are all nonnegative real constants, (x) is the phase of the condensate wavefunction, and F (·) is a (nonnegative) smooth real function which decays to zero for large arguments [49]. For example, we could use a Gaussian, F (u) = e-u2/2 [38, 49], from which one can see the length scales have a natural interpretation: a  (Rout + Rin)/2 describes the average shell radius and b  Rout - Rin describes the shell thickness where Rout (Rin) is the outer (inner) radius of the condensate shell. In this context, we can define a thin-shell as one for which a/b 1.
We now insert the trial wavefunction into H[c, c] - µN [c, c] where H[·] and N [·] are the Hamiltonian and particle number functionals respectively. Considering no superflow, m  = 0, we extremize the functional and obtain the following forms for the kinetic, trap potential, and interaction energy terms in the thin shell limit, b/a  0:

where we have used the relationship N  C0A2a2b as b/a  0 to replace the (amplitude) variational parame-

ter A with the particle number N (which normalizes the

trial wavefunction), and the numbers C0, . . . , C3 are independent of the variational parameters A, a, and b. To

reach Eq. (9b), we took the thin-shell limit, b/a  0,

such that  remained fixed and assumed the variational

parameter a was closeto the location of the bubble trap's

potential minimum sl . For clarity, in Eq. (9b) we also

subtracted off the contribution due to the bubble trap

reference energy 

0 2

.

From these asymptotic results, one finds that the frac-

tion of energy stored in interactions relative to the total

energy becomes vanishingly small in the thin-shell limit.

This occurs because the ratio of interaction energy over kinetic energy is proportional to N b/a2. Therefore, for

fixed particle number, the zero-temperature interaction

energy fraction tends toward zero for increasingly thin

shells.

B. Do interactions help preserve the condensate?
In the NI case, we found earlier that adiabatically expanding a condensate into a thin shell led to a decreasing

9

condensate fraction. A natural question is how interactions modify this picture. However, based on the arguments of the previous section, we should not expect dramatic changes in the thin-shell limit where the NI case is expected to be a good approximation. In general, computing thermodynamics in the presence of interactions is far more involved than in their absence [40, 41]; here we proceed using a standard Bogoliubov quasiparticle description (see appendix A). In particular, at temperatures far below the U (1) symmetry breaking transition, we develop a mean-field theory by expanding the boson field about the NI condensate wavefunction c(x)  NI(x). This formalism assumes that the NI condensate wavefunction is a reasonable approximation to the true solution of the GP equation, which we have shown above to be correct for a thin shell. Thermodynamics then follow from solutions to the Bogoliubov equations (see appendix B for the case of the bubble trap) which we solve numerically using a finite-difference method.
As a means to probe the effect of interactions on the thermodynamics of an expanding system, we set a condensate fraction, N0/N , and then model expanding the gas by increasing . Instead of doing the expansion adiabatically, here we simply ask: what temperature is required to maintain the given condensate fraction? This is motivated by the fact that the NI condensate wavefunction is a poor approximation of the true condensate wavefunction at low-detunings. To evolve an initial ( = 0) temperature isentropically, we need to determine and fix the entropy at the start of the expansion, but because our effective theory assumes the NI condensate wavefunction is a reasonable reference state, any thermodynamic predictions we make at such small  are suspect.
In Fig. 7 we compare the temperatures required for an 80% condensate fraction in the NI and Bogoliubov formalisms. In the regime of applicability of our Bogoliubov description using the NI condensate wavefunction, we see that there is a range of geometries over which interactions do increase the temperature required to obtain the given condensate fraction, but that this effect is very small. We note that the Bogoliubov temperature briefly drops below its NI counterpart, but then rises and remains slightly above for the rest of the expansion. Consistent with the arguments of the the previous section, we thus find that interactions do little to change the thermodynamics of thin shells.
C. Dimensional crossover
While the previous thermodynamic calculations depend on mean-field considerations, there are several limits in which these approaches would not suffice. First, the finite size of the sphere results in deviations from the thermodynamic limit. In principle, first order corrections could be taken into account using finite-size scaling analyses [50].
As we consider thinner shells, a more drastic effect

comes from reduction in effective dimensionality. The

system enters the two-dimensional regime at tempera-

tures below which excitations along the radial direction

become energetically unfavorable. More precisely, ap-

pealing to the energy spectrum in Fig. 2c, energy levels

k,l are characterized by excitations along the radial (k) and angular (l) directions. For temperatures low enough

to excite only the k = 0 band, we have the condition

kBT < 1,0 - 0,0. At the highest detuning shown in

Fig. 2c, we find 1,0 - 0,0  4

0 2

which corresponds to a

temperature scale on the order of 10 nK for a 80 Hz trap.

Below this temperature, and at the largest detunings, we

expect the emergence of two-dimensional physics; this

regime clearly requires treatments that go beyond mean-

field.

As with planar thin films, defects such as vor-

tices form the natural source of excitations that com-

plement the mean-field hydrodynamic long-wavelength,

low-frequency excitations [51]. In previous work by

two of the current authors and collaborators, we

evaluated the energy for creating a vortex-antivortex

pair at opposite sides of a spherical condensate

where Rout is the outer

radius,  is the shell thickness, 0 is the coherence

Thus, depending on the parameters, even before entering

the two-dimensional limit, we may well access a finite-

thickness regime in which vortex-antivortex pair excita-

tions become favorable above a certain temperature, thus

destroying condensation in the system.

In the two dimensional limit, the proliferation of such

vortex-antivortex pairs renders the critical temperature

to take the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) form

10

[53, 54]. The effect of curvature on such physics is highly interesting in and of itself [55­58]. In recent work, Tononi and co-workers demonstrated that in the precise shell setting considered here and of relevance to CAL, the BKT transition finds its finite-size manifestation [35].
V. APPLICATIONS TO THE CAL TRAP
Having found the change in temperature and condensate transition temperature of a system undergoing adiabatic expansion from a filled sphere to a thin shell in an idealized bubble trap, we now consider the expansion of a system in a realistic CAL trap: V (x) = VCAL(x). In the microgravity environment aboard the ISS, CAL is able to produce exceptionally large mm-scale bubbles in both filled and hollow regimes. Figure. 8 shows a small sample of the CAL dressed potentials experienced by magnetically trapped 87Rb atoms. As discussed in [24], these remarkable dressed potentials are generated using atomchip current configurations. By increasing the rf detuning signal, one can deform the trap geometry to produce shell-shaped potential-minimum surfaces. The CAL trap is thus broadly similar to the bubble trap. As a result, much of the bubble trap physics discussed above should be applicable to the CAL experiment.

FIG. 8. (Color online) Spatial slices and surface plots of the CAL trap at various detuning frequencies. In contrast to the bubble trap, the CAL trap is anisotropic, hence the images are shown along different spatial axes. Each consecutive row of images corresponds to a higher detuning frequency, with the first row corresponding to the initial or "bare" trap.
There are crucial differences in the details though; unlike the bubble trap, the CAL trap is spatially inhomogeneous, breaking rotational symmetry. This means quantum-mechanical modelling of CAL trap thermodynamics is significantly more difficult, requiring solutions of three-dimensional partial differential equations as opposed to one-dimensional radial equations. Fortunately, some of the experimentally-relevant adiabatic expansions occur at temperatures above Tc and hence numericallyexpensive diagonalization can be avoided through use of

the semiclassical approximation. Here we use the semiclassical approach to obtain ther-
modynamics during system expansion in the CAL trap. To carry out our calculations, CAL atom-chip current data is used as input to generate a spatial grid of dressed potentials, VCAL(x), appropriate for 87Rb atoms in the |F = 2, mF = 2 hyperfine state [24]. Using the semiclassical approximation for NI atoms, we compute both the BEC critical temperature and the temperature of the system during adiabatic expansions for a few experimentally-relevant initial temperatures (T i = 97, 289, 387, 597 nK) with the results displayed in Fig. 9. We see both the BEC critical temperature and the temperature during adiabatic expansions decrease with applied detuning frequency. However, Tc does not decrease noticeably faster than the adiabatic curve for the case of the initially-condensed gas. This same phenomenon was observed in the semiclassical treatment of the bubble trap (see Fig. 5). In the case of the bubble trap, we saw that for temperatures at or below Tc, the semiclassical approach became less accurate as detuning increased and the bubble became thin. Most notably, we saw that the semiclassical model overestimates the BEC critical temperature for large bubbles. Hence, we find it is likely that, at these experimentally-relevant starting temperatures, that adiabatic expansions in the traps on CAL will produce thermal clouds rather than condensates.

VI. OUTLOOK
In summary, we have presented a thorough study of the thermodynamic properties of BECs in shell-shaped geometries while working in parameter regimes applicable to CAL experiments. We began by charting out the spec-

11

trum and eigenstates of a bubble trap potential through the evolution of trap parameters for a condensate from a filled sphere to hollow thin shell. Based on this analysis, we numerically computed thermodynamic quantities for a noninteracting system and found that adiabatic expansion leads to condensate depletion. Even in the presence of interactions, we argued that our conclusions hold for fixed particle systems in the thin-shell limit. Finally, using semiclassical methods to calculate thermodynamic properties of 87Rb atoms in CAL experimental traps, we made the connection between this realistic system and the bubble trap more concrete.
While several immediate avenues open up with regards to BECs in shell-shaped geometries, we first note: the CAL experiments, corroborated by theory, show something remarkable. In the microgravity environment,the shell inflation mechanism provided by the bubble trap allows for macroscopically large, suspended and contained gas structures to emerge. While macroscopic quantum coherence across these structures are likely to take further efforts, having topologically non-trivial thermal gases that span linear dimensions of the order of millimeters is a feat in and of itself. Our studies show here that it is not impossible to retain condensation during adiabatic expansion into these remarkable bubbles. The next-generation CAL experiments promise to achieve such structures, providing fertile ground for studies of multiple aspects of condensate shells.
With regards to equilibrium and linear response features, previous works have elucidated several prospects. These thermodynamic analyses would require further developments to connect with experiments, such as more sophisticated techniques for handling interactions, higher computational power for handling realistic trap geometries, and accounting for the strong asymmetry present in actual traps. Thermodynamic studies would also serve well to interface with other aspects of condensate shells that are being studied, including collective modes and vortex physics. Connecting the thermodynamic studies presented here with other settings for shell-shaped condensates, such as in stellar bodies, optical lattices, and Bose-Fermi mixtures, would offer new insights.
An additional realm poised for investigation involves non-equilibrium dynamics. In this work, we assumed adiabaticity and that the dynamic shell evolution involved a quasi-static process. Generally, there can be a variety of dynamical situations where adiabaticity breaks down; tracking the rate of entropy growth would be one step towards quantifying such deviations. Perhaps the most drastic deviation from adiabaticity concerns regimes in which the system is dynamically tuned across the BEC transition. Our results do indeed suggest that such transitions during expansion are likely. The expansion would then lead to non-equilibrium critical phenomenon of Kibble-Zurek physics [59­63]. This mechanism for producing defects, in this case, vortices [60, 64­66] and more complex defects in spinful condensates [67­71], would not only require important consideration in attempts to

achieve quantum coherence, micro-gravity and the shellshaped geometry could perhaps conspire to realize the much sought-after universal scaling behavior associated with this phenomenon.
These form but a few considerations in the fascinating and diverse realms that host these unique shellshaped condensate structures from stellar bodies to systems of co-existent phases on Earth to the on-going studies aboard the International Space Station. A common underlying thread is the extreme conditions and dynamic tuning offered by Nature at the astronomical realms and by advances in the ultracold experiments. One might speculate on how much of the thermodynamics of expanding shells discussed here would be relevant in stellar evolution and formation of neutron stars. In the meanwhile, while we have demonstrated that retaining a condensate through expansion can be a delicate matter, we have shown consistent with hints from CAL, that in the ultracold experimental realm, it is entirely possible to create remarkable, gigantic, diaphanous thermal bubbles.

Above, we introduced the coherent state path integral in the usual way [72]: N is an unimportant constant prefactor, [DD] is the integration measure of a complexvalued field (, x) with "time" coordinate   [0,  ] (the field obeys periodic boundary conditions in time),

(A2)

As T  0+ (  ), only field configurations which minimize the action contribute significant weight to the partition function. We denote such configurations as "condensate wavefunctions" c [38, 39] -- they are static and obey the time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, Eq. (7).

1. Thermodynamics of noninteracting bosons

With interactions turned off (g = 0), thermodynamics are obtained from the spectrum and wavefunctions of the single-particle Schr¨odinger equation [38, 39]. In this section, let "m" (m) denote the eigenstates (eigenvalues) of the Schr¨odinger equation:

m(x) = mm(x).

(A3)

Further, let m = 0 denote the ground state of this equa-
tion (which we assume is non-degenerate) and 0 denote the ground state energy. Expanding the field operator as ^(x) = m m(x)^bm in the operator formalism or the field as (, x) = nm e-in m(x)nm, where n are bosonic Matsubara frequencies [72], in the path integral

tion. If we move onto spatially resolved quantities, such
as the one-body density matrix,

^(x)^(x ) = m(x)m(x )fm,
m

(A6)

we see these require information on the wavefunctions. Thus, at least formally, solving Eq. (A3) gets us the thermodynamics.

2. The semiclassical approximation

When solutions to Eq. (A3) are intractable, a useful approximation exists. Provided the temperature is much larger than the spacing between single-particle energy levels,

kBT E,

(A7)

where E is a characteristic energy scale for the level

spacings, we can approximate thermodynamic quanti-

ties by replacing sums over eigenstates with integrals

[38, 39]. Making this replacement still requires a no-

tion of what the states in Eq. (A3) are; fortunately, this

condition is consistent with using the classical relation

3. Thermodynamics of (weakly) interacting bosons at low-temperatures
With interactions turned on (g > 0), computing the thermodynamics is no longer trivial [40, 41]. In general, path integral Monte Carlo methods offer a powerful way to proceed [74­76]. Green function methods have found success in analytically addressing questions such as the shift in Tc from its NI value [77­79]. At temperatures well below (or commensurate to) the BEC critical temperature, it is common to employ some variation of the meanfield theory introduced by Bogoliubov [37­39, 80, 81]. Because our interests lie in ultracold dilute atomic gases, we will restrict ourselves to temperatures far below the BEC transition, T Tc, and use a Bogoliubov quasiparticle description.
At sufficiently low temperatures, provided the dimension of space is larger than the lower critical dimension (which is 2 from the Mermin-Wagner­Hohenberg [82, 83] or Coleman [84] theorem), the system can spontaneously break the U (1) symmetry of the Hamiltonian. This is signified by a nonvanishing field expectation value: ^ 

13

c as T  0 where the ground state field configuration, c, is a solution to Eq. 7. At these low-temperatures, we perform a saddle-point analysis to reach an effective low-
temperature theory for fluctuations out of the conden-
sate. Namely, we use the "Bogoliubov shift":  = c+ [37, 81]. In the operator formalism:

where we introduced the wavefunctions u(x) and v(x). For positive energy solutions, the wavefunctions can be chosen to obey the orthonormality conditions [85]:

R3

(A12a)

R3

(A12b)

The Bogoliubov collective excitations in Eq. (A10) are created by:

^  d3x u^ - v^ ,
R3

(A13)

and thus u(x) and v(x) have the interpretation of a "particle" and "hole" wavefunction respectively. We also see the emergence of a "momentum operator" [38, 85],

P^z  d3x c ^ + h.c. ,
R3

(A14)

associated with a zero-mode solution of the Bogoliubov equations [85, 86]. The "mass" in the Hamiltonian,

M  µ d3x|c|2, is a (positive) inverse energy scale introduced for convenience [85]. Lastly, there is a shift in the reference energy that arises due to the pairing terms in Eq. (A9). This energy shift, which is nonpositive, is given by:

For temperatures far below the U (1) symmetry break-

order fluctuation terms in Eq. (A10). For consistency,

this requires that the "condensate depletion" is small:

but

as

discussed

in

[86]

doing

so

naively

leads to inconsistent results. Because the eigenstates of

the effective Hamiltonian have definite zero-mode mo-

mentum, i.e. Pz is a good quantum number, we necessarily find Q^2z diverges as a result of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Because ^^ contains a term

proportional the variance in the zero-mode position op-

erator, we then violate the condition that the conden-

sate depletion be small [86]. Thus, when using the ef-

fective Hamiltonian to compute thermal expectation val-

ues, one cannot simultaneously trace over the zero-mode

14

momentum states and demand the depletion be small.

Here, we avoid this issue in a pragmatic way through

our choice of the condensate wavefunction. We take

the condensate wavefunction to be the NI (g = 0) solution NI(x) = N00(x). Although this may seem like a poor choice, we find in the main text that us-

the m = 0 mode: a c-number is well-

justified for T Tc where N0 is macroscopically large;

thus, this approximation is standard in the Bogoliubov

treatment of the weakly interacting Bose gas [38, 39, 80].

Therefore, using the NI condensate wavefunction means

our effective Hamiltonian is still given by Eq. (A18), but

with the zero-mode momentum term removed.

We now calculate thermodynamic quantities in the

presence of (weak) interactions. First, the requirement

that ^  c as T  0 is consistent with the effective

theory: ^(x)

the field = N00

obtains a nonzero (x), spontaneously

expectation value, breaking the U (1)

symmetry of the Hamiltonian. This also states the con-

densate wavefunction is the mean-field in the broken sym-

metry phase for all temperatures at which the effective

Hamiltonian remains valid. Next, the one-body density

matrix becomes

^(x)^(x ) = N00(x)0(x )

+

[fu(x)u(x ) + (1 + f)v(x)v(x )] , (A20)

 (E >0)

where f = 1/(eE - 1) is the Bose-Einstein distribution function for the Bogoliubov quasiparticles. It is then straightforward to show the number of particles is:

N = N0(T )

(E >0)

Notice that to ensure self-consistency at temperature T ,

the number of particles in the NI ground state, N0(T ), must be chosen such that Eq. (A21) is satisfied.

Appendix B: Bogoliubov equations in the bubble trap

Within the mean-field theory discussed in appendix

A, thermodynamics of the interacting system follow

from solutions to the Bogoliubov equations, Eq. (A11).

Due to rotational invariance of the bubble trap and

condensate wavefunction, NI(r) where uN0 I(r) is the ground state

= so-

lution of the radial equation, Eq. (4), we can write the

Bogoliubov "particle" and "hole" wavefunctions respec-

tively as

(B1a) (B1b)

where the notation is the same as that used in Eq. (3). Here the radial wavefunctions ukl(r) and vkl(r) (which obey open boundary conditions) satisfy the Bogoliubov analog of the radial equation:

Eklukl= - 2m r2 + V +
