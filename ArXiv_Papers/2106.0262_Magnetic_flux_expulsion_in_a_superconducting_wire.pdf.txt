Magnetic flux expulsion in a superconducting wire
J. E. Hirsch Department of Physics, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0319
An electric current generates a magnetic field, and magnetic fields cannot exist in the interior of type I superconductors. As a consequence of these two facts, electric currents can only flow near the surface of a type I superconducting wire so that the self-field vanishes in the interior. Here we examine how an electric current flowing through the entire cross-section of a normal conducting wire becomes a surface current when it enters a superconducting portion of the wire. This geometry provides insight into the dynamics of magnetic flux expulsion that is not apparent in the Meissner effect involving expulsion of an externally applied magnetic field. It provides clear evidence that the motion of magnetic field lines in superconductors is intimately tied to the motion of charge carriers, as occurs in classical plasmas (Alfven's theorem) and as proposed in the theory of hole superconductivity [1], in contradiction with the conventional London-BCS theory of superconductivity.

I. INTRODUCTION

Within the conventional theory of superconductivity [2], an externally applied magnetic field is expelled from the interior of a metal becoming superconducting (Meissner effect) without any associated radial motion of charge carriers. This is at the very least surprising. Good electrical conductors resist changes of magnetic flux through their interior, through the generation of eddy currents that generate magnetic fields opposing flux changes (Lenz's law). Perfect conductors should make it impossible for magnetic field lines to cut through them. So how do superconductors expel magnetic fields?
The conventional theory of superconductivity does not provide an answer to this question. Classical plasmas do. In a perfectly conducting plasma, magnetic field lines can only move if electric charges move together with the field lines [3­5]. Magnetic field lines are frozen into the plasma. That is known as `Alfven's theorem' [6]. It is natural to assume that the same physics is at play in superconductors.
In recent work we have proposed that Alfven's theorem explains the Meissner effect [7], namely that the expulsion of magnetic field from the interior of a metal becoming superconducting results from outward motion of a conducting fluid that carries the magnetic field lines with it, as in a classical plasma. Furthermore we have argued that without outward motion of charge carriers there cannot be a Meissner effect [8]. In contrast, within the conventional theory of superconductivity [2] the magnetic field is expelled without any outward motion of charge carriers. The conventional theory does not offer a dynamical explanation for how this happens.
In this paper we consider a wire geometry and type I superconductors only. Figure 1 shows schematically the behavior of current streamlines and magnetic field lines of a superconducting cylindrical wire inserted between normal metal leads in steady state. These observable quantities result from solution of London's equation and Ampere's law [9]. Fig. 1 shows that when normal current carriers enter the superconducting region they acquire

outward radial velocity and flow towards the surface of the wire. The region close to the normal-superconductor boundary where there is radial motion of charge is of order of the London penetration depth, L. Beyond that region, current carriers flow parallel to the surface of the cylindrical wire within a London penetration depth of its surface and no current flows in the interior. We assume the current is smaller that the critical current
Concurrently, magnetic field lines that exist throughout the interior in the normal conductor move to the surface in the superconducting region following the current streamlines, and are always confined within a London penetration depth of the boundaries of the superconducting region, as the figure shows. If we imagine traveling with a charge carrier along a streamline with a magnetic field line next to us, we will see that the magnetic field line moves with us as we enter the superconducting region and we move towards the surface, as shown in Figure 1. Thus, the motion of magnetic field lines follows the motion of charge carriers, as we proposed is also true, but less evident, in the Meissner effect [7, 8].
Our explanation of the Meissner effect follows from the prediction of the theory of hole superconductivity [1] that when a metal enters the superconducting state electrons forming Cooper pairs expand their orbits giving rise to outward motion of negative charge [10]. This process is driven by lowering of quantum kinetic energy [11]. Concurrently, to preserve both charge and mass neutral-

2

ity in the interior, normal state hole carriers also move outward [12]. This outward motion of a charge-neutral mass-neutral fluid carries the magnetic field lines with it, as would happen in a classical plasma [7].
In this paper we argue that the known behavior of a superconducting wire carrying a current provides further evidence for our proposed explanation of the Meissner effect.

FIG. 2: When a portion of a normal metallic wire carrying current is cooled into a perfectly conducting state, the same current will continue to flow throughout the interior of the perfect conductor, as shown in the figure.

It is generally assumed that superconductors and perfect conductors behave identically in processes that do not involve a change in temperature. Here we point out that this is not so.
As is well known, if we cool a normal metal into the superconducting state in the presence of an external magnetic field, it behaves very differently than if we cool a normal metal into a perfectly conducting state in the presence of an external magnetic field. In the former case the magnetic field is expelled through the development of a Meissner surface current, whereas in the latter case the magnetic field remains frozen in the interior and no surface current flows.
Instead, if we consider a superconductor and a perfect conductor below their critical temperature initially without magnetic fields, they behave identically when we apply an external magnetic field: both develop the same surface current to prevent the magnetic field from penetrating, with the current flowing in a layer of thickness L, the London penetration depth, that is a function of carrier density and effective mass. The dynamics of the process by which this state is established is fully accounted for by Maxwell's equations, in particular Faraday's law, and Newton's laws.
Now let us consider the current-carrying wire shown in Fig. 1. If initially the middle section is in the normal state, current will flow throughout its cross section giving rise to magnetic field lines throughout the interior just like in the normal metal leads. This magnetic field is generated by the current itself, it is not an external magnetic field. If we now cool and the middle section becomes a perfect conductor, the pre-existent magnetic field lines will be frozen, which implies that the current will continue to flow uniformly throughout the cross section in the perfectly conducting region as shown in Fig. 2, unlike the superconductor shown in Fig. 1. So this different behavior between superconductor and perfect conductor upon changing the temperature is analogous to the situation with the Meissner effect.
However, consider now a wire with no current flowing initially where the middle section is either a perfect conductor or a superconductor. What happens if we apply a voltage across both ends of the normal conducting leads?
In the case of the superconductor, the current shown in Fig. 1 will flow: the state of the superconductor is inde-

pendent of its history. It is fully determined by Ampere's law

In the next sections we discuss the quantitative solution of these equations. Here we consider how they apply to a perfect conductor.
Recall that London's equation (2) can be derived by starting from the superconductor in the absence of a magnetic field and calculating the response of the system to electromagnetic fields assuming it is a perfect conductor [9]. The current is given by

Js(r, t) = nsevs(r, t)

remains valid at all times if it is valid initially, as will hap-
pen if initially J = B = 0. When we apply an external magnetic field or an external voltage to a superconductor or to a perfect conductor, if a current develops it has to satisfy Eq. (8).
For a superconductor that can happen when we apply a voltage across the wire, and the result is the steady state depicted in Fig. 1. However, a perfect conductor, unlike a superconductor, cannot be in the steady state depicted in Fig. 1. The streamlines in Fig. 1 indicate that carriers acquire an acceleration in the radial direction when they enter the superconducting region, but there is no electromagnetic force to provide that acceleration. Nor can the perfect conductor develop the uniform current density shown in Fig. 2, because it requires the interior magnetic field to change in the interior of the perfect conductor from its initial value 0 to a finite value, which cannot happen according to Faraday's law. Indeed, the state shown in Fig. 2 does not satisfy w = 0 (Eq. (8))
since  × vs = 0 and B = 0 in the interior.
Instead, what will happen when we apply a voltage across a perfect conductor is that a charge polarization will develop to account for the voltage drop, and no current will flow either in the normal nor the perfectly conducting region, as shown schematically in Fig. 3. Eq. (8) does apply to the perfectly conducting region but in
a trivial way, namely J = B = 0. If R is not zero but very small the system will eventually reach a steady state with uniform current distribution as in Fig. 2 that does not satisfy eq. (8).
Therefore, unlike the situation in the Meissner effect, the steady state situation shown in Fig. 1 is unique to superconductors and can never be attained by a perfect conductor independent of its history, hence it reveals key information on what makes a superconductor different from a perfect conductor. This will be discussed in the following sections.

III. FORMALISM

We consider first a planar instead of a cylindrical geometry, as shown in Fig. 4, since the mathematics is simpler (trigonometric instead of Bessel functions). We assume that current flows in the z direction in the normal region, and the superconducting region is -b  z  b. In the perpendicular (y^) direction, the current is confined to the region -a  y  a. In the normal region we assume uniform resistivity and hence uniform current den-
sity J = Jz^. In the superconducting region the current is given by

J = Jy(y, z)y^ + Jz(y, z)z^.

The magnetic field points in the x direction,

In the superconducting region, no normal current flows in steady state because it is shorted by the supercurrent. The supercurrent is determined by the London equation (2), which is

which properly satisfies the boundary condition B(y, ±b) = -(4/c)Jy, which is the magnetic field in the normal region.
For a wire with b >> a and for z far from the boundaries z = ±b, the currents and field reduce to

Jy(y, z) = 0

(21a)

The streamlines for the charge motion, denoted by y(z), satisfy

dy(z) dz

=

Jy(y, z) Jz(y, z)

so that in the superconducting region

y(z) = y0 +

(24)

with y0 = y(z = -b). In the normal region Jy = 0 so the streamlines are parallel to the z-axis. Figure 5 shows one example. It can be seen that the slope of the streamline changes discontinuously at the normalsuperconductor boundary.
In the superconducting region electrons move along the streamlines with velocity given by

V. THE N-S BOUNDARY

Bx = 0 and it is directly proportional to the local value of Bx for a given y, with the same proportionality constant independent of y. And it points in direction perpendic-
ular to B. So we ask: how can a magnetic field impart momentum to electric charges in an amount that is pro-
portional to its magnitude at that point in space and in
a direction perpendicular to its direction?
The answer is, of course, the magnetic Lorentz force [14]. That is the only way that magnetic fields exert forces on charges according to the laws of physics. The magnetic Lorentz force on a charge e is

At the N-S boundary, the current streamlines aquire discontinuously motion in the y-direction, as seen in Fig. 5. For L << a, b the current in the y direction at the phase boundary takes the simple form:

This is easily seen from Eqs. (17) and (18b), using the Fourier expansion for y

FIG. 9: How the momentum in the y direction results. As electrons enter into the superconducting region, the orbit expands from microscopic radius to radius 2L. vy results from the action of the magnetic field on the expanding orbits. As electrons depart the superconducting region, the orbit shrinks again and this imparts the same momentum in the y direction as when the carriers entered.

Figure 9 shows the resulting state. At the boundary

z = -b, this extra velocity acquired by the carriers is in the +y direction for y > 0 and in the -y direction for y < 0, since the magnetic field points in opposite directions. In the interior, the velocity of neighboring orbits point in opposite directions and cancel out. At the boundary z = +b, the orbits shrink again and the carriers in the region y > 0 lose their velocity pointing in the -y direction, which corresponds to suddenly ac-

eration of the streamlines in Fig. 5, that carriers acquire momentum in the same direction in the process of entering and leaving the superconducting region. Therefore, they have to acquire compensating momentum in the opposite direction in the process of traveling from one to the other end of the superconducting region.

trons spontaneously acquire the speed of the Meissner current when a system is cooled into the superconducting state [10], and also explains why electrons slow down when a rotating normal metal becomes superconducting [17], explains how streamlines acquire and lose their velocity perpendicular to the normal current flow as carriers enter and leave the superconductor. The situation discussed here shows the underlying physics more clearly than in the cases of the Meissner effect and the rotating superconductor, because the value of the magnetic field

The profile of streamlines is determined by London's equation, Ampere's law, and the boundary conditions. It is interesting to ask: what are the forces acting on carriers that make them flow along the streamlines?

Figure 10 shows the direction and magnitude (in arbitrary units) of the total force on carriers along a typical streamline in the region y > 0, z < 0. This force determines the time evolution of the carriers af ter the initial kick received by carriers when they enter the superconducting region, discussed in Sect. V. Note that the y component of the net force is negative, as required so that the total momentum transfer in the -y direction

The net force in Fig. 10 is the sum of generalized force F0 and magnetic Lorentz force FB, that are shown in Fig. 11. The scale of the forces in Fig. 11 is reduced by a factor of 3 with respect to Fig. 10. This means that the net force in Fig. 10 results from a net near cancellation of magnetic and generalized force in nearly opposite directions.
More generally the pattern of this generalized force is shown in Fig. 12. It can be seen that it pushes carriers out of the superconducting region towards the nearest boundary. It is associated with the current pattern and becomes very small in the interior where the current is small.

The physical origin of these non-magnetic forces is not clear. If part or all of F0 is electric, it implies that there is some charge redistribution in the interior of superconductors carrying a current. The potential that gives rise to the force F0 (Eq. (33)) is called the Bernoulli potential. Various explanations for its origin within the conventional theory of superconductivity are discussed in ref. [18].

VII. ALFVEN'S THEOREM

VIII. TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE

Figures 1 and 4 show qualitatively that magnetic field lines are carried along with the streamlines, as determined by Alfven's theorem. Let us examine this question quantitatively. The convective time derivative of the magnetic field, following the motion of the streamlines, is given by

dB dt

We have

which follows immediately from Ampere's law Eq. (11). Therefore,

dB dt

for the stationary flow depicted in Fig. 4. This means that the value of the magnetic field does not change along a streamline, it stays constant at its normal state value:

(43)

If the current flowing in the normal state is very small, upon cooling the system will enter the superconducting state at a temperature close to the critical temperature Tc, and the London penetration depth will be a significant fraction of the sample's dimensions.
Consider for example a cylindrical wire of radius 1mm, carrying a current I = 1µA. This corresponds to a current density

For Hc(0) = 1000G, L(0) = 500°A Eq. (52) yields

(53)

So with those parameters, the system will enter the superconducting state at a temperature close to Tc with a London penetration depth that is of order half of the system half-width. Upon cooling further, the London penetration depth will rapidly decrease.
Figure 13 shows the evolution of streamlines as the temperature is lowered under those conditions. The magnetic field, not shown in Fig. 13, follows the behavior of the streamlines, as shown quantitatively in Sect. VI and qualitatively in Fig. 4. It moves out together with the streamlines.
Figure 13 shows that as the system is cooled and enters deeper into the superconducting state, charge carriers carrying the current along the streamlines move towards the surface, and carry the magnetic field lines out with them. This clearly illustrates that Alfven's theorem governs the behavior of charges and magnetic fields in a superconducting wire.

FIG. 14: Streamlines for charge motion in the z direction in a cylindrical superconducting region -b  z  b, r  a, for a = 1, b = 2, L = 0.2
Figure 14 shows streamlines for a cylindrical wire of radius a = 1 and London penetration depth L = 0.2. They look qualitatively similar to the planar case, Fig. 5, except that the outward motion of streamlines is considerably less than in the planar case for given L. This follows simply from the fact that the magnetic field here Eq. (54) is half as large as for the planar case Eq. (12) for

10

the same distance to the central axis. Another important difference with the planar case is that here the magnetic field is not constant along streamlines. The material time derivative of the magnetic field is given by

Fig. 15 shows the value of the magnetic field along the streamlines shown in Fig. 14. It decreases, which means that magnetic field is being expelled even faster that expected from the motion of the charge carriers, unlike the situation in the planar geometry where the magnetic field is constant along the streamlines.

carriers. For a point far from the boundaries with the normal leads the velocity of carriers is given by

vs(r) = vz(r)z^ + vr(r)r^.

(63)

Initially when the system is in the normal state, vr = 0 and the current is uniform so that vz is independent of
r, hence  × vs = 0. The generalized vorticity Eq. (6) is given by

w(r, t

(64)

with B given by Eq. (54). Hence w(r, t = 0) = w(r, t = 0)^ = 0. When the system is in the superconducting
state, w(r) = 0 according to Eq. 8. The equation of motion for w is, from Eq. (7)

w(r, t) t

(65)

It shows that w cannot evolve from its initial nonzero value Eq. (64) to zero unless vr = 0, which means that there is necessarily radial motion of charge carriers during the process.

The extra factor of 2 compared to Eq. (59) is because the surface Sm shrinks as it moves together with the streamlines, as a consequence the flux through it decreases even faster.
In conclusion, we find that in a cylindrical wire the magnetic field lines move out even faster than the streamlines. Still, the motion of magnetic field lines is closely associated with the motion of charges.
We can also show analytically that when the wire carrying a current is cooled from the normal into the superconducting state there is a radial outflow of charge

It is generally stated that the difference between perfect conductors and superconductors is that the superconductor can only be in one single state for given external conditions, independent of history, while a perfect conductor can reach a variety of different states dependent of history, including the one that the superconductor adopts. We pointed out here that this is not so in the case of a wire. Instead, a perfectly conducting wire, no matter what the history, can never adopt the unique state that the superconducting wire carrying a current adopts. For this reason, analyzing the superconducting wire scenario can yield new insight beyond analyzing the situation where an external magnetic field is applied, in which case the superconducting and perfectly conducting bodies can reach the same state. Here we have shown that the wire scenario provides further evidence in support of the physics that we have proposed explains the Meissner effect [12].
Incidentally, we also note that according to the analysis in this paper, a `perfect conductor' is paradoxically unable to conduct any current unless it became perfectly conducting af ter the current started flowing. To our knowledge this has not been pointed out before [20].
The analysis of this paper confirms that there is fundamental physics missing in the conventional understanding of superconductivity. The notion that the motion of magnetic field lines in superconductors is tied to the motion of charge carriers is alien to both London theory [9] and to BCS theory [2, 21]. Within BCS theory magnetic field lines move spontaneously out in the Meissner effect with no outward motion of charge carriers. This

11

in appearance violates Faraday's law, Newton's law, and thermodynamic laws, as we pointed out in earlier work [12, 22, 23]. The dynamics of this process, and how it is able to circumvent these fundamental laws of physics, has not been addressed by BCS theory in the 64 years since its formulation, when it supposedly explained the Meissner effect [24].
In contrast, we have pointed out in this paper that for a superconducting wire carrying a current the motion of magnetic field lines is intimately tied to the motion of charge carriers, within BCS-London theory. Namely, the motion of magnetic field lines follows the motion of charge carriers in the streamlines, both as a function of position in the steady state, and as a function of temperature as the temperature is changed. This has been known for over 70 years [9], however its significance has not been appreciated.
The superconducting wire conducting current discussed here reveals key information about the physics of superconductivity. When normal carriers enter the superconducting region they experience a `kick' that changes their direction of flow towards the surface of the wire, as indicated by the discontinuity in the slope of the streamlines at the N-S boundaries shown in the figures. This follows directly from the solution of London's and Ampere's equations. This `kick' that transfers momentum to the carriers does not occur for a perfect conductor. It is a quantum effect that occurs when normal carriers form Cooper pairs as they enter the superconducting region and join the condensate. Similarly carriers experience a `kick' when they exit the superconducting region, i.e. transition from Cooper pairs to normal electrons. As discussed in Sect. V, the momentum acquired by the carriers in these processes is in direction orthogonal to the current flow and to the magnetic field and is directly proportional to the local magnitude of the magnetic field. The conclusion that it originates in the magnetic Lorentz force [14] is compelling. We have shown in Sect. V how it can be understood by the radial expansion and contraction of the orbit proposed within the theory of hole superconductivity, that also explains the Meissner effect and the behavior of rotating superconductors. Instead, BCS-London theory provides no physical explanation for how this momentum is acquired by the carriers entering and leaving the superconducting region.
It is natural to expect that the same physics takes place when carriers become superconducting in the Meissner effect, the rotating superconductor, and the superconducting wire. The London equation describes the phenomena, but does not provide a physical explanation for the processes. Instead, our theory provides a unified explanation for all these phenomena. The motion of charge carriers and magnetic field lines are intimately tied, as required by the laws of physics and in particular by Alfven's theorem. The dynamics of the processes is accounted for by fundamental physical laws, not left undetermined as done in BCS-London theory. The superconducting wire carrying a current provides a vivid illustration of this physics,

which is present but not apparent in the Meissner effect and the rotating superconductor.
The fact that charge carriers in superconductors experience changes in momentum that are not accounted for solely by electromagnetic forces was in fact pointed out long ago by A. V. Nikulov in the context of superconducting rings and flux quantization [25] and discussed by him and coworkers extensively over the years [26, 27]. The difference with the situation considered here (and in our work on the Meissner effect and rotating superconductors) is that we are dealing with macroscopic changes in momentum, in contrast with the situations considered by Nikulov and coworkers where the changes in momentum are microscopic. Nevertheless we believe it is likely that the physics discussed in our work also plays a role (that remains to be understood) in the puzzling phenomena studied theoretically and experimentally by Nikulov and coworkers [27].
