Abstract. As defined in [2], a Hausdorff space is strongly antiUrysohn (in short: SAU) if it has at least two non-isolated points and any two infinite closed subsets of it intersect. Our main result answers the two main questions of [2] by providing a ZFC construction of a locally countable SAU space of cardinality 2c. The construction hinges on the existence of 2c weak P-points in , a very deep result of Ken Kunen.
It remains open if SAU spaces of cardinality > 2c could exist, while it was shown in [2] that 22c is an upper bound. Also, we do not know if crowded SAU spaces, i.e. ones without any isolated points, exist in ZFC but we obtained the following consistency results concerning such spaces.
(1) It is consistent that c is as large as you wish and there is a locally countable and crowded SAU space of cardinality c+.
(2) It is consistent that both c and 2c are as large as you wish and there is a crowded SAU space of cardinality 2c.
(3) For any uncountable cardinal  the following statements are equivalent: (i)  = cof ([], ). (ii) There is a locally countable and crowded SAU space of size  in the generic extension obtained by adding  Cohen reals. (iii) There is a locally countable and countably compact T1-space of size  in some CCC generic extension.

1. Introduction
Anti-Urysohn (AU) and strongly anti-Urysohn (SAU) spaces were introduced and studied in [2]. An AU space is a Hausdorff space in which any two non-empty regular closed sets intersect and a SAU space is a Hausdorff space that has at least two non-isolated points and in which any two infinite closed sets intersect. Note that a non-singleton AU space has no isolated points, i.e. is crowded and a crowded SAU space is AU, this explains the terminology. Also, the requirement of having at least two non-isolated points is needed to exclude the trivial case of one-point compactifications of discrete spaces.
All relevant questions concerning AU spaces were settled in [2], in particular it was shown that for every infinite cardinal  there is an AU space of cardinality , but only inconclusive partial results were proved for SAU spaces. For instance, we could only construct consistent examples of SAU spaces, moreover all of them were of size  c, while only 22c was established as an upper bound for their cardinality.
This, of course, naturally led to the following two questions raised in [2]:

(1) Is there a SAU space in ZFC?

(2) Can there be a SAU space of cardinality greater than c?

Our main result answers affirmatively both of these questions, namely we shall present a ZFC example of a locally countable SAU space of cardinality 2c. It is easy to see that 2c is an upper bound for the sizes of locally countable SAU spaces, so this result is sharp. However, it remains an open question if 2c is an upper bound for the sizes of all SAU spaces. It was proved in [2] that 22c is such an upper bound.
It was proved in [2, Theorem 3.7] that r = c implies the existence of a locally countable and crowded SAU space of size  c, moreover several other forcing constructions yielded crowded SAU spaces. This then led to the question if the existence of a SAU space is equivalent to the existence of crowded ones.
By Theorem 2.7 this question can now be reformulated as follows: Is there a crowded SAU space in ZFC? Now, the method of construction of Theorem 2.7 yields a SAU space that is right-separated, i.e. scattered, hence it may not help to answer this question that we could not answer. However, we could get several partial results about it. We could prove the consistency of the existence of a locally countable and crowded SAU space of size  c+, moreover we proved that the equality  = cof ([], ) is equivalent to the existence of a locally countable

and crowded SAU space in the generic extension obtained by adding  Cohen reals.

2. A large SAU space in ZFC
The aim of this section is to present a construction that yields, in ZFC, a locally countable SAU space of cardinality 2c.We actually present a general construction of right-separated spaces that uses functions with values that are free filters. We start by fixing some notation and terminology.
For any infinite set S we write (S) to denote the collection of all free filters on S. As is customary, S  (S) denotes the family of all free ultrafilters on S.
Definition 2.1. Let  be an uncountable cardinal. We call a function  with domain  \  a nice filter assignment for  if for all    \  we have ()  (S) for some infinite subset S of . We shall denote by F() the family of all nice filter assignments for .
Note that S is simply the maximal member of (). Next we shall show how a nice filter assignment for  defines a natural topology on .
Definition 2.2. Let  be a nice filter assignment for  > . Then the topology  on  is defined by the formula
 = {G   :    G \  G  S  () }.
It is left to the reader to check that  is a T1 topology on , this is where considering only free filters is essential.
Since SAU spaces are Hausdorff by definition, we shall need a condition that will imply in case of a nice filter assignment  for  that  is Hausdoff. To formulate this condition, we shall use the following terminology that was introduced in [1].
Definition 2.3. The indexed family of filters {Fi : i  I} is called disjointly representable if there are sets {Ai  Fi : i  I} such that Ai  Aj =  whenever i, j  I and i = j.
Lemma 2.4. Let  be a nice filter assignment for  >  such that (i) S is countable for all    \ , (ii) {(i) : i  I} is disjointly representable for all countable I  \.
Then  is a Hausdoff topology.
Proof. Note first that all n   are isolated in . So, it suffices to show that distinct ,    \  have disjoint neighborhoods.

To see that, we set U0 = {} and V0 = {} and then define by recursion countable sets Un and Vn with Un  Vn =  as follows.
Given Un and Vn, we apply (ii) to the index set In = Un  Vn \  to obtain pairwise disjoint sets Ai  (i) for all i  In. Then we set Un+1 = Un  {Ai : i  Un} and similarly Vn+1 = Vn  {Ai : i  Vn}. Clearly, then both Un+1 and Vn+1 are countable by (i), moreover we also have Un+1  Vn+1 = . Now, it is obvious that U = {Un : n < }   and V = {Vn : n < }   are disjoint open neighborhoods of  and , completing the proof.
In view of this result it is natural to look for conditions that imply disjoint representability of certain countable families of filters. Here is a very simple such condition about families of ultrafilters on .
Proposition 2.5. A countable subfamily of  is disjointly representable iff it is a discrete subspace of , considered as the remainder of .
Proof. Indeed, this follows from the fact that in a regular space the points in a countable discrete subspace have pairwise disjoint neighborhoods, moreover for members of  this means that they have pairwise almost disjoint elements.
Contrary to this proposition, the following result needed in our construction of SAU spaces, is highly non-trivial. But, luckily for us, it is an immediate consequence of a deep result of Kunen in [4]. We recall that an ultrafilter u   is a weak P-point if u is not in the closure of any countable subset of its complement.
Theorem 2.6. The family U of all weak P-point ultrafilters in  has cardinality 2c, moreover all countable subfamilies of U are disjointly representable.
Proof. We have |U| = 2c by [4] and it is obvious that all countable subsets of U are discrete in , hence disjointly representable by Proposition 2.5.
We are now ready to present our main result.
Theorem 2.7. If  =   2c then there is a locally countable SAU space of cardinality .
Proof. To start with, we fix using Theorem 2.6 for every countably infinite set S   the family U(S) of size 2c of all weak P-point ultrafilters in S. Then all countable subfamilies of U(S) are disjointly representable. Also, if T  [S] then
U(T ) = {u  T : u  U(S) and T  u},

where u  T = {A  T : A  u}. In other words, u  T  belongs to U(T ) iff the ultrafilter u  S generated by u belongs to U(S). Indeed, this is because T  is clopen in S.
Next, using  =  we fix an enumeration { A, B :    < } of [] × [] such that S = A  B   for all    \ . We then pick, by transfinite recursion on    \ , weak P-points u  U(S) and v  U (S) such that A  u and B  v as follows.
Assume that    \  and u, v have been chosen for all    <  and then let us put
I = {   \  : A  S  u} and J = {   \  : B  S  v}.
For each   I then u  A generates a weak P-point ultrafilter u  U (S) and, similarly, for each   J, v  B generates a weak P-point ultrafilter v  U (S).
But we have on one hand |I  J| <   2c and, on the other hand, |U (S)| = |U (A)| = |U (B)| = 2c, so we may clearly choose distinct u, v  U (S) \ {u :   I}  {v :   J} such that A  u and B  v.
After having completed the recursion, we let
() = {U  V : U  u and V  v}
for each    \ . Clearly, then ()  (S), hence  is a nice filter assignment for . It is also clear from the definitions that each   \ is a common -accumulation point of both A and B, hence  turns out to be a SAU topology on  if we can prove that it is Hausdorff.
To see that, it suffices to show that for any I  [ \ ] the family {u, v :   I} is disjointly representable. Indeed, if
{U :   I}  {V :   I}
are pairwise disjoint sets with U  u and V  v then {U  V :   I} are pairwise disjoint as well. But this means that {() :   I} is disjointly representable for all countable I  \, hence  is Hausdorff by Lemma 2.4.
So, consider I  [ \ ] and put S = {S :   I}. For each   I then u generates a weak P-point u  U(S) and similarly v generates v  U(S), moreover by our recursive construction they are all distinct. Consequently, by Theorem 2.6 the family {u, v :   I} is disjointly representable, hence so is {u, v :   I}, completing the proof.

It is worth to mention that for   c the condition  =   2c in Theorem 2.7 is actually necessary to have a locally countable SAU

space of cardinality . Since SAU spaces are countably compact, this follows immediately from the following result.
Theorem 2.8. If X is a locally countable and countably compact T1space of cardinality  > c then  = .
Proof. Assume, on the contrary that  <  and let  be the smallest cardinal such that  > . It is well-known that then cf () = . But then by a classical result of Tarski in [6], there is an almost disjoint family A  [] with |A| =  > .
Since   , we may assume without any loss of generality that   X, hence every A  A has an accumulation point xA  X. But |A| >  then implies the existence of some B  A and x  X such that |B| >  and xA = x for all A  B. Let U be a countable neighbourhood of x, then A  U is infinite for all A  B which is impossible because B is almost disjoint with |B| >  > c.
Corollary 2.9. For c    2c there is a locally countable SAU space of cardinality  iff  = .
As was mentioned in the introduction, any locally countable SAU space X has cardinality  2c. Indeed, this is because it does have an infinite closed subset F of cardinality  2c, namely the closure of any subset of size . But local countability then implies that F is covered by an open set U with |U| = |F |  2c and the SAU property implies that X \ U is finite.
Finally, we mention the following accidental consequence of Theorem 2.7. In this, F (X) is the free set number and X denotes the Gmodification of the space X, see [3].
Corollary 2.10. The locally countable SAU space X of cardinality 2c of Theorem 2.7 is an example of a Hausdorff space with F (X) =  and F (X) = 2c.
Indeed, F (X) =  because every free sequence in a SAU space has order type <  + , while X is discrete. It was shown in [3] that for any Hausdorff space X with F (X) =  we have F (X)  22c and we do not know if this upper bound could be replaced by 2c, i.e. if Corollary 2.10 is sharp. It is curious that the same upper bound 22c is known for the size of any SAU space and the same problem arises if this could be improved to 2c.

3. Forcing "large" crowded SAU spaces
All the consistent examples of SAU spaces constructed in [2] were crowded but of cardinality  c. As mentioned above, we do not know

if crowded SAU spaces exist in ZFC but the aim of this section is to produce consistent examples of crowded SAU spaces of size > c.
By Theorem 3.7 of [2], the assumption r = c implies the existence of a locally countable and crowded SAU space of cardinality c. Our next result says that, under the same assumption r = c together with c = 2<c, a forcing construction yields a generic extension of the ground model in which there is a locally countable and crowded SAU space of cardinality c+.
Theorem 3.1. If r = c = 2<c then we have a c-closed and c+ - CC notion of forcing P such that, in the generic extension V P, there is a locally countable and crowded SAU space of cardinality c+.
Proof. Our aim is to obtain a function U : c+  [c+] in V P such that   U() for each   c+ and {U() :   c+} generates a SAU topology on c+. Our conditions then will be approximations to U of size < c with some "side conditions" that will ensure that any two infinite subsets of c+ have a common accumulation point. Hausdorffness of  will follow from the assumption r = c and genericity.
Now we define the notion of forcing P = P,  . The elements of P will be pairs of the form p = Up, Cp , where Up is a function with domain Ap  [c+]<c and values taken in [Ap] such that   Ap and Up(n) =  for all n  , moreover   U()   + 1 if   Ap \ .
Then {U() :   Ap} as a subbase generates a topology p on Ap that is required to be crowded, i.e. we assume that all non-empty members of p are infinite. To handle this, we define
Bp,I = {Up() :   I}
for any finite subset I of Ap. Then
Bp = {Bp,I : I  [Ap]<} \ {}
is a base for p, hence our assumption just means that all members of Bp are infinite.
For any x  Ap we shall denote by acp(x) the family of all sets C  [Ap] such that x is a p-accumulation point of C, i.e. every pneighborhood of x has infinite intersection with C. Now, the second co-ordinate Cp of the condition p is also a function with domain Ap but such that Cp(x)  [acp(x)]<c for x  Ap.
Next we define the partial order  on P by the following stipulations:
Definition 3.2. For p, q  P we have p  q, i.e. p is a stronger condition than q iff
(a) Up  Uq and

8

(b) Cp(x)  Cq(x) for all x  Aq.
We may reformulate item (a) above as follows: Ap  Aq and Up(x) = Uq(x) for all x  Aq. Note that this implies Bp,I = Bq,I for all I  [Aq]<. Also, it should be noted that in item (b) it is implicit that every C  Cq(x) accumulates to x in the topology p as well.
We next present several lemmas concerning the forcing P which together will yield the desired function U : c+  [c+] in V P.
Lemma 3.3. The forcing P is c-closed.
Proof of 3.3. Assume that p :  <  is a decreasing -sequence in P, where p = U, C for  <  and  < c is an infinite regular cardinal. (To enhance readability, we use the 's instead of the p's as indeces.) We may then define a lower bound p = Up, Cp for the p's as follows.
(1) Up = < U, hence Ap = < A, and
(2) Cp(x) = {C(x) : x  A} for any x  Ap. To see that p  P , first note that c = 2<c implies that c is regular, hence we have both |Ap| < c and |Cp(x)| < c for any x  Ap. That p is crowded follows from the fact that Bp = < B. It remains to check that for any C  C(x) we have C  acp(x), and that is clear because then C  ac(x) for all    \  and every B  Bp eventually belongs to B as well.
Our next lemma is an amalgamation result that will imply the c+ - CC-property of P.
Lemma 3.4. Assume that p, q  P are such that Ap  Aq < ApAq, otp(Ap) = otp(Aq), and for the unique order isomorphism  : Ap  Aq between them we have, for all   Ap, that
(i) Uq(()) = Up(), and
(ii) Cq(()) = {[C] : C  Cp()}.
Then p and q are compatible in P.
Proof of 3.4. Let us note first that, as  is the identity on Ap  Aq < ApAq, we have Up() = Uq() for all   Ap  Aq by (i), hence Ur = Up  Uq is a well-defined map on Ar = Ap  Aq. We claim that if we set Cr(x) = Cp(x)  Cq(x) for x  Ap  Aq, moreover Cr(x) = Cp(x) for x  Ap \ Aq and similarly Cr(x) = Cq(x) for x  Aq \ Ap then r = Ur, Cr is a common extension of p and q in P.
To see that r  P , the only non-trivial thing to check is that Cr(x)  acr(x) for any x  Ap  Aq. This, however, is clear because Ur(x) = Up(x) = Uq(x)  x + 1 and hence C  acr(x) iff C  x  acr(x),

LARGE STRONGLY ANTI-URYSOHN SPACES EXIST

moreover  is the identity on Ar  x = Ap  x = Aq  x. Now, that r extends both p and q is obvious.
Using our assumption c = 2<c, standard counting and delta-system arguments imply that every subset Q of P with |Q| = c+ contains two elements p, q  Q that satisfy the conditions of Lemma 3.4, and hence are compatible. Consequently, P is indeed c+ - CC.
It is an immediate consequence of the above results that we have cV = cV P and (c+)V = (c+)V P.
Lemma 3.5. For every condition q  P and   c+ \  there is p  q such that   Ap.
Proof of 3.5. Indeed, if  / Aq then let Ap = Aq  {} and extend Uq to Ap by putting Up() =   {}. Also, we extend Cq by letting Cp() = . It is obvious then that p = Up, Cp is as required.
It immediately follows that if G  P is P-generic over V then U = {Up : p  G} maps c+ into [c+] and the (obviously locally countable) topology  generated by the range of U is crowded because
B = {Bp : p  G}  [c+]
forms a base for  . We still have to work to show that  is SAU. The Hausdorff property
of  immediately follow from the following result.
Lemma 3.6. For every condition q  P and distinct ,   Aq there is p  q such that for some ,   Ap we have   Up(),   Up() and Up()  Up() = .
Proof of 3.6. Start by fixing a countable q-open set W containing both  and , e.g. W = Uq()  Uq() will work. For every x  W consider the following two subfamilies of [W ]:
Bx = {B  Bq : x  B  W }, Ax = {B  C : B  Bx and C  Cq(x)}.
Then we have |Ax  Bx| < c and hence for A = {Ax : x  W } and B = {Bx : x  W } we have |A  B| < c as well.
We may thus apply our assumption r = c to the family AB  [W ] to obtain a partition W = E  F of W such that |E  A| = |F  A| =  for all A  A and |E  B| = |F  B| =  for all B  B. Without loss of generality, we may also assume that   E and   F .
Let us now choose ,   c+ such that Aq <  < , and extend Uq to Ap = Aq {, } by putting Up() = E {} and Up() = F {}. It is clear from our choice of E and F that p is crowded and Cq(x)  acp(x) for all x  Aq. Consequently, if we extend Cq(x) to Ap by putting Cp() = Cp() =  then p = Up, Cp  P is as required.

Now, it is trivial from Lemma 3.6 that the generic topology  in V [G] is Hausdorff. Our next lemma will imply the only missing thing required to show that  is SAU, namely that any two infinite  -closed sets intersect.
Lemma 3.7. Given any condition q  P and two countably infinite sets C, D  [Aq], there is p  q such that both C and D belong to Cp(x) for some x  Ap.
Proof of 3.7. As in the previous proof, we start by fixing a countable q-open set W such that C  D  W . Then we choose   c+ such that Aq <  and extend Uq to Ap = Aq  {} by putting Up() = W  {}. We also extend Cq(x) to Ap by putting Cp() = {C, D}. It is trivial that then p = Up, Cp  P and p  q, completing the proof.
As a corollary we have that the generic topology  is SAU. Indeed, for any two sets C, D  [c+], putting together Lemmas 3.3, 3.5, and 3.7 we may conclude that
{p  P : C  D  Ap and  x  Ap {C, D}  acp(x)}
is dense in P. But clearly if {C, D}  acp(x) then p forces {C, D}  ac (x) and so cl (C)  cl (D) =  as well. Thus the proof of Theorem 3.1 is completed.

We do not know if the above result is (consistently) sharp, i.e. if c+ could be replaced by, say, 2c. our next theorem shows that this is possible if we give up local countability. Also, the assumption r = c in the ground model is strengthened to r = c, where r is defined to be the smallest cardinal  such that there is a family A of infinite sets that cannot be reaped (or bisected) by a single set. So, r = c just says that any family A of infinite sets with |A| < c can be reaped. Clearly, we have  < r  r  c, moreover r < r = c is consistent.
Theorem 3.8. If r = c = 2<c then there is a c-closed and c+ - CC notion of forcing P such that, in the generic extension V P, there is a crowded SAU space of cardinality (2c)V = (2c)V P.
Proof. To simplify notation, we shall write  = 2c in what follows. Similarly as in the proof of Theorem 3.1, our aim is then to force a function U :   P() such that   U() for all    and the topology  generated by the range {U() :   } of U on  is a crowded SAU space. The notion of forcing P = P,  will also be quite similar to the one used there.
The elements of P will be pairs of the form p = Up, Cp , where Up is a function with domain Ap  [c+]<c with values taken in P(Ap)

LARGE STRONGLY ANTI-URYSOHN SPACES EXIST

11

such that   U() for all   Ap, moreover the second co-ordinate Cp of the condition p is also a function with domain Ap but such that Cp(x)  [acp(x)]<c for x  Ap. Here we are freely using the analogs of the pieces of notation from the above proof of 3.1, so acp(x) denotes the family of all countable subsets of Ap that accumulate to x in the topology p generated by the range of Up on Ap. Also, we shall use the notation Bp,I = {Up() :   I} for I  [Ap]< to obtain the base
Bp = {Bp,I : I  [Ap]<} \ {}
for p. Next we define the partial order  on P that, as far as the first
co-ordinate is concerned, is quite different from the corresponding part of 3.2.
Definition 3.9. For p, q  P we have p  q, i.e. p is a stronger condition than q iff
(a) Ap  Aq and for every   Aq we have Aq  Up() = Uq(); (b) Uq()  Uq() =  implies Up()  Up() =  for any ,   Aq; (c) Cp(x)  Cq(x) for all x  Aq.
It is obvious that  is indeed a partial order on P . We next present a series of lemmas that will help us prove the required properties of the forcing P.
Lemma 3.10. The forcing P is c-closed.
Proof of 3.10. Assume that p :  <  is a decreasing -sequence in P, where p = U, C for  <  and  < c is an infinite regular cardinal. We may then define a lower bound p = Up, Cp for the p's as follows.
(1) Ap = < A, and Up() = {U() :    < }, where  = min{ :   A}.
(2) Cp(x) = {C(x) : x  A} for any x  Ap. Since c is regular, we have both |Ap| < c and |Cp| < c. For any  <  and C  C(x) we have C  acp(x) because then C  ac(x) for all    \  and every B  Bp eventually belongs to B as well. Thus we have p  P . The easy verification of p  p for all  <  is left to the reader.
As in the proof of 3.4, we next give an amalgamation result that will imply the c+ - CC property of P.
Lemma 3.11. Assume that p, q  P are isomorphic conditions, i.e. otp(Ap) = otp(Aq), the unique order isomorphism  : Ap  Aq is the identity on A = Ap  Aq, moreover for all   Ap we have

12

I. JUHÁSZ, S. SHELAH, L. SOUKUP, AND Z. SZENTMIKLÓSSY

(i) Uq(()) = Up(), and
(ii) Cq(()) = {[C] : C  Cp()}.
Then p and q are compatible in P.
Proof of 3.11. We define the desired common extension r = Ur, Cr of p and q by the following stipulations:
(a) Ur(x) = Ur((x)) = Up(x)  Uq((x)) for x  Ap;
(b) Cr(x) = Cr((x)) = Cp(x)  Cq((x)) for x  Ap.
As  is the identity on A, both functions Ur and Cr are well-defined on Ar = Ap  Aq.
To see that r  P , we have to check that Cr(x)  acr(x) for all x  Ar. By symmetry, it suffices to do this for x  Ap. In view of conditions (ii) and (b), what we have to show is that x  B  Br implies |B  C| = |B  [C]| =  for any C  Cp(x). Now, any member of Br is of the form
Br,IJ = {Ur(i) : i  I}  {Ur(j) : j  J}
with I  [Ap]< and J  [Aq]<. It is easy to compute from condition (a) that we have
Br,IJ = Bp,I-1[J]  Bq,[I]J ,
moreover Bq,[I]J = [Bp,I-1[J]]. Then x  Br,IJ implies x  Bp,I-1[J], hence |C  Bp,I-1[J]| = ,
consequently, then |[C]Bq,[I]J| =  as well. But this clearly implies
|Br,IJ  C| = |Br,IJ  [C]| = ,
just as we claimed. To see that r is a common extension of p and q, by symmetry again,
it suffices to show r  p. Clearly, only condition (b) of 3.9 requires any checking for this. But as  is an isomorphism, Up(x)  Up(y) =  implies Uq((x))  Uq((y)) = , moreover Up(x)  A = Uq((x))  A and Up(y)  A = Uq((y))  A, we indeed have Ur(x)  Ur(y) = .
Since c = 2<c, standard counting and delta-system arguments imply that every subset Q of P with |Q| = c+ contains two isomorphic elements p, q  Q that satisfy the conditions of Lemma 3.11, and hence are compatible. Consequently, P is indeed c+ - CC.
It is an immediate consequence of the above results that we have cV = cV P, moreover by counting nice names we also may conclude (2c)V =  = (2c)V P.
We also have the following immediate consequence of Lemma 3.11 which will be used to show that the generic topology  is (very) crowded.

Lemma 3.12. For every  <  the set of conditions
D = {r  P :  B  Br (B \  = )}
is dense in P.
Proof of 3.12. Since cf () > c, the domain Ap of any condition p  P is bounded in . So we can pick q  P isomorphic to p such that Aq > {}  Ap. Now, let r be the common extension of p and q constructed in Lemma 3.11. Then, as we have seen,
Br = {B  [B] : B  Bp},
where  is the unique order isomorphism from Ap to Aq. Thus we clearly have p  r  D.
That the generic map U is defined on all of , follows from the following trivial lemma.
Lemma 3.13. For every  <  the set of conditions E = {p  P :   Ap} is dense in P.
Proof of 3.13. Indeed, if q  P and  / Aq then define p = Up, Cp as follows: Let Ap = Aq  {}, Up(x) = Uq(x) and Cp(x) = Cq(x) for x  Aq, moreover Up() = Ap and Cp() = . Then p  q and p  E.
It immediately follows from Lemma 3.13 that if G is P-generic over V then putting U() = {Up() : p  G  E} for all  < , then U :   P() is well-defined in V [G], hence so is the topology  generated by the range of U. It is also clear that if B is the base of  consisting of all non-empty finite intersections of the subbase {U() :  < } then every member of B is cofinal in , hence  is crowded. Indeed, fix  <  and assume that BI = {U (i) : i  I} =  for some I  []<. By lemmas 3.13 and 3.12 there is p  G  D such that I  Ap and Bp,I  Bp. But then Bp,I  BI implies BI \  = , so BI is indeed cofinal in .
Our next result is used to show that the generic topology  is Hausdorff.
Lemma 3.14. For distinct ,    the set of conditions D(, ) consisting of all p  P such that for some ,   Ap we have   Up(),   Up(), and Up()  Up() =  is dense in P.
Proof of 3.14. By Lemma 3.13 it suffices to show that any q  P with ,   Aq has an extension in D(, ). For every x  Aq consider the following family of infinite sets:
Ax = {B  C : x  B  Bq and C  Cq(x)}  [Aq].

Then we have |Ax| < c and hence, as c is regular, |A| < c as well. We may thus apply our assumption r = c to A  [Aq] to obtain a
partition Aq = E  F of Aq such that |E  A| = |F  A| =  for all A  A. Without loss of generality, we may also assume that   E and   F .
Let us now choose distinct ,    \ Aq and define p  P as follows. Put Ap = Aq  {, }, for x  Aq set Up(x) = Uq(x) and Cp(x) = Cq(x), moreover Up() = E  {}, Up() = F  {} and, finally, Cp() = Cp() = . It is clear from our choice of E and F that Cp(x)  acp(x) for all x  Aq. It trivially follows then that p = Up, Cp  D(, ) and p  q.
It is obvious from condition (b) of Definition 3.9 that every p  D(, ) forces U()  U() = , hence  is indeed Hausdorff. Our last result will finish our proof by implying that  is SAU.
Lemma 3.15. For any two sets C, D  [] the set of conditions
E(C, D) = {p  P : C  D  Ap and  x  Ap {C, D}  acp(x)}
is dense in P.
Proof of 3.15. By Lemmas 3.10 and 3.13 it suffices to show that any q  P with C  D  Aq has an extension in E(C, D). To see that, pick    \ Aq and define p  P as follows. First, set Ap = Aq  {}, for x  Aq set Up(x) = Uq(x) and Cp(x) = Cq(x). We also set Up() = {}  Aq and Cp() = {C, D}. Then the only member of Bp containing  is Ap, hence we trivially have Cp()  acp(). We thus have p = Up, Cp  E(C, D) and p  q, completing the proof.
Since every condition p  E(C, D) clearly forces cl (C)  cl (D) = , it immediately follows that  is indeed SAU.

4. Crowded SAU spaces from Cohen reals
In the previous section, with considerable effort, we presented consistent examples of crowded SAU spaces of size > c. In this section we show that to obtain such examples of size  c is much easier, in fact, we can get them by simply adding Cohen reals.
To fix our notation, we shall denote by CI the standard Cohen forcing CI = F n(I, 2),  ,
using the notation of [5]. Before turning to this promised result, we formulate and prove the following technical lemma.

Lemma 4.1. Assume that cof ([], ) = , moreover  is a crowded and locally countable Hausdorff topology on a set X of cardinality  with X   = . Then there is a crowded and locally countable Hausdorff topology  on Z = X   in V C such that
(1)   ;
(2) X  cl(A) = cl (A) for every A  V  [X]; (3) cl(C)  cl(D) =  for any two C, D  V  [X].
Proof. 4.1 Since X is locally countable, every countable subset of X is included in a countable  -open set, hence by cof ([], ) =  we can fix U = {U :   }    [X] that is cofinal in [X]. For each    we also fix an -type one-one enumeration {x,n : n < } of U.
Let G be C-generic over V and g = G :   2 be the corresponding Cohen generic map. For every  <  we then define
W = {}  {x,n : g( ·  + n) = 1}.
We claim that the topology  generated in V [G] on Z by the subbase
  {W :  < }  {T = Z \ W :  < }
is as required. That  is locally countable follows because W  U for all  < .
To see that it is crowded, consider any non-empty basic open set of the form B = U  WI  TJ where |U | = , WI = {Wi : i  I} and TJ = {Tj : j  J} with I, J  []<. Let H = U  {Ui : i  I}. Now  = B  H implies that H is infinite because X is crowded. This yields, by genericity, that |B| =  as well.
To check that  is Hausdorff, consider first  =   . In this case W and Z \ W are clearly their disjoint neighborhoods. If x  X and    then |{ : x  U}| =  implies that for every condition q  F n(, 2) there is  =  with x = x,n  U and
[ · ,  ·  + )  dom(q) = .
Now, if p extends q so that p( ·  + n) = 1 then p forces x  W and   Z \ W. Finally, there is nothing to prove if x = y  X because    is Hausdorff.
It remains to prove (1), (2) and (3). Now, (1) holds by definition. To check (2), consider any x  cl (A) for some A  V  [X] and x  B = U  WI  TJ . Let H = U  {Ui : i  I  J}, then x  H   . We may assume that x / A, hence |H A| = . So, given any condition q  F n(, 2), there is y  H  A such that for every i  I  J with y = xi,ni we have  ·i+ni / dom(q). Consequently, we may extend q to p  F n(, 2) so that p( ·i+ni) = 1 whenever i  I and p( ·i+ni) = 0

whenever i  J. But then p clearly forces y  B, hence B  A =  as well.
Finally, since for any C, D  V  [X] there is  <  with C  D  U, to prove (3), it clearly suffices to show that   cl(A) whenever A  V  [U]. To see this, note first that the sets of the form
B,I = {W \ Wi}
iI
constitute a -neighborhood base at , where  / I  []<. For any condition q  F n(, 2) there is x = x,n  A such that  ·  + n / dom(q) and for every i  I if x = xi,ni  Ui then  · i + ni / dom(q). So, we may extend q to p  F n(, 2) so that p( ·  + n) = 1 and p( · i + ni) = 0 whenever x  Ui for some i  I. But then p forces x  B,I, hence A  B,I = , completing the proof.
From Lemma 4.1 the following result is easily deduced.
Theorem 4.2. Assume that W is a model of ZFC, V :  < 1 is an increasing sequence of ZFC submodels in W , (1)V0 = (1)W , and   V0 is a cardinal such that
([])W = ([])V
<1
and cof ([], ) =  holds in all the V's. Assume also that V+1 contains a C-generic filter G over V for every  < 1. Then there is a crowded locally countable SAU space of cardinality  in W .
Proof. To start with, we fix a crowded locally countable space X0, 0  V0 of cardinality  such that X0 (1 ×) = . By transfinite recursion on   1 we then define crowded locally countable topologies   V on X =  ×  as follows.
To obtain +1 from , we apply Lemma 4.1 to get a crowded locally countable topology   V [G]  V+1 on X+1 = X  ({} × ) with properties (1) - (3) applied to X and {} ×  instead of X and . Then +1 is the topology generated by  on X+1 in V+1. For  limit we simply let  be the topology on X generated by <  on X in V+1.
Now, it is straight forward to check that 1 is a crowded locally countable topology on X1 in the final model W . The topology is SAU because if A, B  [X1]  W then there is  < 1 with A, B  [X]  V, and so A and B have a common accumulation point in X+1. Then x is a common accumulation point in X1 as well.
While it is an immediate corollary of Theorem 4.2 that the equality cof ([], ) =  implies the existence of a crowded locally countable

SAU space of cardinality  in the generic extension obtained by adding  >  Cohen reals, it may be somewhat surprising that the two statements are actually equivalent.
Theorem 4.3. For any uncountable cardinal  TFAE: (i) cof ([], ) = . (ii) There is a crowded locally countable SAU space in V C.
(iii) There is a locally countable and countably compact T1-space in some CCC generic extension W of V .
Proof. Since (i)  (ii) is implied by Theorem 4.2 and (ii)  (iii) is trivial, it suffices to show that (iii)  (i).
We first note that if X is a locally countable and countably compact T1-space of cardinality  >  then, choosing a countable neighbourhood Ux of every non-isolated point x  X, the family
U = {Ux : x  X}  [X]
has the property that for every A  [X] there is Ux  U with |AUx| = , i.e. U is -hitting.
Now, it is well-known that if  >  then the existence of an -hitting family H of size  in [] implies that of a cofinal family of size  in []. Indeed, we may then take H with |H| =  that is -hitting in []< and then {H : H  H} is cofinal in []. This is because if
A = {i : i < }  [] and SA = {i : i < n} : n <  ,
then |H  SA| =  implies A  H. Thus (iii) implies that cof ([], ) =  holds in W , but this, in turn,
implies the same in V because for any set A  W with A  V there is B  V such that A  B and |A| = |B|.
It is easy to see that r  r   holds in V C, moreover Theorem 3.7. of [2] as well as Theorem 3.1 above used the assumption r = c to obtain `"large" crowded locally countable SAU spaces. This lead us to raise the question if one could get such spaces when r is small. Our last result gives an affirmative answer to this question.
Theorem 4.4. There are models of ZFC containing crowded locally countable SAU spaces of cardinality c in which r = 1 but c is arbitrarily large.
Proof. To get such a model we first fix a cardinal  =  in the ground model and then will do a finite support iteration P :   1 of length 1 of CCC forcings where P+1 = C  Q for any  < 1. Then, independently of the choice of the Q's, we get from Theorem 4.2 that

18

a crowded locally countable SAU space of cardinality c =  exists in the final model W = V . P1
The posets Q will be obtained together with ultrafilters u   in V P by recursion so that  <  < 1 implies u  u. Our u0 is an arbitrary free ultrafilter on  in the ground model and for  limit we take u  {u :  < }. Once we have u, we let Q be the standard CCC, in fact even -centered, partial order that adds an infinite pseudo-intersection S of u.
Then u = {u :  < 1} is a free ultrafilter on  in the final model W = V P1 that is generated by the family
{S :  < 1}  { \ a : a  []<}.
Thus W actually satisfies u = r = 1, see [5, V.4.27] for more details.
