Working in the framework of generalized statistics, the problem of availability of the third law of thermodynamics in the black hole physics is studied by focusing on Schwarzschild black hole which easily and clearly exposes the violation of this law in common the approach based on Bekenstein entropy. Additionally, it is addressed that some inconsistencies between the predictions of quantum field theory and those of thermodynamics on the black hole temperature may be reconciled by using the thermodynamics laws in order to broaden energy definition. It claims that thermodynamics should be employed as a powerful tool in looking for more comprehensive energy definitions in high energy physics, still mysterious.

I. INTRODUCTION

The third law of thermodynamics states that the en-

tropy of a system should approach a constant value

(C) at absolute zero temperature, or equally S(T 

0)  C. Bekenstein entropy (SB) is proportional to

the horizon area (A = 4rh2), and correspondingly, for

a Schwarzschild black hole of mass M ( E) and Hawk-

ing

temperature

TH

for

which

rh

= 2M

and

T

= TH ,

we

have

,

(1)

in the units of c = = kB = G = 1, where kB denotes the Boltzmann constant. It clearly indicates that the third law of thermodynamics is not satisfied or briefly, TH  0( M  )  SB  . Although we considered Schwarzschild black hole, the behavior of SB T (M 
)  0   is common in other black holes such as Kerr-Newman and Reissner-Nordstr¨om metrics [1­5].
SB is non-extensive, a trait which reminds the generalized statistics such as Tsallis statistics [6, 7] including entropies which are not extensive. Indeed, as gravitational systems include long-range interaction (gravity), it is proposed that the Boltzmann entropy (leading to Eq. (1)) should be replaced with generalized entropies which leads to substantial consequences in both gravita-

tional and cosmological setups (see for example Refs. [8­ 16] their references and citations). It also seems that there is a connection between deviation of Boltzmann statistics and quantum features of gravity [16­20].
Our first aim is to study the possibility of satisfying the third law by employing some new entropies proposed that provide respectable solutions in cosmological and gravitational setups. Hereof and in subsequent sections, we respectively study the problem by considering Tsallis and Cirto entropy, Tsallis entropy and Kaniadakis entropy. Throughout the survey, we also address a thermodynamic energy definition for a black hole of mass M , corresponding to each entropy, which admits Hawking temperature. The black hole remnant and its decay time in mentioned entropy formalisms have been studied in fifth section. The last section is also devoted to summary.

II. TSALLIS AND CIRTO ENTROPY AND THE THIRD LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
Motivated by the non-extensivity of SB, and also the long-range nature of gravity, Tsallis and Cirto [8] introduce a new entropy for black holes as

ST = A,

(2)

where  and  are two unknown free constants evaluated by other parts of physics or observations. It is also useful to note here that this form of entropy is also supported in the framework of quantum gravity [20]. It means that two different approaches and motivations lead to the same result which increases the credit of this new proposal for the black hole entropy. Moreover, the equality of results can be considered as the sign of a deep

2

connection between non-extensivity and quantum grav-

ity helping us build a relation between their parameters,

a result noted in Refs. [17, 18]. Considering rh = 2M

and T

one

easily

finds

that

the

third

law

of

thermodynamics

is

met

whenever

0

<



<

1 2

,

and in summary, ST  0 M  0 T  0.

Now,

let

us

employ

Hawking

temperature

(TH

=

1 8M

)

instead of T

=

M ST

which leads to ST

 T -2

meaning

that the third law is fulfilled only if  < 0 and for this

case, we briefly have M   ST , T  0. In Tsallis

statistics, an intrinsic temperature discrepancy between

real temperature and the temperature obtained by ther-

modynamic relation may emerge depending on the ex-

pectation values definition (averaging methods) used in

obtaining quantities such as energy [21], and only, having

in hand the system temperature, one can decide on true

temperature [21]. Therefore, the above obtained tem-

perature discrepancy may be more understandable by

bearing in mind the intrinsic temperature discrepancy

of Tsallis statistics. Consequently, since  is a free pa-

rameter estimated from observations [6, 7] or probably

other parts of physics [17, 18], we cannot go further in

choosing one of these temperatures, and thus the cor-

responding thermodynamics, unless we enclasp detailed

observations, data and info on black holes.

Of course, a way to reconcile the above inconsistency

between temperatures is to redefine energy. In both cases

above, we assumed E = M , while if we assume T = TH =

E S

,

and

use

Eq.

(2),

then

we

reach

ET =

M 1 ST dm, 0 8m m

(3)

finally leading to

ET

=

4 (4)-1 M 2-1, 2 - 1

(4)

as the energy of a Schwarzschild black hole of mass M

in Tsallis formalism which recovers E = M by inserting



=

1

and



=

1 4

(the

Bekenstein

limit).

It

is

also

obvious

that

ET

is

positive

if



>

1 2

or



<

0.

For

the



>

1 2

case,

the third law is not satisfied and we face a situation like

to what we obtained in the case of Bekenstein entropy (i.

e, TH  0 SB, M, ET  ). The third law is met for  < 0 and in parallel ET  0 or briefly, ET , ST , T  0

M  .

Finally, we think that since the Hawking temperature

is also supported by other parts of physics such as quan-

tum field theory in curved spacetime and so on [22­24],

and as there is not any common agreement on the energy

definition in high energy physics [25, 26], it is probably

reasonable to rely on this approach compared to the two

previously mentioned cases. The latter means that ther-

modynamics may be used to find a more proper energy

definition in high energy physics.

In summary, we obtained 3 cases recaped as

where the third law is satisfied for the first case when

III. TSALLIS ENTROPY AND THE THIRD LAW
Recently, focusing on the relation between Tsallis and Boltzmann statistics, a new entropy has been derived for black holes as [13]

1

Sq

=

1-

[exp q

(1 - q)SB

- 1]

=

2

exp(

(1-q)SB 2

)

sinh

(1 - q)SB

,

(6)

(1 - q)

2

where q is a free unknown parameter and this result is also confirmed by calculating the Tsallis entropy content of black holes in the framework of quantum gravity [13, 19]. Following the recipe of previous section, if we assume E = M then we have

E T=
Sq

= TH exp

(q - 1)4M 2

,

(7)

which recovers TH whenever q = 1 (the Bekenstein limit

of (6) [13]). Briefly, T  0 only if q < 1, and in this

manner M, Sq   meaning that the third law is not

satisfied. On the other hand, if we assume T = TH (case

ii), then we see that the third law is satisfied only if

q > 1, or briefly M    Sq(T  0)  0. For the

case

iii,

where

T

= TH

=

1 8M

=

Eq Sq

,

we

reach

M

Eq = exp (1 - q)4m2 dm,

(8)

0

as the energy content of a black hole of mass M . Clearly,

the third law is again satisfied only if q > 1 and moreover,

E=

M 0

dm

=

M

is

recovered

at

the

limit

of

q

The above integration can be performed with the solution

given as



erf 2 M q - 1

Eq =

(9)

in which erf(x) denotes the error function [27].

IV. KANIADAKIS ENTROPY AND THE THIRD LAW
Kaniadakis entropy of a black hole is also reported as [13]

1

S =  sinh SB ,

(10)

where  is an unknown parameter evaluated by observations and probably, the other parts of physics [13]. Here, simple calculations lead to

E T= =

TH

,

(11)

S cosh(SB)

for the i-th case. The result indicates that, independent
of the value of , the third law is not satisfied (S   M   T  0). For the second case (T = TH , E = M ), we can write

1



S =  sinh 16T 2 ,

(12)

which shows the third law is satisfied only if  < 0. If  < 0, then the third law is also met for case iii, where T = TH and energy content of black hole is obtainable by using

M

E =

cosh(4m2)dm,

(13)

0

which recovers the E =

at

V. BLACK BODY RADIATION AND BLACK HOLE EVAPORATION
In the framework of common statistical mechanics based on Gibbs entropy, the black hole evaporation is described by Stefan-Boltzmann (SB) formula [28, 29]. As

it is apparent from Eq. (1), we have SB, M   when T  0 meaning that we face a catastrophe [29]. This result can be summarized in the language of SB law as

dM = -AT 4,

(16)

dt

where the ordinary energy definition (E = M ) is used

and

(=

2 60

in

our

units

[30,

31])

denotes

the

SB

constant

[29]. Here, minus sign is also due to the fact that Eq. (16)

explains the amount of energy that system loses it. It

clearly

shows

that

the

decay

rate

(

dM dt

)

diverges

as

M

(T ) approaches zero (infinity) [29]. Another consequence

of this law is our ability to find the decay time  as

1 0 dm (8)3 M 3

 =- 

M AT 4 =

, 3

(17)

and therefore   M 3 for a Schwarzschild black hole of

temperature TH . Eq. (17) also indicates that

[29].

A. Tsallis and Cirto (TC) black hole
Black body radiation has not been studied in the formalism of Eq. (2), but as we mentioned, this entropy is also confirmed by quantum gravity [20]. The latter allows us to use the black body radiation formula in the framework of quantum gravity to study the black holes meeting Eq. (2). The modifications of quantum gravity on the black body spectrum have recently been studied by some authors in different bases [32­35]. A common feature of quantum gravity scenarios is generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) that motivates us to focus on its modification on black body radiation. Indeed, such a modification is also obtainable by using other quantum gravity scenarios [33, 34].
In this regard, it is proposed that GUP may modify the black body spectrum as [34]

dE = -A T 4 + 15 T 6 ,

(18)

dt

9

where  is called the GUP parameter originated from the quantum aspects of gravity, and there is an ongoing debate on its value [34, 36]. It is also obvious that Eq. (16) is recovered whenever   0 and E = M . Calculations for three obtained cases lead to

,

(19)

where hypergeometric functions are solutions to the first

and third cases. It is also useful to mention that, in all

cases, the integrands recover Eq. (17) at the correspond-

ing appropriate limit. Since the third law is satisfied for

the

first

case

and

other

cases

when

0

<



<

1 2

,

and



<

0,

respectively, we plot the obtained evaporation times for

some values of  that fall into these intervals.

Figure (2) shows the behavior of decay time against

black hole mass for different values of  parameter. Each

point on the curves presents the time needed for a black

hole of mass 0 < M  1 to completely decay to zero mass.

As we observe within the upper panel, the decay time is

finite and grows as the initial black hole mass increases

and asymptotically reaches a finite value. Indeed, for 0 <



<

1 2

,

it

takes

finite

time

for

a

black

hole

to

evaporate.

The middle panel shows the behavior of decay time for

 < 1/2 (family of black curves) and 1/2 <  < 1 (family

of red and blue curves) where we observe that there exists

a critical value of this parameter (c) so that for  < c the decay time is finite and for  > c the decay time diverges. In the lower panel, we sketched the behavior

of decay time for  > 1 where it is seen that the decay

time for a black hole of finite mass grows unboundedly

and diverges as the initial mass of black hole increases.

However, for these values of  parameter and those of

middle panel, the third law of thermodynamics (S(T 

0)  0) is violated.

In Fig.(3) we have plotted decay time of a black hole

against its mass for the second case, where we observe

that the larger the black hole mass the longer it takes

for the black hole to completely evaporate. The slope of

iTi C curve increases for larger values of black hole mass so that the decay time grows unboundedly and diverges

for massive and super massive black holes. Finally, Fig.

(4) presents the decay time of black hole for the third

case. In the upper panel we observe that, for  < 0 for

which the third law is respected, a black hole with initial

finite mass will completely evaporate at a finite amount

of time. The lower panel shows that for  > 0 the decay

time is an increasing function of the black hole mass and

the heavier the initial black hole the longer it takes to

completely evaporate. However, from the viewpoint of

the third case, for this value of  parameter the third

law is not respected. As yet there is no agreement on

the numeric value of  parameter we have considered

the value of this parameter to be unity [34, 36]. We

further note that entropy is a dimensionless quantity in

each system of units where the Boltzmann constant is

unity.

Hence,

from

Eq.

(2)

we

can deduce

that





C/

2 Pl

and as we work in the system of units for which Pl = 1,

 parameter is a positive constant value which we have

considered it to be unity.

B. Tsallis black hole
Although Eq. (16) is used in some previous works which investigate the black hole thermodynamics in various non-extensive statistics [14­17], a comprehensive study in the Tsallis framework should employs the Tsallis counterpart of Eq. (16). The latter is a controversial issue [21, 37­39], as different averaging methods are useable and are employed in this statistics [21]. These different methods have their own benefits and shortcomings, and indeed, their correctness and accessibility situations are still unsolved and need more attentions and observations [21]. Here, motivated by the fact that

dE dt

=

-AqT 4

(20)

is obtained by different approaches [37], and is also originated from the black body spectrum in Tsallis statistics

We therefore observe that the decay time is finite and the lesser the value of q parameter, the longer it takes for a Tsallis black hole to completely evaporate. The blue curve presents the behavior of iqi where we see that the decay time grows unboundedly as the initial black hole mass increases.

Black body spectrum in Kaniadakis statistics has recently been studied [30, 41], and it has been shown that [30]

VI. SUMMARY
Based on the third law of thermodynamics, it is impossible for a system to touch zero-entropy state (at least a state with minimum and finite value of entropy) as its temperature tends to zero by only experiencing a finite number of thermodynamical processes. As each process spends its own time interval to be completed, we may even swap finite number of thermodynamical processes with finite time in the above statement. The story becomes more complicated in the ordinary black hole physics, generated by Bekenstein entropy, where it is obtained that entropy diverges, while its temperature approaches zero. In this situation, while black hole evaporates at finite time (17), and loses all of its mass, its temperature diverges at its final evolution steps meaning that we face a catastrophe [29]. Here, we only focused on Schwarzschild black hole as a primary solution which clearly exposes the mentioned inconsistency with third law.
Motivated by the long range nature of gravity, some recent works that propose a deep connection between quantum gravity and generalized statistics [16­20], and also the successes of these types of statistics in justifying some cosmological and gravitational phenomena [8­16], we studied the status of third law for a Schwarzschild black hole in the framework of some generalized statistics, and we found out that this law may theoretically be settled. Moreover, we obtained that the thermodynamic analysis and laws may help us find new energy definitions establishing a consistency between the results of thermodynamics and the predictions of quantum field theory about the black body radiation. The latter means that thermodynamics may eventually light the physics way to find a comprehensive energy definition [25, 26].
