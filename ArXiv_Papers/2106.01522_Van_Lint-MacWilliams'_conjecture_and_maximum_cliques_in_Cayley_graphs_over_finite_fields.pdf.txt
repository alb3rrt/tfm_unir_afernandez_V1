arXiv:2106.01522v1 [math.CO] 3 Jun 2021

ABSTRACT. A well-known conjecture due to van Lint and MacWilliams states that if A is a subset of Fq2 such that 0, 1  A, |A| = q, and a - b is a square for each a, b  A, then A must be the subfield Fq. This conjecture is often phrased in terms of the maximum cliques in Paley graphs. It was first proved by Blokhuis and later extended by Sziklai to generalized Paley graphs. In this paper, we give a new proof of the conjecture and its variants, and show this Erdos-Ko-Rado property of Paley graphs extends to a larger family of Cayley graphs, which we call Peisert-type graphs, resolving conjectures by Mullin and Yip.

1. INTRODUCTION

Throughout the paper, p denotes an odd prime, q denotes a positive power of p, and Fq denotes the finite field with q elements. For a finite field Fq, we denote Fq = Fq \ {0}.
In 1978, van Lint and MacWilliams [vLM78] studied the vectors of minimum weight in certain generalized quadratic residue codes, and they proposed the following conjecture: if A is a subset of Fq2 such that 0, 1  A, |A| = q, and a - b is a square for each a, b  A, then A is the subfield Fq. Although this conjecture is purely a statement about the structure of the subfield, it is often phrased in terms of the maximum cliques in Paley graphs of square order, and sometimes in terms
of the analog of Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem for Paley graphs [GM16, Chapter 5]. The conjecture was
first completely proved by Blokhuis [Blo84]; see Section 2 for a brief history of the conjecture and
related results by other authors. In this paper, we give a new proof of this conjecture (for p sufficiently large), explore its vari-
ant for other Cayley graphs defined on finite fields, including Peisert graphs, and confirm two
related conjectures by Mullin and the second author. In addition, we exhibit several new results on
maximal cliques in both generalized Paley and Peisert graphs. We recall few relevant terms from graph theory. Given an abelian group G and a set S  G\{0}
with S = -S, the Cayley graph Cay(G, S) is the graph whose vertices are elements of G, such that two vertices g and h are adjacent if and only if g - h  S. Such a set S is called a connection set, and the condition S = -S guarantees that the graph is undirected. In this paper, we introduce a new family of Cayley graphs.

In Lemma 2.10, we will see that Paley graphs, Peisert graphs, and more general versions of such graphs, are all special instances of Peisert-type graphs. The precise definitions of these graphs will be given in Section 2.
In order to state our first main result, we review a few additional definitions. A clique in a graph X is a subgraph of X that is a complete graph. A maximum clique is a clique with the maximum size, while a maximal clique is a clique that is not contained in a strictly larger clique. The clique number of X, denoted by (X), is the size of a maximum clique in a graph X. We prove the following theorem on the structure of maximum cliques in Peisert-type graphs.
Theorem 1.2. Let X be a Peisert-type graph of order q2, where q is a power of an odd prime p. Then (X) = q, and any maximum clique in X containing 0 is an Fp-subspace of Fq2.
Our second main result strengthens the conclusion of Theorem 1.2 under additional assumptions.
Theorem 1.3. Let n  2 be an integer and  > 0 a real number. Let X = Cay(F+q2, S) be a Peiserttype graph, where q = pn and p > 4.1n2/2. Suppose that there is a nontrivial multiplicative character  of Fq2, such that the set {(x) : x  S} is -lower bounded. Then in the Cayley graph X, the only maximum clique containing 0, 1 is the subfield Fq.
The definition of -lower bounded will appear in Definition 2.13 in Section 2; see Example 2.18 for a discussion on the sharpness of Theorem 1.3. As a straightforward application of Theorem 1.3, van Lint and MacWilliams' conjecture holds for all sufficiently large p.
We mention here one new application of Theorem 1.3. Mullin [Mul09, Chapter 8] conjectured that every maximum clique in the Peisert graph of square order containing 0, 1 must be the subfield Fq. Note that this is an exact analogue of van Lint and MacWilliams' conjecture for Peisert graphs. We prove Mullin's conjecture when p is sufficiently large.
Theorem 1.4. Let q  3 (mod 4) be a prime power. Let q = pn for some n  1. Assume that p > 8.2n2. Then the only maximum clique containing 0, 1 in the Peisert graph of order q2 is given by the subfield Fq.
Another objective of the paper is to prove new results on the structure of maximal cliques in Paley and Peisert graphs. While these results are not direct applications of our main Theorem 1.3, their proofs share similar ideas involving character sum estimates and the subspace structure. In particular, we confirm the conjecture of the second author on the maximal cliques in Peisert graphs of order q4.

Theorem 1.5 (Conjecture 4.4, [Yip21b]). If q is a power of a prime p  3 (mod 4) and q > 3, then Fq is a maximal clique in the Peisert graph of order q4.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide additional background, and further motivate the new definitions appearing in our paper. We also review the history of the van Lint and MacWilliams' conjecture, and put our main theorems in context. In Section 3, we explain the two main techniques used in our proof. Specifically, we borrow results regarding the number of directions determined by a point set, and estimates on character sums over finite fields. In Section 4, we give proofs of Theorem 1.2 and Theorem 1.3; afterwards, we extend Theorem 1.4 to generalized Peisert graphs. In Section 5, we prove Theorem 1.5 and several other results on maximal cliques in certain Cayley graphs.

2. BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW OF THE PAPER
This section is organized into four subsections. In Section 2.1, we give additional context for the conjecture due to van Lint and MacWilliams. In Section 2.2, we recall the definitions of Peisert and generalized Peisert graphs, mention Mullin's conjecture and describe what is currently known about the clique number of Peisert graphs. In Section 2.3, we give further motivation for defining Peisert-type graphs. In Section 2.4, we explain our main results in more detail, and deduce Theorem 1.4 as a quick application.

2.1. Van Lint-MacWilliams' conjecture and its variants. Paley graphs are defined on the additive group F+q of a finite field Fq, where q  1 (mod 4). The Paley graph on Fq, denoted by Pq, is the Cayley graph Cay(F+q , (Fq)2). In other words, Pq is the graph whose vertices are the elements of Fq, such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the difference between two vertices is a square in Fq.
Van Lint-MacWilliams' conjecture is often phrased as follows: in the Paley graph with order q2, the only maximum clique containing 0, 1 is the subfield Fq. Van Lint and MacWilliams [vLM78] proved their conjecture in the special case q = p. A shorter proof for the case q = p was obtained
by Lova´sz and Schrijver [LS83] using Re´dei's result on the number of directions; see Theorem 3.2
for a related discussion. The conjecture was first proved completely by Blokhuis [Blo84].

Theorem 2.1 ([Blo84]). If q is an odd prime power, then in the Paley graph of order q2, the only maximum clique containing 0, 1 is the subfield Fq.

Later, Bruen and Fisher [BF91] gave a different proof using the so-called "Jamison method".
Sziklai [Szi99] generalized Blokhuis's proof and extended the conjecture to certain generalized
Paley graphs; see Theorem 2.2. See Remark 2.16 for discussion on the proofs given by Blokhuis
and Sziklai, and how they differ from the proof in the present paper.
One can define generalized Paley graphs in an analogous way. They were first introduced by Cohen [Coh88] in 1988, and reintroduced by Lim and Praeger [LP09] in 2009. Let d > 1 be a positive integer. If q  1 (mod 2d), the d-Paley graph on Fq, denoted GP (q, d), is the Cayley graph Cay(F+q , (Fq)d), where (Fq)d is the set of d-th powers in Fq.
If d | (q + 1), the following theorem of Sziklai characterizes all maximum cliques in GP (q2, d).

Theorem 2.2 ([Szi99, Theorem 1.2]). If q is an odd prime power and d is a divisor of (q + 1) such that d > 1, then in the generalized Paley graph GP (q2, d), the only maximum clique containing 0, 1 is the subfield Fq; in particular, each maximum clique in GP (q2, d) is an affine transformation of the subfield Fq.
Remark 2.3. The assumption that d | (q + 1) in Theorem 2.2 is crucial. In the case d  (q + 1), it is easy to verify that Fq does not form a clique in GP (q2, d) (see for example [Yip21a, Lemma 1.5]); moreover, the second author [Yip21a] recently proved that (GP (q2, d))  q - 1. Therefore, it is unlikely that there is a nice characterization of maximum cliques in GP (q2, d), where d  (q + 1).

Sziklai [Szi99] also proved the following embeddability result on maximum cliques.

Theorem 2.4 (Theorem 1.3, [Szi99]). Let q be an odd prime power and d a divisor of (q + 1) such

Many authors have attempted to give a new proof of van Lint-MacWilliams' conjecture. Godsil and Meagher [GM16] suggested an approach using algebraic graph theory to prove Theorem 2.2 by analyzing the tightness of the ratio bound for the clique number of a strongly regular graph; see the discussion in [GM16, Section 5.9]. Partial progress in this direction was recently made by Goryainov and Lin [GL21]. The second author [Yip21a] gave a Fourier analytic characterization of maximum cliques, which suggests an alternative approach to prove Theorem 2.1.

2.2. Peisert graphs and generalized Peisert graphs. It is well-known that Paley graphs are self-complementary and symmetric. In [Pei01], Peisert discovered a new infinite family of selfcomplementary symmetric graphs, which he called P -graphs. This new family of graphs also goes under the name of Peisert graphs in the literature.
The Peisert graph of order q = pr, where p is a prime such that p  3 (mod 4) and r is even, denoted Pq, is the Cayley graph Cay(F+q , Mq) with
Mq := {gj : j  0, 1 (mod 4)},
where g is a primitive root of the field Fq. While the construction of Pq depends on the primitive root g, the isomorphism type of Pq is independent of the choice of g [Pei01]. Note that Mq is not closed under multiplication since g · g = g2 / Mq.
Kisielewicz and Peisert [KP04] showed that Paley graphs and Peisert graphs are similar in many aspects. However, we know very little about the structure of cliques of Peisert graphs other than Theorem 2.5.

Theorem odd, then

2(.5Pq(T) h=eoreqma5n.d1thine

[KP04]). Let q = ps, where p subfield Fq forms a clique in

 3 (mod 4) and s Pq; if k is even, then

= 2k. (Pq)

If 

k is q1/4

and the subfield Fq1/4 forms a clique in Pq.

Motivated by Theorem 2.1 and some numerical evidence, Mullin proposed the following con-

jecture [Mul09, Chapter 8]. Note that it is an analog of Theorem 2.1 on the characterization of

maximum cliques in a Paley graph with square order.

Conjecture 2.6 (Mullin). Let q  3 (mod 4) be a prime power. Then the only maximum clique containing 0, 1 in the Peisert graph of order q2 is given by the subfield Fq.

She remarked that if q is a prime, then Conjecture 2.6 can be proved using a similar technique as Theorem 2.2; see [Mul09, Corollary 3.4]. She also remarked that the proof of Theorem 2.2 fails to extend to Peisert graphs straightforwardly, since the connection set of a Peisert graph is not closed under multiplication, while for Paley graphs and generalized Paley graphs it is closed; see also Remark 2.16. We show that Conjecture 2.6 holds for sufficiently large q; this is Theorem 1.4 and its proof is given in Section 4.
In [Yip21a], the second author studied the connection between maximal cliques and maximum cliques in Peisert graphs of order q4, and conjectured the following based on numerical evidence.

Conjecture 2.7 (Conjecture 4.4, [Yip21b]). If q is a power of a prime p  3 (mod 4) and q > 3, then Fq is a maximal clique in the Peisert graph of order q4.
Note that a Peisert graph of order q4 is the disjoint union of two copies of the quadruple Paley graph GP (q4, 4). Therefore, Conjecture 1.5 strengthens [Yip21b, Theorem 1.6], which states that Fq is a maximal clique in GP (q4, 4). We show that the conjecture above holds; see Theorem 1.5.
Motivated by the similarity shared among Paley graphs, generalized Paley graphs, and Peisert
graphs, Mullin introduced generalized Peisert graphs; see [Mul09, Section 5.3]. In order to ensure
4

that GP (q, d) is an undirected graph, we also need a further hypothesis q  1 (mod 2d); in Mullin's thesis, this last congruence condition is q  1 (mod d), which appears to be a typo.

Definition 2.8. Let d be a positive even integer, and q a prime power such that q  1 (mod 2d).

The d-th power Peisert graph of order q, denoted GP (q, d), is the Cayley graph Cay(F+q , Mq,d), where

Mq,d =

gdk+j : 0  j  d - 1, k  Z , 2

and g is a primitive root of Fq.

Remark 2.9. Note that GP (q, 2) is precisely the Paley graph Pq, and GP (q, 4) is the Peisert

graph Pq if q is an even power of a prime p  3 (mod 4). Moreoever, a generalized Peisert graph

GP (q, d) is suggests that

characterize the maximum cliques

graph GP (q, d), which in GP (q, d) than doing

again so for

GP (q, d). Inspired by Conjecture 2.6, one can propose a similar conjecture on maximum cliques

in a generalized Peisert graph; we prove such a result in Theorem 2.17.

2.3. Peisert-type graphs. One motivation of this paper is to provide a new and short proof for

Theorem 2.2, and explore the structure of maximum cliques of those Cayley graphs which are

similar to Paley graphs and generalized Paley graphs. In particular, we consider Cayley graphs

defined on F+q2 with connection set being a union of cosets of Fq in Fq2 as in equation (1).

In our Definition 1.1 of a Peisert-type graph X = Cay(F+q2, S) we assume that Fq  S; in par-

ticular, these graphs enjoy the property that (X)  q. As we will see in the proof of Theorem 1.2,

We remark that our definition of Peisert-type graph shares some similarities with the definition of

Peisert graphs. Recall that a Peisert graph is simply a disjoint union of two copies of the quadruple Paley graph with same order. Note that Cay(F+q2, Fq) = GP (q2, q + 1) is a (q + 1)-Paley graph. Therefore, a Peisert-type graph is simply a disjoint union of copies of (q + 1)-Paley graph. Notice

also that we do not require the connection set S to be closed under multiplication in Definition 1.1. The following lemma allows us to unify the notions of generalized Paley graphs GP (q2, d) and
generalized Peisert graphs GP (q2, d) under the assumption that d | (q + 1). Note that when d is even, GP (q, d) already embeds inside GP (q, d); however, for odd d, there is no such obvious embedding as GP (q, d) is defined only for even values of d. The lemma shows that the Peisert-

type graph is general enough to encompass both cases.

Lemma 2.10. The following families of Cayley graphs are Peisert-type graphs:
· Paley graphs of square order; · Peisert graph with order q2, where q  3 (mod 4); · Generalized Paley graphs GP (q2, d), where d | (q + 1) and d > 1; · Generalized Peisert graphs GP (q2, d), where d | (q + 1) and d is even.

Both (generalized) Paley graphs and (generalized) Peisert graphs have many nice properties, and they have many applications in coding theory and design theory; see for example [Ale15, Lim17, KR19, WQWX07]. We also expect that Peisert-type graphs will have a new set of applications.

2.4. Main results and their implications. Our goal is to characterize maximum cliques in a Peisert-type graph X = Cay(F+q2, S). Our first main result, Theorem 1.2, asserts that the clique number of X is q, and every maximum clique in X has vector space structure; see [Yip21b] for
a related discussion on the vector space structure of maximal cliques in Cayley graphs. Later, we
will show that such subspace must be in fact the subfield Fq under additional assumptions. When the order of the graph is p2, Theorem 1.2 immediately implies the following corollary.

Corollary 2.11. Let X be a Peisert-type graph of order p2. Then the only maximum clique containing 0, 1 is the subfield Fp.

It is natural to ask whether the conclusion in Theorem 1.2 can be strengthened to the assertion that any maximum clique is an Fq-affine space. In Example 2.18 below, we will see a counterexample for this stronger conclusion.
In the same spirit as Theorem 2.4, we prove an embeddability result for cliques in Peisert-type graphs.

2.12. If C

where q - 1-

= pn, and m/(q + 1)

m= q,

|S|/(q then C

- is

contained in a Fp-subspace of Fq2 with dimension n.

We want to find minimal assumptions on Peisert-type graphs X = Cay(F+q2, S) for which the only maximum clique containing 0, 1 is the subfield Fq. Such a clique is already an Fp-subspace by Theorem 1.2, and to show that it is exactly the subfield Fq, we will use character sum estimates
in Section 3.2. The following definition is helpful for our discussion.

Definition 2.13. Let  > 0. A set M  C is said to be -lower bounded if for every integer k  N, and for every choice of x1, x2, . . . , xk  M, we have
k
xj  k.
j=1

Example 2.14. If a, b are non-negative integers, then

 |a + bi| = a2 + b2 

(a + b)2/2 = a+ b.

2

Therefore,

the

set

{1,

i}

is

1 2

-lower

bounded.

Our Theorem 1.3 has the hypothesis that {(x) : x  S} is -lower bounded for some  > 0.
The following example explains the necessity of the condition m  (q + 1)/2, or equivalently, |S|  (q2 - 1)/2 in Definition 1.1.

Example 2.15. Suppose that S  Fq2 with |S| > (q2 -1)/2. If  is an odd multiplicative character of Fq2, meaning that (-1) = -1, then we claim that S is not -lower bounded for any  > 0. Indeed, by the pigeonhole principle, {b, -b}  S for some b  Fq2, and (-b) + (b) = 0, showing that the condition in Definition 2.13 is not satisfied for k = 2.

In Lemma 2.10, we saw that certain generalized Paley graphs and Peisert graphs are Peisert-type
graphs. Next we present two quick applications of Theorem 1.3. It is straightforward to apply Theorem 1.3 to generalized Paley graph GP (q2, d), where d |
(q + 1). Let  to be a multiplicative character with order d; then the set {(xd) : x  Fq2} = {1}
6

is trivially 1-lower bounded. This immediately implies a slightly weaker version of Theorem 2.2, i.e., we obtain a simple proof that Theorem 2.2 holds if p is sufficiently large.

Remark 2.16. The original proofs of Theorem 2.1 by Blokhuis and Theorem 2.2 by Sziklai relied on the algebraic properties of the connection sets being squares and d-th powers, which are in fact subgroups. Although the implication of our main result to Paley graphs is slightly weaker than their results, it seems difficult to extend their method to a general Peisert-type graph.
Similarly, we can apply Theorem 1.3 to Peisert graph with order q2, where q  3 (mod 4), and deduce that Conjecture 2.6 holds as long as p is sufficiently large.

Proof of Theorem 1.4. Let g be a primitive root of Fq2 and let  be a multiplicative character such

that

(g)

=

i.

Then

the

set

{(g4k)

:

N}



{(g4k+1)

:

k



N}

=

{1,

i}

is

1 2

-lower

bounded,

as shown in Example 2.14. The required claim follows from Theorem 1.3.

In Section 4.3, we will apply Theorem 1.3 to study maximum cliques in a generalized Peisert graph GP (q2, d), where d | (q + 1). Note that Theorem 2.17 is a generalization of Theorem 1.4. It also strengthens Sziklai's result, because GP (q2, d) is a subgraph of GP (q2, d); see Remark 2.9
for more details.

Theorem 2.17. Let n  2 be an integer, and d  4 an even integer. Let X = GP (q2, d) be a generalized Peisert graph, where q = pn, p > 4.1n2d4/2(d - 1)2, and d | (q + 1). Then in X, the
only maximum clique containing 0, 1 is the subfield Fq.

The following example illustrates the necessity of the assumption that p is sufficiently large stated in Theorem 1.3.

Example 2.18. We consider the maximum cliques in a generalized Peisert graph GP (q2, q + 1),
which was shown to be a conference graph by Mullin [Mul09, Lemma 5.3.6] and also a Peisert-type graph in Lemma 2.10. Let g be a primitive root of Fq2; then gq+1 is a primitive root of Fq  Fq2. Therefore, GP (q2, q + 1) = Cay(F+q2, S) is a Peisert-type graph, where

S = g0Fq  g1Fq  · · ·  g(q-1)/2Fq.

Let C be a maximum clique containing 0; then C \ {0}  S. Let j be the smallest non-negative

integer such that C  gjFq = , and say agj  C, where a  Fq. Then (agj)-1C \ {0}  S; in particular, (agj)-1C is a maximum clique containing 0, 1.

Suppose Fq was the only maximum clique containing 0, 1; then the above argument would

show that all maximum cliques containing 0 are given by gjFq, where 0  j  (q - 1)/2. This

would

imply

that

the

number

of

maximum

cliques

containing

0

is

exactly

q+1 2

,

which

violates

the

computational results listed in [Mul09, Section 5.4]. For example, GP (34, 10) has 9 maximum

cliques

containing

0,

which

is

more

than

q+1 2

=

9+1 2

=

5.

Similarly,

GP (54,

26)

has

19

maximum

cliques

containing

0,

which

is

more

than

q+1 2

=

25+1 2

=

13.

This

shows

that

Theorem

1.3

can

only

hold for sufficiently large p.

3. MAIN TOOLS
In this section, we introduce two classical tools, which are both crucial for our proof.

3.1. Number of directions determined by a point set. Let AG(2, q) denote the affine Galois
plane over the finite field Fq. Let U  AG(2, q). We use Cartesian coordinates in AG(2, q) so that U = {(xi, yi) : 1  i  |U|}. The set of directions determined by U  AG(2, q) is

where  is the vertical direction. The theory of directions has been developed by Re´dei [Re´d73], Szonyi [Szo99], and many other authors. The main methods in the theory revolve around studying certain lacunary polynomials and symmetric polynomials. In modern language, the theory was built via the application of the polynomial method over finite fields. We remark that it has been

used several times to study cliques of Paley graphs and generalized Paley graphs. One highlight is

that it can be used to deduce the best-known upper bounds on the clique number of Paley graphs
and generalized Paley graphs; see recent papers [BSW20, Yip21c]. The standard way to identify Fq2 and AG(2, q) is via an embedding with respect to a basis of
Fq2 over Fq. We say that  : Fq2  AG(2, q) is an embedding if

(au + bv) = (a, b), a, b  Fq,

where {u, v} forms a basis of Fq2 over Fq. In the definition below, the term F -subspace means a vector subspace defined over a field F .

Definition 3.1 ([BBB+99]). Let U be a subset of AG(2, q) containing the origin, and let K be a subfield of Fq. We say U is K-linear if there is an embedding 0 of Fq2 into the AG(2, q), such that 0-1(U ) forms a K-subspace of Fq2.
The following theorem, due to Ball [Bal03], characterizes the number of directions determined by the graph of a function. It was built on previous works [Re´d73, BBS95, BBB+99].

Theorem 3.2 ([Bal03]). Let f : Fq  Fq be any function, where q is an odd prime power. Let

N

be

the

number

of

directions

determined

by

the

graph

of

f.

Then

either

,

or

there

is

a

subfield K of Fq such that the graph of f is K-linear. Moreover, in the latter case, N  q/|K| + 1

if K = Fq.

If U  AG(2, q) and |U| = q, we can apply Theorem 3.2 to study DU . This is because an affine transformation preserves the number of directions; if U does not determine all the directions, then U is a graph of a function after an affine transformation. The following stability result, due to Ssizzoenqyi-[SOz(o96q]).and Sziklai [Szi99], enables us to extend Theorem 3.2 to any U  AG(2, q) with

3.2. Character sums over subspaces. Recall that a multiplicative character of Fq is a group homomorphism from Fq to the multiplicative group of complex numbers with modulus 1. It is customary to define (0) = 0. We will use 0 to denote the trivial multiplicative character of Fq. For a multiplicative character , its order d is the smallest positive integer such that d = 0.
Many problems in number theory and combinatorics rely on non-trivial character sum estimates
over certain subsets of interest. We refer to [Cha10] for a nice survey paper by Chang, consisting
of known results on character sums over a subset of a given finite field, such as the extension of
8

the classical Po´lya-Vinogradov inequalities and Burgess' bounds to a general finite field. For our purpose, we need nontrivial character sum estimates over a subspace of a finite field.
Weil's estimate (see [LN97, Theorem 5.41]) is a classical tool of bounding complete character sums with a polynomial argument over a finite field. The following theorem, due to Katz [Kat89], essentially generalizes Weil's estimate to character sums over a subspace. Recall an element   Fqn is said to have degree k over Fq if Fqk is the smallest extension of Fq that contains .
Theorem 3.4 ([Kat89]). Let  be an element of degree n over Fq and  a non-trivial multiplicative character of Fqn. Then
( + a)  (n - 1)q.
aFq
Recently, Reis [Rei20] used Theorem 3.4 to prove the following character sum estimate over an affine space.
Theorem 3.5 ([Rei20]). Let A = u + V  Fqn be an Fq-affine space of dimension t  1, where n > 1. Suppose that there exists a nonzero element y  V such that the set Ay := {ay-1 | a  A} contains an element of degree n over Fq. If  is a non-trivial multiplicative character of Fqn, then

(a) < n · qt-1/2.

(2)

aA

The hypothesis on the existence of a degree n element cannot be completely dropped. For equation (2) to hold, we must have some assumptions on the structure of the affine space A. Typically, we need to assume that A does not have a special algebraic structure. As a counterexample, let A = V = Fqt be a proper subfield. Then we can find a non-trivial multiplicative character  on Fqn such that |A is the trivial character; in this case, aA (a) = qt -1 > nqt-1/2 holds for sufficiently large q, violating the conclusion in Theorem 3.5. This construction is an
example of the so-called subfield obstruction.
The following corollary gives a non-trivial upper bound on the character sums over a subspace when A is a subspace but not a subfield. Corollary 3.6 is a consequence of Theorem 3.5 and
[Rei20, Proposition 2.2]; here we include the proof for the sake of completeness.

Corollary 3.6. Let n be an integer such that n  2, and q an odd prime power. Let V  Fq2n be an Fq-space of dimension n, with 1  V, and V = Fqn. Then for any non-trivial multiplicative character  of Fq2n,

(x) < 2nq · |V|.

(3)

xV

Proof. It suffices to show that if V has size qn and V = Fqn, then V has an element with degree 2n. To prove this assertion, note that the number of elements in the union of Fqd as d | 2n with d < n is less than qn-1. Suppose that V has size qn, and V = Fqn. If V did not have any element of degree 2n, then all the elements of V \ Fqn would be contained in d|2n,d<n Fqd. Now, V  Fqn has dimension at most n - 1, which means that at least qn - qn-1 many elements of V must belong
9

to d|2n,d<n Fqd. This is a contradiction because for q  3, we have

Remark 3.7. Chang [Cha10, Section 5] also gave a somewhat weaker nontrivial estimate of character sums over subspaces of finite fields. Here we used Theorem 3.5 since it is stronger to some extent, and it does not involve any implicit constants, which can be challenging to determine.

Note that if n is an odd prime, then any element in Fqn \ Fq has degree n. Thus, we obtain the following corollary of Theorem 3.5, which will be used in Section 5.

Corollary 3.8. Let V  Fqn be an Fq-subspace of dimension 2, where n is an odd prime, q > n2, and 1  V . If  is a non-trivial multiplicative character of Fqn, then

(v) < |V| - 1.

(4)

vV

Proof. In view of Corollary 3.6, it suffices to show that, nq |V | < |V| - 1

for q  n2 + 1. Using |V | = q2, the above inequality is equivalent to:

4. MAXIMUM CLIQUES IN A PEISERT-TYPE GRAPH

We start the section by proving Lemma 2.10. In Section 4.2, we prove our main theorems and mention a few corollaries. Finally, in Section 4.3, we classify maximum cliques in generalized Peisert graphs as an application of our main theorem.

4.1. Proof of Lemma 2.10. As a motivation for Definition 1.1, Lemma 2.10 states that (generalized) Paley and Peisert graphs are special instances of Peisert-type graphs.

Proof of Lemma 2.10. The first two families of graphs are special cases of the last two. Thus, it

suffices to prove the claim for generalized Paley graphs and generalized Peisert graphs.

A generalized Paley graph GP (q2, d), where d | (q + 1) and d > 1, is of the form Cay(F+q2, S)

where S consists of all d-th powers in Fq2. Since d | (q + 1), we have Fq  S. Note that S is the

subgroup obtained by taking the image of the group homomorphism Fq2  Fq2 sending x  xd.

It

follows

that

|S|

=

q2-1 d

.

Finally,

Fq

is

a

subgroup

of

S

with

index

|S| (q2 - 1)/d q + 1 |Fq| = q - 1 = d
10

which allows us to write,

S = c1Fq  · · ·  cmFq

with

c1

=

1

and

m

=

q+1 d



q+1 2

.

Thus,

GP (q2, d)

is

a

Peisert-type

graph.

For the generalized Peisert graph GP (q2, d), where d | (q + 1) and d is even, the connection

set S can be expressed as a disjoint union:

d/2-1

S=

gi(Fq2 )d.

i=0

It

follows

that

GP (q2,

d)

is

a

disjoint

union

of

d 2

copies

of

GP (q2,

d).

Since

each

g i (Fq2 )d

can

be

expressed

as

a

union

of

q+1 d

cosets

of

Fq ,

we

can

express

S

above

as,

S = c1Fq  · · ·  cmFq

with

c1

=

1

and

m

=

q+1 d

·

d 2

=

q+1 2

.

Thus,

GP (q2, d)

is

a

Peisert-type

graph.

4.2. Proof of main results and consequences. With the two tools described in the previous section, we are ready to prove Theorem 1.2.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Let v  Fq2 \ S. Since Fq  S, {1, v} forms a basis of Fq2 over Fq. We consider the following standard embedding  of Fq2 into AG(2, q), where
(a + bv) = (a, b), a, b  Fq.
It is clear that the subfield Fq forms a clique in the Cayley graph X, so (X)  q. Let C be a maximum clique in X. We can express U, the image of C under the embedding  as

U = (C) = {(aj, bj) : 1  j  |C|}  AG(2, q).

If there are 1  j < k  |C| such that aj = ak, then bj = bk, and (bj - bk)v  S  vFq since C is a clique. Since S is a union of cosets of Fq, this implies that v  S, contradicting our assumption. This also rules out the possibility that |C|  q + 1 by the pigeonhole principle.

Therefore, |C| = (X) = q.

Let S =

m j=1

cj

Fq

.

Note that C

=

{aj + bjv

:

1



j



q}.

As we saw above, for any

1  j < k  q, we have aj = ak. Since C is a clique, we have (aj + bjv) - (ak + bkv) =

(aj - ak) + (bj - bk)v  S; it follows that

1

+

bj aj

- -

bk ak

v

(1

+

Fqv),

since S is a union of cosets of Fq and aj - ak  Fq. Notice that
m
S  (1 + Fqv) = cjFq  (1 + Fqv) .
j=1

We claim that |cjFq  (1 + Fqv)|  1 for each 1  j  m. Indeed, if x, y  cjFq  (1 + Fqv), then x - y = tv for some t  Fq; combining tv  cjFq with v / S, we get t = 0, and so x = y.
As we saw above, U does not determine the vertical direction. Since |U| = q, we must have that

U = {(x, f (x)) : x  Fq}
11

is the graph of some function f : Fq  Fq. Recall that the direction set DU consists of all ratios

bj -bk aj -ak

for

We

have

shown

that,

m

.

Equivalently, |DU |



q+1 2

.

By

Theorem

3.2,

it

follows

that

U

is

K -linear

for some subfield K  Fq. In particular, U is Fp-linear, and so C is an Fp-subspace of Fq2.

Inspired by the proof of Theorem 1.2, we provide a sufficient condition for a maximum clique in a Peisert-type graph on Fq2 to be the subfield Fq.

Corollary 4.1. Let X = Cay(F+q2, S) be a Peisert-type graph, where q = pn. Suppose that m = |S|/(q - 1)  pn-k, where k is the largest proper divisor of n. Then the only maximum
clique in X containing 0, 1 is the subfield Fq.

Proof. Let C be a maximum clique in X such that 0  C. Following the proof of Theorem 1.2, if
we embed C into AG(2, q), then its image U determines at most m directions and U is K-linear, where K is a subfield of Fq. If K = Fq, then Theorem 3.2 implies that m  q/|K| + 1  pn-k + 1, contradicting the assumption. Therefore, U is Fq-linear, i.e., C is an Fq-subspace. In particular, if 1  C, then C must be the subfield Fq.

With the help of Theorem 3.3, namely the stability result on the direction set, the proof of

Theorem 1.2 can be easily modified to prove Theorem 2.12.

Proof of Theorem 2.12. Let C be a clique in X, such that 0  C and |C| > q - 1-m/(q +1) q.

Similar to the proof of Theorem 1.2, we can embed C into AG(2, q) using the same map  to obtain

U



AG(2, q).

By

the exact same reasoning, U

determines at most m

<

q+1 2

directions, and U

does not determine the vertical direction. We can now apply Theorem 3.3 with |U| = q - k where k <

1

-

m q+1

q and  = 1 -

m q+1

-





[1/2, 1] for a sufficiently small 

>

0.

This allows us to extend U

to a larger set

U  AG(2, q), such that |U| = q, and U determines the same set of directions as U; in particular,

1 + DU v = 1 + DUv. Let (a, b) = (a, b)  U ; then a = a, and

1

+

+

DU  v



S.

It follows that (a - a) + (b - b)v  S; in other words, the preimage C = -1(U ) forms a maximum clique in X. The required claim follows from Theorem 1.2.

Now we are ready to present the proof of Theorem 1.3.

Proof of Theorem 1.3. Suppose that there is a nontrivial multiplicative character  of Fq2 such that the set {(x) : x  S} is -lower bounded. By Theorem 1.2, if 0  C is a clique in the Peisert-type graph X, with |C| = q, then C is an Fp-subspace of Fq2.
Suppose 0, 1  C, and C = Fq. Then C is an Fp-subspace of Fq2 = Fp2n and C \ {0}  S. By Corollary 3.6,
(x) < 2np · |C|.
xC 12

On the other hand, the set {(x) : x  S} is -lower bounded, which guarantees that

(x)  (|C| - 1).
xC
Comparing these two inequalities, we obtain

p

<

4n2 2

q q-1

2
.

Now, p > 4n2  16 because we can always assume   1 since characters have absolute value at most 1; so, q  p2  172 = 289. Thus,

p<

4n2 2

289 288

2



4.02783n2 2

which contradicts our hypothesis. Therefore, if 0, 1  C, then C = Fq.

Remark 4.2. Under additional conditions on the size of the connection set, the range for the values

of p in Theorem 1.3 can be improved. We already saw this phenomenon in Corollary 4.1. More

generally, suppose that

|S| q-1



q1- where 

=

1/s and s is a proper divisor of n.

Then using

Theorem 3.2 and applying Theorem 3.5 over the base field Fq = Fpn/s, we see that Theorem 1.3

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 2.17.

Proof of Theorem 2.17. Let g be a primitive root of Fq2, and  = exp(2i/d). Let  be the multiplicative character in Fq2 such that (g) = . Recall that the connection set S of the generalized Peisert graph X = GP (q2, d) is given by

S = gdk+j : 0  j  d - 1, k  Z . 2

5. MAXIMAL CLIQUES IN GENERALIZED PALEY GRAPHS AND PEISERT GRAPHS

Recall that our strategy to classify maximum cliques is the following: first show that every maximum clique has a subspace structure, and then apply character sum estimates over a subspace to show a maximum clique must be a subfield. In this section, we employ a similar idea to study maximal cliques. Assuming that a given clique is not maximal, if we can extend the clique and construct a maximal clique with a subspace structure, then it is possible that we can apply character sum estimates to derive a contradiction.
For generalized Paley graphs, this approach is made possible via the following lemma, established by the second author [Yip21b].

Lemma 5.1 ([Yip21b, Corollary 3.1]). Let GP (q, d) be a generalized Paley graph. If K is a proper
subfield such that K forms a clique in GP (q, d), then there is a K-subspace V of Fq, such that K  V , and V forms a maximal clique in GP (q, d).

Our aim is to provide partial progress towards the following main conjecture in [Yip21b]:

Conjecture 5.2 ([Yip21b, Conjecture 1.4]). Let d be a positive integer greater than 1. Let q  1

(mod

2d)

be

a

power

of

a

prime

p,

and

let

r

be

the

largest

integer

such

that

d

|

q-1 pr -1

.

Then

the

subfield Fpr forms a maximal clique in GP (q, d).

14

Conjecture 5.2 has been shown to be true for cubic Paley graphs with cubic order and quadruple Paley graphs with quartic order in [Yip21b]. We establish the following special case of Conjecture 5.2.

Theorem 5.3. Let d be a positive integer greater than 1. Let n be an odd prime. If q > n2 and

d

|

qn-1 q-1

,

then

the

subfield

Fq

forms

a

maximal

clique

in

GP (qn, d).

Proof.

Since q

is an odd prime power, d

|

qn-1 q-1

implies that qn



1

(mod

2d), and thus GP (qn, d)

is

a

well-defined

d-Paley

graph.

It

is

easy

to

verify

that

the

condition

d

|

q n -1 q-1

guarantees

that

Fq

forms a clique in GP (qn, d); see [BDR88, Theorem 1].

Suppose that Fq is not a maximal clique in GP (qn, d). Then Lemma 5.1 implies that there is a

clique V in GP (qn, d), such that V is a 2-dimensional Fq-subspace, and Fq  V . Therefore, if we

let  to be a multiplicative character of Fqn with order d, then

(v) = |V | - 1,

(6)

vV

which violates inequality (4) in Corollary 3.8, provided q > n2. This shows that Fq is a maximal clique in GP (qn, d).

To prove Theorem 1.5, we use a similar strategy. We need the following result from [Yip21b], which explores the connection between maximal cliques and maximum cliques in a Peisert graph of order q4.
Theorem 5.4 (Theorem 1.7, [Yip21b]). Let q be a power of a prime p  3 (mod 4). If Fq is not a maximal clique in the Peisert graph of order q4, then (Pq4) = q2; moreover, there exists h  Fq4 \ Fq, such that Fq  hFq forms a maximum clique.
We now have the tools to prove Theorem 1.5.
Proof of Theorem 1.5. Let g be a primitive root of Fq4. Let  be the multiplicative character of Fq4 such that (g) = i. It follows that for any k  N, (g4k) = 1, and (g4k+1) = i.
Suppose that Fq is not a maximal clique in the Peisert graph Pq4. By Theorem 5.4, there exists h  Fq4 \ Fq, such that V = Fq  hFq forms a maximum clique. In particular, for each x  V \ {0}, we have (x) = i or (x) = 1. Consequently,

(x) = a + bi,

xV

where a, b are non-negative integers such that a + b = |V| - 1. Therefore,

 (x) = a2 + b2 

(a + b)2/2 = |V| - 1 = q2- 1 .

(7)

xV

2

2

On the other hand, V is an Fq-subspace with dimension 2. Moreover, note that gq2+1 is a primitive root of the subfield Fq2; in particular, since q2 + 1  2 (mod 4), the subfield Fq2 does not form a clique in the Peisert graph of order q4. Therefore, V = Fq2. By Corollary 3.6,

(x) < 4q3/2.

(8)

xV 15

Combining inequalities (7) and (8), we must have q < 33. This implies that when q  33, Fq is a maximal clique in the Peisert graph of order q4.
Finally, in [Yip21b], using SageMath, we have verified that for each q  {7, 9, 11, 19, 23, 27, 31}, Fq is a maximal clique in the Peisert graph of order q4.
Remark 5.5. The assumption q > 3 is necessary in Theorem 1.5. Indeed, one can check that when q = 3, the subfield F3 is not maximal in the Peisert graph of order 81.

We conclude the section with a similar statement regarding maximal cliques in a generalized Peisert graph.

Theorem 5.6. Let d  4 be a positive even integer. Let n be an odd prime, and q be an even power

of

an

odd

prime

p.

If

q

>

1.03n2d4/2(d

-

1)2

and

d

|

q n -1 q-1

,

then

the

subfield

Fq

forms

a

maximal

clique in GP (qn, d).

The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 2.17 and Theorem 5.3, except that we need to establish the following variant of Theorem 5.4 for GP (qn, d) (which is straightforward by following the proof of Theorem 5.4 step by step), and use Lemma 4.4 to get a lower bound on the character
sum estimate.

Proposition 5.7. Let d  4 be a positive even integer. Let n be an odd prime, and q be an even

power

of

an

odd

prime

p.

If

d

|

qn-1 q-1

,

and

if

the

subfield

Fq

is

not

a

maximal

clique

in

GP (qn, d),

then there exists h  Fqn \ Fq, such that Fq  hFq forms a clique in X.
