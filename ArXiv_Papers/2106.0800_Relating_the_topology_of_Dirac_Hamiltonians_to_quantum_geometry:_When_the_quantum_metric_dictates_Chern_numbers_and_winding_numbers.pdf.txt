Quantum geometry has emerged as a central and ubiquitous concept in quantum sciences, with direct consequences on quantum metrology and many-body quantum physics. In this context, two fundamental geometric quantities play complementary roles: the Fubini-Study metric, which introduces a notion of distance between quantum states defined over a parameter space, and the Berry curvature associated with Berry-phase effects and topological band structures. In fact, recent studies have revealed direct relations between these two important quantities, suggesting that topological properties can, in special cases, be deduced from the quantum metric. In this work, we establish general and exact relations between the quantum metric and the topological invariants of generic Dirac Hamiltonians. In particular, we demonstrate that topological indices (Chern numbers or winding numbers) are bounded by the quantum volume determined by the quantum metric. Our theoretical framework, which builds on the Clifford algebra of Dirac matrices, is applicable to topological insulators and semimetals of arbitrary spatial dimensions, with or without chiral symmetry. This work clarifies the role of the Fubini-Study metric in topological states of matter, suggesting unexplored topological responses and metrological applications in a broad class of quantum-engineered systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recent advances have revealed the central role played by the Fubini-Study metric [1] in various fields of quantum sciences [2], with a direct impact on quantum technologies [3, 4] and many-body quantum physics [2, 5]. In condensed matter, the quantum metric generally defines a notion of distance over momentum space, and it was shown to provide essential geometric contributions to various phenomena, including exotic superconductivity [6­ 8] and superfluidity [9], orbital magnetism [10, 11], the stability of fractional quantum Hall states [12­17], semiclassical wavepacket dynamics [18, 19], topological phase transitions [20], and light-matter coupling in flat-band systems [21]. Besides, the quantum metric plays a central role in the construction of maximally-localized Wannier functions in crystals [22, 23], and it provides practical signatures for exotic momentum-space monopoles [24, 25] and entanglement in topological superconductors [26, 27].
Motivated by these developments, the quantum metric was experimentally measured in several quantumengineered systems, including cold atoms in optical lattices [28], NV centers in diamond [29­31], exciton polaritons [32] and superconducting qubits [33, 34]. The generalization of the quantum metric to mixed states (also known as the Bures metric) was also recently estimated through randomized measurements [35].

In this quantum-geometry context, surprising connections have been made between the quantum metric and the Berry curvature of Bloch states. The latter captures Berry-phase effects in Bloch bands [36] and constitutes the central ingredient for the construction of topological invariants, such as the Chern number [37, 38]. For instance, in superconductors, the integral of the quantum metric over momentum space captures the superfluid weight in flat bands, which was found to be bounded from below by the Chern number [6]. In Weyl-type systems, relations between the determinant of the quantum metric and the Berry curvature were shown to facilitate the observation of exotic topological defects based on quantummetric measurements [24, 25, 31, 34]. In systems of chiral multifold fermions, the trace of the quantum metric was shown to be quantized [39, 40], and related to the Chern number through an intriguing sum rule involving the states' angular momentum. In the context of Chern insulators, relations between the Berry curvature, the Chern number, the quantum metric and the quantum volume were recently established and understood based on the K¨ahler structure of the quantum-states space [41, 42]. These relations are known to play an important role in the formation and stabilization of fractional Chern insulators [12­17].

In this article, we establish general and exact relations between the quantum metric of generic Dirac Hamilto-

2

nians and the topological invariants of the corresponding Bloch bands, in arbitrary spatial dimensions d. This general framework, which builds on the Clifford algebra of Dirac matrices, expresses the topological indices of Chern insulators, but also chiral insulators and topological semimetals, in terms of the determinant of the quantum metric. These results highlight the central role played by the Fubini-Study metric in topological states of matter, but it also suggests unexplored topological responses in quantum-engineered settings.
Specifically, we first obtain general relations between the determinant of the quantum metric and two types of topological invariants: the n-th Chern character for systems without chiral symmetry in 2n spatial dimensions, and the winding-number class for systems with chiral symmetry in 2n - 1 spatial dimensions. These relations [Eqs. (12) and (23)], which are the central results of this work, stem from a special mapping between the system's Brillouin zone and a sphere, as we illustrate in Fig. 1. Upon integration over the Brillouin zone, these relations provide useful inequalities between topological indices of Bloch bands and the quantum volume: For gapped systems without chiral symmetry in d = 2n dimensions, this inequality involves the n-th Chern number and reads

FIG. 1. Schematics of the main results: (a) In the case of gapped systems without chiral symmetry, in d = 2n dimensions, the first Brillouin zone (FBZ) is mapped to the 2nsphere by n(k); see Eq. (4). The topological properties of Bloch states are then deduced from the topology of quantum states over the 2n-sphere, which involves fundamental relations with the determinant of the metric [Eqs. (8) and (12)]. (b) A similar picture holds for chiral systems, where the map n(k) is now restricted to the equator S2n-1 of S2n, whose topology is captured by a winding-number class [Eqs. (11) and (23)]. The Dirac Hamiltonian involves D = 2n + 1 Dirac matrices in the non-chiral case (a) and D = 2n Dirac matrices in the chiral case (b); see Eq. (3) and text below.

where the quantum volume volg(T2n) is defined as the integral of the quantum metric's determinant over the Brillouin zone, volg(T2n) = T2n det(g) d2nk. A similar inequality is obtained for the winding number of (2n-1)-
dimensional chiral insulators,

We describe below how these inequalities can be saturated, and we illustrate how they can be used in practice so as to deduce the topological nature of exotic quantum matter from quantum-metric measurements.
This article is organized as follows: Section II introduces the general framework of Dirac Hamiltonians, setting the focus on their geometric and topological properties using the language of differential forms. More explicit relations between the quantum metric, the components of the Berry curvature and the Chern numbers are then specified in Section III for the case of topological insulators without chiral symmetry. Chiral insulators, which are characterized by winding numbers, are then treated in Section IV. Topological semimetals are eventually discussed in Section V. Each Section illustrates our general formula based on concrete and emblematic models of topological matter. Our concluding remarks are presented in Section VI.

II. DIRAC HAMILTONIANS, SPHERES AND QUANTUM GEOMETRY

We consider an important class of Bloch Hamiltonians, which are built from Dirac matrices according to

D

HD(k) = - di(k)i = -d(k) · ,

(3)

i=1

where the i matrices form an irreducible representation (irrep) of the complex Clifford algebra in D generators [43],

ij + ji = 2ijI, 1  i, j  D,
and where the momentum k is defined over a d-dimensional Brillouin zone Td. The Dirac matrices i have size 2n × 2n, for n = D/2 , hence leading to a multi-band spectrum E(k). This broad class of Hamiltonians include emblematic models of topological insulators and semimetals, such as Chern insulators in two and four spatial dimensions [38, 44, 45], the Su-ShriefferHeeger (SSH) model in one dimension [36, 46­49], chiral insulators in three dimensions [50], and Weyl semimetals in three and five dimensions [51, 52].
Due to the Clifford algebra relations, the spectrum of the generic Hamiltonian in Eq. (3) is directly obtained as
E(k) = ±|d(k)|; we note that the corresponding bands are degenerate in general. In the following, we consider

3

non-interacting fermions at half-filling, which amount to setting the Fermi level at EF = 0. In this framework, the spectrum crosses the Fermi level whenever the vector
d vanishes. Because the vector has D components, this will generically occur in a (d - D) -dimensional (closed) submanifold of the Brillouin zone, which we will refer to as the generalized Fermi surface  [53]. For D > d,  will, generically, be the empty set and the system will be gapped. In this work, we will consider cases where d = 2n and D = 2n + 1, for some integer n > 0, corresponding to gapped systems without chiral symmetry, and cases where d = 2n - 1 and D = 2n, corresponding to gapped systems with chiral symmetry. In the latter case, the chiral symmetry is implemented by the additional matrix D+1 = 2n+1 which, up to a multiplicative constant, is the product of all the 2n gamma matrices in the irrep; this matrix 2n+1 anticommutes with the Hamiltonian, hence signaling chiral symmetry. For D = d,  consists, generically, of a finite collection of isolated points, and the system falls into the class of Weyl-type semimetals.
Away from , one can define a unit length vector n = d/|d| living on a (D - 1)-dimensional sphere SD-1, and which completely determines the eigenstates of the Bloch Hamiltonian: at momentum k the eigenstates are determined by n(k)  SD-1. From the point of view of the eigenstates, it is sufficient to consider the Hamiltonian

H = -n · , with n  SD-1.

(4)

In the following, we consider the cases D = 2n + 1 and D = 2n separately, due to the presence or absence of chiral symmetry.
Let us first consider D = 2n + 1. The negative energy eigenstates (i.e. the Fermi sea) are determined by the projector P = (1/2)(I + n · ). The quantum geometry associated with this projector, or equivalently, with the associated eigenvector spaces, is rich and it is encoded in the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) [54], whose imaginary part is related to the non-Abelian Berry curvature [36],

1  = P dP  dP P = P (dn · )  (dn · ) P, (5)
4

where  denotes the wedge product of forms (which guarantees that  is a completely skew-symmetric tensor). The real part of the QGT is the non-Abelian quantum metric, the trace of which reduces to the standard quantum metric [2],

g2n = Tr (P dP dP P ) = 2n-3dn · dn.

(6)

Remarkably, g2n is the round metric of a sphere S2n of radius R with R2 = 2n-3. The only non-trivial topological
invariant [55] that one can associate with the projector P
(and in fact, with the Hamiltonian H) is the n-th Chern
character, which is expressed as

1 2n = n!

i

n
Tr (n) .

(7)

Using the properties of the i matrices [Appendix A], we obtain

2n

=

(-1)n

dvolg2n volg2n (S2n

)

,

(8)

where dvolg is the volume form associated with the metric g, and volg2n (S2n) = S2n dvolg2n is the so-called quantum volume. The result in Eq. (8), which connects the
quantum metric g2n to the topological Chern character 2n, is central in our work, and it will be made more explicit in the next Sections.
For D = 2n, chiral symmetry imposes that the Hamil-
tonian can be recast in the form

H = -n ·  =

0 q q0

,

(9)

where q is a unitary matrix. Because the irrep of the Clifford algebra in D = 2n generators can be seen as the restriction of the irrep of the Clifford algebra in 2n + 1 generators, one can describe the geometry and topology of this Hamiltonian in terms of S2n-1  S2n, where S2n-1 can be seen as the equator of the sphere S2n; see Fig. 1. As a consequence, the quantum metric is exactly the restriction to the equator of Eq. (6),

g2n-1 = g2n

= 2n-3dn · dn,

S 2n-1

(10)

and it defines the round metric of a sphere S2n-1 of radius R with, as before, R2 = 2n-3. Here, the relevant non-trivial topological invariant that we can associate to H is a winding-number class, which can be determined by dimensional reduction arguments. Specifically, it is the winding-number class of a gauge transformation on the equator S2n-1 of S2n, which relates eigenvectors in different gauges defined in the upper and lower hemispheres, and which is homotopic to the unitary transformation q. The differential form that represents the winding-number class is expressed as

2n-1 = (-1)n-1

i n (n - 1)! Tr
2 (2n - 1)!

q-1dq 2n-1 .

As in Eq. (8), the form 2n-1 can be written in terms of the volume element of the quantum metric over S2n-1,

2n-1

=

(-1)n

dvolg2n-1 volg2n-1 (S2n-1

)

.

(11)

The similarity with the non-chiral case can be deduced from the dimensional-reduction argument (see, for instance Ref. [56], where the variation of the Chern-Simons forms under gauge transformations, whose derivatives determine the Chern characters locally, is expressed in terms of the winding-number class of the gauge transformation), which sets S2n 2n = S2n-1 2n-1 = (-1)n.
The following Sections aim at clarifying and illustrating the results in Eqs. (8) and (11) based on relevant examples of topological matter.

III. GAPPED SYSTEMS WITHOUT CHIRAL SYMMETRY

Here we set d = D - 1 = 2n for some integer n > 0. In this case, H(k) is generically gapped and there is no chiral symmetry. The vector n(k) is hence welldefined everywhere and it can be used to pullback the quantum geometry in S2n to the Brillouin zone T2n; see Fig. 1(a). We will write the pullback of the metric in the usual periodic coordinates k = (k1, ..., k2n) defined in the Brillouin zone as

The non-trivial topological invariant associated with

H(k) is given by pulling back the topological invariant

over S2n. Now because D - 1 = d, the pullback of the

volume form dvolg2n is, up to the sign of the Jacobian of the transformation at each point, the volume form of the

pullback metric dvolg = det(g)dk1 ...dk2n. Further-

more, because the Berry curvature in momentum space

is the pullback of the Berry curvature in S2n, it follows

that the pullback of 2n is the n-th Chern character of

the occupied Bloch bundle. In local coordinates, and us-

volg

(T2n),

(13)

where we have identified the quantum volume volg(T2n) = T2n det(g)d2nk; the latter quantity is also known as the complexity of the band [22]. We point out that the equality is satisfied provided sgn(dn) is constant (every-
where where it is meaningful, i.e., where det(g) = 0), or, equivalently, if the function on the left-hand side of Eq. (12) does not change sign. Note also that
det(g)d2nk is not a volume form in the strict mathematical sense because it necessarily vanishes somewhere in the Brillouin zone. The reason is that n : T2n  S2n cannot be an immersion since the fundamental group of

the torus is non-trivial while that of the sphere is trivial; see the proof of Theorem 3 of Ref. [41] for the case n = 1 which is readily generalized to this case. From Eq. (13), one immediately concludes that if the quantum volume is smaller than 1, then the system is certainly adiabatically connected to the trivial insulator.
In the following, we illustrate the significance of this result by considering paradigmatic examples of Chern insulators in d = 2 and d = 4 dimensions.

A. Chern insulators in d = 2 dimensions

A generic 2-band Chern insulator model in two dimensions reads
H(k) = (k)I + dx(k)1 + dy(k)2 + dz(k)3, (14)
where the matrices 1,2,3 are Pauli matrices; see Refs. [44, 45] and below for an explicit example. The quantum metric identifies a 2-sphere of radius 1/2 [Eq. (6)], and its relation to the Chern character (i.e. the Berry curvature in the lower band) simply reads [Eq. (12)]

The topological phase diagram of this model is captured by the first Chern number: Ch1 = 0 for |M | > 2, (17) Ch1 = 1 for -2 < M < 0 and Ch1 = -1 for 0 < M < 2. The inequality involving the Chern number and the quantum volume, Eq. (17), is illustrated in Fig. 2.

IV. GAPPED SYSTEMS WITH CHIRAL SYMMETRIES

We now set d = D - 1 = 2n - 1 for some integer n >
0. In this case, H(k) is again generically gapped but
chiral symmetry is now present. As above, the vector
n(k) is well-defined everywhere and it can be used to pullback the quantum geometry in S2n-1 to the Brillouin torus T2n-1. The pullback of the metric in the periodic coordinates k = (k1, ..., k2n-1) is written as above,

The non-trivial topological invariant associated with
H(k) is given by pulling back the topological invariant represented by 2n-1 over S2n-1. Again, since D - 1 = d, the pullback of the volume form dvolg2n is, up to the sign of the Jacobian of the transformation
at each point, the volume form of the pullback metric
dvolg = det(g)dk1  ...  dk2n. This leads to our second main result,

A. Chiral insulators in d = 1 dimension

The simplest instance of a chiral insulator is provided by the generic Hamiltonian

H(k) = dx(k)1 + dy(k)2,

(25)

which describes the emblematic Su-Shrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model in one dimension [36, 46]; see below. The

7

1d chiral insulator is characterized by a quantized Zak phase [47­49], which defines a topological winding number in the 1D Brillouin zone. Using the formula in Eq. (23) and using the fact that in this case the antipodal map is orientation preserving, we find that the corresponding winding-number class is related to the quantum metric in the lower band according to

The Su-Schrieffer­Heeger (SSH) model

We now address the SSH model in detail to illustrate this d = 1 case. The Bloch Hamiltonian in Eq. (25) is specified by the vector

d(k) = (v + w cos(k), w sin(k)),

(29)

where v, w are the two alternating hopping amplitudes in the SSH lattice [49]. The relative strength of the hoppings |v/w| determines the topological character of the model. The spectrum of the model is given by E(k) = ±|d(k)| = ± v2 + w2 + 2vw cos(k), the latter being gapless when |v/w| = 1. The quantum metric is readily evaluated and reads

in agreement with Eq. (32) and the relation in Eq. (26). Without loss of generality, we may take w = 1, in which
case the phase diagram is dictated by the winding number as follows:  = 0 for |v| > 1 and  = -1 for |v| < 1. For v = 0, which is located in the non-trivial regime, the quantum metric assumes the simple form

and the winding-number class is simply represented by

We illustrate the inequality involving the winding number and the quantum volume [Eq. (28)] in Fig. 4. We note that the right-hand side of this inequality is smaller than 1 for |v| > 1, hence implying  = 0, and it is exactly equal to 1 for |v| < 1; this is consistent with the fact that sgn(dn) is constant as a function of k in that region.

B. Chiral insulators in d = 3 dimensions
Moving on to higher-dimensions, a model describing a chiral insulator in d = 3 dimensions can be written in the form
H(k) = d0(k)0 + d1(k)1 + d2(k)2 + d3(k)3, (36)
where the 's represent the 4 × 4 Dirac matrices; see Ref. [50] for an explicit model and implementation. Here, the quantum metric identifies a 3-sphere, and the relevant

8

topological invariant characterizing the insulator is provided by the 3D winding number [62]. Using the formula in Eq. (23), the relation between this higher-dimensional winding-number class and the quantum metric reads

where we used the fact that the antipodal map is orientation preserving between spheres of odd dimensions. The inequality in Eq. (24) reduces to

(38)

where  is the winding number in d = 3 dimensions.

An explicit chiral insulator in d = 3 dimensions

We consider the following Bloch Hamiltonian, describing the chiral insulator of Ref. [50],

3
H(k) = tSO sin(ki)i
i=1
+ (mz - t0 (cos(k1) + cos(k2) + cos(k3))) 0,

where the physical meaning of the parameters tSO, mz and t0 is not relevant for this discussion. For the sake of presentation, we hereby set tSO = t0 = 1, and M  mz, so that the above equation reduces to

3
H(k) = sin(ki)i
i=1
+ (M - (cos(k1) + cos(k2) + cos(k3))) 0

= d(k) · ,

(39)

which is a higher dimensional analogue of the massive Dirac model considered in Section III A. The phase diagram of this model is established by the 3D winding number:  = 0 for |M | > 3,  = +1 for -3 < M < -1,  = -2 for -1 < M < 1, and  = +1 for 1 < M < 3. We illustrate the inequality involving the 3D winding number and the quantum volume [Eq. (38)] in Fig. 5.

V. GAPLESS WEYL-TYPE SYSTEMS

A prime example of a gapless Weyl-type system is provided by the 3D Weyl Hamiltonian [51]

H(k) = kx1 + ky2 + kz3.

FIG. 5. 3d winding number and quantum volume as a function of M .

The Berry curvature field in the lower band emanates radially from the origin k = 0, and its flux through a 2sphere S2 that contains the origin is quantized according to the first Chern number

i

Ch1 =

 = 1. S2 2

(41)

As pointed out in Ref. [24], the quantum metric in the lower band identifies a 2-sphere and is related to the Berry curvature (using coordinates on the sphere) as

iij = 2 det(g)ij, 1  i, j  2.

(42)

This is the simplest form of Eqs. (8) and (12), where the Brillouin zone is now replaced by a sphere surrounding the monopole. Accordingly, the topological "monopole" charge can be expressed in terms of the quantum metric as

Ch1

=

volg2 (S2) 

=

1.

(43)

Weyl-type systems can also be generalized to higher dimensions [52, 63]. For instance, a generic 5D Weyl Hamiltonian can be written in terms of the 4 × 4 Dirac matrices as [52]

H(k) = k00 + k11 + k22 + k33 + k44. (44)

In this case, the origin hosts a Yang (non-Abelian) monopole whose topological charge is provided by the second Chern number. Using the formula in Eq. (12), we find that this monopole charge can be obtained from the quantum metric as

1 Ch2 = 2

where the Brillouin zone T4 was replaced by a sphere S4. The quantum metric identifies a 4-sphere of radius 1 that surrounds the Yang monopole, whose topological
2
charge density is a multiple of the quantum volume form.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS
The general relations derived in this work indicate that the topological indices characterizing topological insulators and semimetals can be obtained from quantummetric measurements within the framework of Dirac Hamiltonians. The quantum metric can be extracted from dynamical susceptibilities, which can be measured by monitoring excitation rates upon periodic modulations [23, 64], as was experimentally demonstrated recently in various quantum-engineered settings [28, 29, 31, 33, 34]; see Ref. [65] for a generalization to degenerate (non-Abelian) systems. Altogether, this indicates that a wide range of quantized responses and topological indices (including winding numbers) could be accessed in quantum-engineered systems through quantummetric measurements, including higher-dimensional settings [60, 66­68].
Moreover, it would be interesting to extend our framework to other classes of Hamiltonians, such as those based on Gell-Mann matrices [24, 62, 69­71], where similar relations between topology and quantum geometry have been identified [24].
Finally, we note that the quantum metric is directly related to the notion of quantum Fisher information, which quantifies the metrological potential of quantum states via the Cram´er-Rao bound; see Ref. [30] and references therein. It would thus be intriguing to explore the implications of the topological inequalities [Eqs. (1) and (2)] in this metrological context.
