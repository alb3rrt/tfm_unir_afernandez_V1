Fully nontrivial solutions to elliptic systems with mixed couplings
M´onica Clapp and Angela Pistoia June 4, 2021

Abstract We study the existence of fully nontrivial solutions to the system


-ui + iui = ij |uj |p|ui|p-2ui in ,
j=1

i = 1, . . . , ,

in a bounded or unbounded domain  in RN , N  3. The i's are real

numbers,

and

the

nonlinear

term

may

have

subcritical

(1

<

p

<

N N -2

),

critical

(p =

N N -2

),

or

supercritical

growth

(p >

N N -2

).

The matrix

(ij )

is symmetric and admits a block decomposition such that the diagonal

entries ii are positive, the interaction forces within each block are at-

tractive (i.e., all entries ij in each block are non-negative) and the inter-

action forces between different blocks are repulsive (i.e., all other entries

are non-positive). We obtain new existence and multiplicity results of

fully nontrivial solutions, i.e., solutions where every component ui is non-

trivial. We also find fully synchronized solutions (i.e., ui = ciu1 for all i = 2, . . . , ) in the purely cooperative case whenever p  (1, 2).

Keywords: Weakly coupled systems; mixed cooperation and compe-

tition; positive and sign-changing solutions; Nehari manifold.

1 Introduction

We consider the system of nonlinear elliptic equations



(1.1)

-ui + iui =  ij |uj |p|ui|p-2ui,

ui  H,

j=1
i = 1, . . . , ,

where H is either H01() or D01,2(),  is an open subset of RN , N  3, i  R and p > 1. We assume that

M. Clapp was partially supported by CONACYT grant A1-S-10457 (Mexico) A. Pistoia was partially supported by Fondi di Ateneo "Sapienza" Universit`a di Roma
(Italy).

(A1) the operators -+i are well defined and coercive in H for all i = 1, . . . , ,
(B1) the matrix (ij) is symmetric and admits a block decomposition as follows: For some 1 < q <  there exist 0 = 0 < 1 < · · · < q-1 < q =  such that, if we set
Ih := {i  {1, . . . , } : h-1 < i  h}, Ih := Ih × Ih, Kh := (i, j)  Ih × Ik : k  {1, . . . , q} {h} ,
then ii > 0,
ij  0 if (i, j)  Ih and ij  0 if (i, j)  Kh, h = 1, . . . , q.
This type of systems models some physical phenomena in nonlinear optics and describes the behavior of multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates. The coefficient ij represents the interaction force between the components ui and uj. The sign of ij determines whether the interaction is attractive or repulsive. If ij  0 for all i = j (i.e., if q = 1) the system (1.1) is called purely cooperative, and it is called purely competitive if ij  0 for all i = j (i.e., if q = ).
In the past fifteen years, systems that are either purely cooperative or purely competitive have been extensively studied, particularly those with cubic nonlinearity (i.e., with p = 2). It is convenient to consider other powers, specially when dealing with critical systems; see, e.g., [6­9]. We refer to the introduction of the papers [4,10] for an overview on the topic and an ample list of references.
Systems with mixed couplings were considered in the seminal paper [13] by Lin and Wei and more recently in [5,14,15,17­20]. All of these works treat only the cubic nonlinearity p = 2. In the present paper, we are mainly concerned with the case p < 2.
According to the decomposition given by (B1), we shall write a solution u = (u1, . . . , u) to (1.1) in block-form as
u = (u¯1, . . . , u¯q) with u¯h = (uh-1+1, . . . , uh ).
u is called semitrivial if some but not all of its components ui are zero and it is said to be fully nontrivial if every component ui is different from zero. We shall call it block-wise nontrivial if at least one component of each block u¯h is nontrivial.
We prove the following result.
Theorem 1.1. Assume (A1) and (B1). Assume further that
(A2) the embedding H  L2p() is compact.
Then, the system (1.1) has a least energy block-wise nontrivial solution.
The precise meaning of least energy block-wise nontrivial solution is given in Definition 2.1. The proof of this result is obtained by adapting the variational approach introduced in [9], and is given in Section 2.

If the system is purely competitive (i.e., q = ) any block-wise nontrivial solution is fully nontrivial. On the other hand, for any choice of ih  Ih, every solution to the purely competitive system

 -vh + ih vh =



ihik |vk|p|vh|p-2vh,

vh  H,

k=1
h = 1, . . . , q,

gives rise to a block-wise nontrivial solution of (1.1) whose ih-th component is vh, h = 1, . . . , q, and all other components are 0. If q =  this solution is not fully nontrivial. The following result, whose proof is given in Section 3, provides
existence of a fully nontrivial solution.

Theorem 1.2. Assume (A1) and (B1), and let p  2. There exists a positive constant C independent of (ij ) - but depending on , i, p and q - with the property that, if

(B2) either p < 2 and

then every least energy block-wise nontrivial solution to the system (1.1) is fully nontrivial.

If  is a bounded domain, assumption (A1) holds true if i > -1(), where 1() is the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of - in , and (A2) is satisfied if the nonlinear term is subcritical. So combining Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 we obtain the
following result.

Theorem

1.3.

If

i

for

all

i = 1, . . . , ,

1<p<

and (ij ) satisfies (B1) and (B2), the system



-ui + iui =  ij |uj|p|ui|p-2ui,

ui  H01(),

j=1
i = 1, . . . , ,

has a fully nontrivial solution.

It is well known that compactness is more likely to hold true in a symmetric setting. Symmetries are also helpful to obtain sign-changing solutions. Symmetric versions of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 yield the following results.

Theorem

1.4.

If

1<

p<

N N -2

and

(ij )

satisfies

(B1)

and

(B2),

the

system



-ui + ui =  ij |uj|p|ui|p-2ui,

ui



j=1
H1(RN ),

i = 1, . . . , ,

has a fully nontrivial solution whose components are positive and radial. If N = 4 or N  6 it has also and a fully nontrivial solution whose compo-
nents are nonradial and change sign.

Theorem

1.5.

If

p

=

N N -2

and

(ij )

satisfies

(B1)

and

(B2),

the

critical

system



-ui =  ij |uj|p|ui|p-2ui,

ui



j=1
D1,2(RN ),

i = 1, . . . , ,

has a fully nontrivial solution whose components are positive. If N = 3 or N  5, it has also a a fully nontrivial solution whose components
change sign.

The proof of the last two theorems and further examples are given in Section

4. They include, for instance, existence and multiplicity results for (1.1) with

supercritical

nonlinearities

(p

>

N N -2

),

or

in

an

exterior

domain.

Assumption (A2) may be considerably weakened. As we shall see below, the

solution given by Theorem 1.1 minimizes a C1-functional  : U  R defined on

an open subset U of a smooth Hilbert manifold. So compactness is only needed

at the level c0 := infU ; see Theorem 2.5 for the weaker statement. For p = 2 our condition (B2) is basically the same as in [18, Theorem 1.5]

and it is weaker than the one in [18, Theorem 1.4]. Our approach, however, is

different and it has the advantage that it can be used to treat the case p < 2.

If the system (1.1) is purely cooperative (i.e., q = 1) and p < 2, assumption

(B2) is satisfied and, so, Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 yield the existence of a fully

nontrivial solution. This stands in contrast with the situation for p = 2 where

purely cooperative systems do not always have a positive solution; see, e.g., [2,

Theorem 0.2] or [16, Theorem 1]. For purely cooperative systems with p = 2

our condition (B2) is basically that in [13, Corollary 2.3].

Finally, we obtain a new result concerning existence of synchronized solutions

when all the i's coincide, i.e., i :=  for all i = 1, . . . , . We say that u =

(u1, . . . , u) is a fully synchronized solution if ui = ciu, where u is a nontrivial

solution to the single equation

-u + u = |u|2p-2u, u  H,

4

and c = (c1, . . . , c)  R solves the algebraic system

(1.2)


ci = ij|cj|p|ci|p-2ci, ci > 0, for every i = 1, . . . , .
j=1

There are some results concerning the solvability of (1.2). The easiest case is when p = 2 and  = 2. Then a solution to (1.2) exists if and only if

12  (- 1122, min{11, 22})  (max{11, 22}, +).

If p = 2 and   2, a solution to (1.2) exists when ij :=  for all i = j and

  , min{ii}  (max{ii}, +) for some  < 0 (see [1, Proposition 2.1]),

while

and

a

to

(1.2)

(see [7, Theorem 1.1]). The following theorem complements these results.

Theorem 1.6. Let p < 2 and assume that the system (1.1) is purely cooperative (i.e., ii > 0 and ij  0 for all i, j = 1, . . . , , i = j) and that i =  for all i = 1, . . . , . Then, for each i, there exists ci > 0 such that (c1u, . . . , cu) is a solution to (1.1) for every solution u to the equation

-u + u = |u|2p-2u, u  H.

The proof of this result relies on a simple minimization argument and it is given in Section 5.

2 A simple variational approach

We assume throughout that (A1) and (B1) hold true. Recall that H is either H01() or D01,2(). Assumption (A1) asserts that

v i :=

(|v|2 + iv2) 1/2


is a norm in H, equivalent to the standard one. Let Hi denote the space H equiped with this norm and, for the partition in assumption (B1), define

Hh := Hh-1+1 × · · · × Hh ,

h = 1, . . . , q,

H := H1 × · · · × H = H1 × · · · × Hq.

A point in Hh will be denoted by u¯h, a point in H by

u = (u¯1, . . . , u¯q) = (u1, . . . , u) with u¯h  Hh, ui  Hi,

and their norms by

u¯h :=

ui

2 i

1/2

and

u :=

q

u¯h

1/2
.

h=1

:=

i,j=1

This functional is of class C1 and its critical points are the solutions to the system (1.1). The block-wise nontrivial solutions belong to the set

N := {u  H : u¯h = 0 and u¯h J (u)u¯h = 0 for all h = 1, . . . , q}. Note that

u¯h J (u)u¯h = u¯h 2 -

if u  N .

Definition 2.1. A block-wise nontrivial solution u to the system (1.1) such that J (u) = infN J will be called a least energy block-wise nontrivial solution.

In fact, we will show that any minimizer of J on N is a critical point of J , i.e., a block-wise nontrivial solution to (1.1). We follow the approach introduced in [9].

Lemma 2.2. (i) There exists d0 > 0 such that minh=1,...,q u¯h 2  d0 for every (u¯1, . . . , u¯q)  N . As a consequence, we have that N is closed in H and infuN J (u) > 0.

(ii) There exists d1 > 0 independent of (ij) such that

Proof. (i) : If (u¯1, . . . , u¯q)  N , the Ho¨lder and the Sobolev inequalities yield

u¯h 2 

ij|ui|p|uj|p  C u¯h 2p for every h = 1, . . . , q.

(i,j)Ih 

Hence, there exists d0 > 0 such that u¯h 2  d0 for every h = 1, . . . , q. (ii) : Fix ih  Ih such that ihih = max{ii : i  Ih}. Let

M := {(v1, . . . , vq)  Hq : vh = 0,

and the inequality in (ii) follows.

Given u = (u¯1, . . . , u¯q)  H and s = (s1, . . . , sq)  (0, )q, we write

su := (s1u¯1, . . . , squ¯q).

Let Sh := {u¯  Hh : u¯ = 1} and T := S1 × · · · × Sq. Define U := {u  T : su  N for some s  (0, )q}.

Arguing as in [9, Proposition 3.1 and Theorem 3.3] one obtains the following two lemmas. We include their proof for the sake of completeness.
Lemma 2.3. (i) Let u  T . If there exists su  (0, )q such that suu  N , then su is unique and satisfies
J (suu) = max J (su).
s(0,)q

(ii) U is an nonempty open subset of T , and the map U  (0, )q given by u  su is continuous.
(iii) The map U  N given by u  suu is a homeomorphism.
(iv) If (un) is a sequence in U and un  u  U , then |sun|  . Proof. Given u  H we define Ju : (0, )q  R by Ju(s) := J (su). Then

sh hJu(s) = u¯h J (su)[shu¯h], h = 1, . . . , q.

So, if u¯h = 0 for every h = 1, . . . , q, then su  N iff s is a critical point of Ju. The function Ju can be written as

Ju(s) =

(i,j)Ih×Ih ij  |ui|p|uj |p and du,hk :=

(i) : If u  T , then au,h > 0. Assumption (B1) implies that bu,h > 0 and du,hk  0. By [9, Lemma 2.2], if Ju has a critical point su  (0, ), then it is unique and it is a global maximum of Ju in (0, )q.
(ii) : Let v1, . . . , vq  H be such that vh h = 1 and vh and vk have disjoint supports if h = k, and let sh := (h,h  |vh|2p)-1/(2p-2). Set u¯h := (0, . . . , 0, vh), u := (u¯1, . . . , u¯q) and s := (s1, . . . , sq). Then, u  T and su  N . Hence, U = .
As au,h, bu,h, du,hk are continuous functions of u, [9, Lemma 2.3] implies that U is open and that the map U  (0, )q given by u  su is continuous.
(iii) : It follows from (ii) that the map U  N given by u  suu is continuous. Its inverse is

(u¯1, . . . , u¯q) 

u¯1 u¯1

,...,

u¯q u¯q

,

which is well defined and continuous. (iv) : Let (un) be a sequence in U such that un  u  U. If the sequence
(sun) were bounded, after passing to a subsequence we would have sun  s. Since N is closed, this would imply that su  N and, hence, that u  U. This is impossible because U is open in T .

Define  : U  R by

(2.1)

(u)

(suu)

.

As U is an open subset of the smooth Hilbert submanifold T of H, we may ask

whether  is differentiable. As we shall see below, it is in fact C1. We write

(u)  for the the norm of (u) in the cotangent space Tu(T ) to T at u,

i.e.,

(u)



:= sup |(u)v| ,

vTu(U )

v

v=0

where Tu(U) is the tangent space to U at u.
Recall that a sequence (un) in U is called a (P S)c-sequence for  if (un)  c and (un)   0, and  is said to satisfy the (P S)c-condition if every such sequence has a convergent subsequence. Similarly, a (P S)c-sequence for J is a sequence (un) in H such that J (un)  0 and J (un) H-1  0, and J satisfies the (P S)c-condition if any such sequence has a convergent subsequence.

Lemma 2.4. (i)   C1(U, R),

(u)v = J (suu)[suv] for all u  U and v  Tu(U ),

and there exists d0 > 0 such that d0 J (suu) H-1  (u)   |su| J (suu) H-1 for all u  U ,

where |s| = max{|s1|, . . . , |sq|} if s = (s1, . . . , sq).

8

(ii) If (un) is a (P S)c-sequence for , then (sunun) is a (P S)c-sequence for J.

(iii) u is a critical point of  if and only if suu is a critical point of J .

(iv) If (un) is a sequence in U and un  u  U, then (un)  .
Proof. (i) : Let u  U, v  Tu(U), and  : (-, )  U be smooth and such that (0) = u and (0) = v. Fix t  (-, ). Recalling that J (suu) = maxs(0,)q J (su) and applying the mean value theorem to the function   J (s(t)( t)) we obtain

((t)) - (u) = J (s(t)(t)) - J (suu)  J (s(t)(t)) - J (s(t)u) = t J (s(t)(1t)) [s(t)(1t)]

for some 1  (0, 1). Similarly, ((t)) - (u)  t J (su(2t)) [su(2t)]

for some 2  (0, 1). Therefore,

(u)v

=

lim
t0

((t)) - t

(u)

=

J

(suu)[suv].

It follows that  is of class C1 in U.
As Tu(U ) = {(v¯1, . . . , v¯q)  H : u¯h, v¯h = 0 for each h = 1, . . . , q}, we have that H = Tu(U )  {(t1u¯1, . . . , tqu¯q) : ti  R} for every u = (u¯1, . . . , u¯q)  U . Since suu  N and sh > 0, we conclude that

sup J (suu)[suv] = sup J (suu)[w] .

On the other hand, for every v  Tu(U), v = 0, we have that

where su = (su,1, . . . , su,q). By Lemma 2.2, minh=1,...,q su,h  d0 for every u  U. Taking the supremum over all v  Tu(U), v = 0, we obtain the inequalities stated in (i).
Statements (ii) and (iii) follow immediately from (i), and statement (iv) follows from Lemma 2.3(iv) and (2.1).

Theorem 2.5. Assume (A1) and (B1). If J satisfies the (P S)c0 -condition at c0 := infN J , then the system (1.1) has a least energy block-wise nontrivial solution.

9

Proof. Let (wn) be a minimizing sequence for  in U. Lemma 2.4(iv) implies that U is positively invariant under the negative pseudogradient flow of , so the
deformation lemma [21, Lemma 5.15] and Ekeland's variational principle [21,
Lemma 8.5] hold true and we may assume that (wn) is a (P S)c0-sequence for . As J satisfies the (P S)c0-condition, we derive from Lemmas 2.4(ii) and 2.3(iii) that, passing to a subsequence, wn  w and w is a minimum of . Then u := sww is a minimum of J on N and Lemma 2.4(iii) asserts that it is a critical point of J .

Proof of Theorem 1.1. A standard argument shows that, if assumption (A2) holds true, then J satisfies the (P S)c0 -condition. So this result follows from Theorem 2.5.

3 Existence of a fully nontrivial solution

We assume thoughout (A1) and (B1). Our aim is to show that, if (B2) holds true, no semitrivial function in N can be a minimizer of J on N .
Let u  N be semitrivial. To simplify notation we assume that

(3.1)

u = (0, u2, . . . , u) = (u¯1, . . . , u¯q)

Given   H and  > 0 define

with ui  Hi, u¯h  Hq.

u := (u¯,1, u¯2, . . . , u¯q) with u¯,1 := (, u2, . . . , u1 )  H1. Set I^1 := I1 {1} and I^h := Ih if h = 2, . . . , q. Lemma 3.1. There exist 0 > 0 and a C1-map t : (-0, 0)  (0, )q satisfying t()u  N , t(0) = (1, . . . , 1) and t(0) = (0, . . . , 0). Proof. For   R and t = (t1, . . . , tq)  (0, )q define

The Jacobian matrix of F with respect to t at the point (0, 1) is strictly diagonally dominant, i.e.

The Levy-Desplanques theorem asserts that a strictly diagonally dominant matrix is non-singular. So, by the implicit function theorem, there exist 0 > 0 and a C1-map t : (-0, 0)  (0, )q satisfying t(0) = 1,

4 Systems with symmetries
Let G be a closed subgroup of the group O(N ) of linear isometries of RN and denote by Gx := {gx : g  G} the G-orbit of x  RN . Assume that  is G-invariant, i.e., Gx   for every x  . Then, a function u :   R is called G-invariant if it is constant on Gx for every x  . Define
HG := {u  H : u is G-invariant},

17

where, as before, H is either H01() or D01,2(). Further, let  : G  Z2 := {-1, 1} be a continuous homomorphism of groups
and let K := ker  be its kernel. Assume
() there exists x0   such that Kx0 = Gx0.
A function u :   R is called -equivariant if u(gx) = (g)u(x) for every g  G and x  . Define
H := {u  H : u is -equivariant}.
Assumption () guarantees that this space has infinite dimension. Moreover, it implies that K = G, i.e., that  is surjective. Therefore, every nontrivial -equivariant function is nonradial and changes sign.
By the principle of symmetric criticality [21, Theorem 1.28] the critical points of the restriction of J to the either (HG) or to (H) are critical poins of J , i.e., they solve system (1.1). Clearly, all results in the previous sections go through if we take H to be one of these spaces. So Theorems 2.5, 1.1 and 1.2 hold true for HG and H as well.
Next, we give some applications.

4.1 Systems in bounded domains

Let G be a closed subgroup of O(N ) and  a G-invariant domain. Let G1 () be the first eigenvalue of - in H01()G and d := min{dim(Gx) : x  }. Then we have the following result.

Theorem

4.1.

If



is

bounded,

i

>

-G1 (),

1

<

p

<

N -d N -d-2

when

N

>

d + 2,

and (ij ) satisfies (B1) and (B2), the system



(4.1)

-ui + iui =  ij |uj|p|ui|p-2ui,

ui  H01(),

j=1
i = 1, . . . , ,

has a fully nontrivial solution whose components are positive and G-invariant. Moreover, if there exists a continuous homomorphism of groups  : G  Z2
satisfying (), then (4.1) has has a fully nontrivial solution whose components
are -equivariant and, thus, change sign.

Proof.

It is shown in [11, Corollary 2] that, if  is bounded and 1 < p <

N -d N -d-2

,

the embedding H01()G  Lp() is compact. So Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 yield

a least energy fully nontrivial solution (u1, . . . , u) with ui  H01()G. As

|u|  H01()G for every u  H01()G, (|u1|, . . . , |u|) is also a least energy fully

nontrivial solution.

On the other hand, since dim(Kx) = dim(Gx) for all x  , H01()K  Lp() is also compact and, as H01()  H01()K , the embedding H01()  Lp() is compact. So Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 yield a least energy fully nontrivial

solution (u1, . . . , u) with ui  H01(). Since  is surjective, ui changes sign.

18

Note that this result includes the case when  has no symmetries. Then d = 0 and the system is subcritical. Observe also that the system is supercritical if d  1.
For highly symmetric domains Theorem 4.1 yields infinitely many solutions.

Theorem

4.2.

If



is

a

ball

or

an

annulus,

i

>

-1(),

1

<

p

<

N N -2

and (ij) satisfies (B1) and (B2), the system (4.1) has infinitely many fully

nontrivial solutions. All components of one of them are radial and positive, and

all components of the rest are nonradial and change sign.

Proof. For each m  N let Gm be the group generated by m := the rotation by

 2m

on

R2

acting

on

the

first

factor

of

R2 × RN-2

 RN ,

and

let

m

: Gm

 Z2

be the homomorphism given by m(m) := -1. Theorem 4.1 applied to O(N )

yields a fully nontrivial solution whose components are positive and radial, and

applied to m yields a fully nontrivial solution whose components um,i satisfy

um,i(mx, y) = -um,i(x, y) for every (x, y)  R2 × RN-2.

Hence, um,i is nonradial and it changes sign. It is easy to see that um,i = un,i if m = n.

4.2 Subcritical systems in exterior domains

Let G be a closed subgroup of O(N ) such that the G-orbit Gx of every point x  RN {0} is an infinite set, and let  be a G-invariant exterior domain (i.e., RN  is bounded, possibly empty). Under these assumptions we have the
following result.

Theorem

4.3.

If

i

>

0,

1

<

p

<

N N -2

and

(ij )

satisfies

(B1)

and

(B2),

the

system (4.1) has a fully nontrivial solution whose components are positive and

G-invariant.

If, in addition, there exists a continuous homomorphism of groups  : G 

Z2 satisfying (), then (4.1) has has a fully nontrivial solution whose components

are -equivariant and, thus, change sign.

Proof. Since the G-orbit of every point x  RN {0} is an infinite set, the
embedding H01()G  Lp() is compact [9, Lemma 4.3]. If K = ker , the K-orbit of every x  RN {0} is also infinite. Hence, H01()K  Lp() is also compact and so is H01()  H01()K  Lp(). The result now follows from Theorems 1.1 and 1.2.

Theorem 1.4 is a special case of this result.

Proof of Theorem 1.4. The first statement follows from Theorem 4.3 with  = RN and G = O(N ).
For the second one we take G to be the group generated by K  {}, where
K := O(2)×O(2)×O(N -2) and  is the reflection given by (x, y, z) := (y, x, z) for (x, y, z)  R2 × R2 × RN-4, N  4. Note that the K-orbit of x¯ = (x, y, z)

19

is S|1x| × S|1y| × S|Nz|-5, where Srn-1 := {x  Rn : |x| = r}. So Kx¯ is infinite for every x¯ = 0 if N = 5. Let  be the homomorphism given by (g) = 1 if g  K and () = -1. The result now follows from Theorem 4.3.
The latter symmetries were introduced in [3] to prove existence of nonradial solutions to a Schr¨odinger equation, see also [21, Theorem 1.37].

4.3 Entire solutions of critical systems
In the critical case linear group actions do not provide compactness. One needs to consider conformal actions.
Let  be a closed subgroup of O(N + 1). Then  acts isometrically on the unit sphere SN := {x  RN+1 : |x| = 1}. The stereographic projection  : SN  RN  {} induces a conformal action of  on RN , given by
(, x)  x, where  :=   -1  -1 : RN  RN ,

which is well defined except at a single point. The group  acts on the Sobolev space D1,2(RN ) by linear isometries as follows:
u := | det |1/2 u  , for any    and u  D1,2(RN );

see [8, Section 3]. Set D1,2(RN ) := {u  D1,2(RN ) : u = u for all   }.

The argument in [8, Lemma 3.2] shows that this space is infinite dimensional if  = SN for every   SN . If  :   Z2 is a continuous homomorphism of groups satisfying (), we define
D1,2(RN ) := {u  D1,2(RN ) : u = ()u for all   }.

Clearly, Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 hold true for D1,2(RN ) and D1,2(RN ) as well.

Proof of Theorem 1.5. Let  = O(m) × O(n) with m + n = N + 1 and m, n  2

act

on

RN +1



Rm × Rn

in

the

obvious

way.

Then

D1,2(RN )



L

2N N -2

(RN

)

is

a compact embedding [8, Proposition 3.3 and Example 3.4]. So Theorems 1.1

and 1.2 yield a fully nontrivial least energy solution whose components belong

to D1,2(RN ). Replacing each component by its absolute value gives a solution

whose components are positive. To prove the second statement we write RN+1  R2 × R2 × RN-3 and

consider the group  generated by K := O(2) × O(2) × O(N - 3) and the reflection given by (x, y, z) := (y, x, z) for (x, y, z)  R2 × R2 × RN-3, and we

take  to be the homomorphism defined by (g) = 1 if g  K and () = -1.

Then

D1,2(RN )K



L

2N N -2

(RN

)

is

a

embedding

if

N

=

5,

and Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 yield a fully nontrivial solution whose components

belong to D1,2(RN ).

5 Synchronized solutions of cooperative systems

Throughout this section we assume that the system (1.1) is purely cooperative. We also assume that i =  for all i.
Let u be a nontrivial solution to the equation

-u + u = |u|2p-2u, u  H,

Then u = (c1u, . . . , cu) is a solution to the system (1.1) iff c = (c1, . . . , c)  R
solves the algebraic system (1.2). The solutions to (1.2) are the critical points of the C1-function J : R  R defined by

J (c)

:=

1 2

|c|2

-

1 2p



ij |cj |p|ci|p,

i,j=1


with |c|2 := c2i .
i=1

The nontrivial ones belong to the set

M := {c  R : c = 0, J(c), c = 0},

which is a closed C1-submanifold of R. Hence, there exists c  M such that

min J = J(c)
M
and c is a solution to the algebraic system (1.2). Observe that



J(c), c = |c|2 -

ij |cj |p|ci|p

i,j=1

and so

J (c)

=

p-1 p

|c|2

for any c  M.

Following the idea we used to prove Theorem 1.2, we analyze whether all

components of a minimizing solution to (1.2) are nontrivial.

Lemma 5.1. Let c = (c1, . . . , c)  M be such that J(c) = minM J.

(i) If p < 2, then ci = 0 for every i = 1, . . . , .

(ii) If p = 2, then j=i ij c2j  1 for every i = 1, . . . , .
Proof. (i) : Let p < 2 and assume by contradiction that one component of c is zero, say c1 = 0. Set c := (, c2, . . . , c). As c  M , we have

|c|2 = c2i =

ij |cj |p|ci|p.

i2

i,j2

Hence, there exists 0 > 0 such that for every   (-0, 0) there is a unique t = t() > 0 solving

t2 2 + c2i
i2

= t2p 112p + 2p 1j |cj |p +

ij |cj |p|ci|p

j2

i,j2

= t2p 112p + 2p 1j |cj |p + c2i ,

i2

21

namely,

t() =

2 + |c|2 112p + 2p j2 1j |cj |p + |c|2

1 2p-2
.

Moreover,   t() is a C1-function, t(0) = 1 and t(0) = 0. So, if p < 2, then

t()

p

which is a contradiction. (ii) : Let p = 2 and assume by contradiction that j=i ij c2j > 1 for some
i. Then, as c satisfies (1.2), we have that ci = 0. Let us assume, for simplicity,
that i = 1. Then, defining c and t() as before we have that

This is a contradiction.

These computations highlight the different behavior of the system for p < 2 and p = 2. To complete the picture observe that, if p > 2, then

Therefore

= p - 1 -2 + o(2) . p

We conjecture that for p > 2 there is no fully synchronized solution.

Proof of Theorem 1.6. This result follows immediately from Lemma 5.1(i).
