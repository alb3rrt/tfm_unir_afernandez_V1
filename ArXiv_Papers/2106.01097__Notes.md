## Abstract

platform with a hardware configuration consisting of Nvidia Tesla K80(CUDA), 4 core CPU, 15GB RAM running on an isolated Google Cloud Platform instance. The empirical results show that the model improves in performance while adding topics to BERT and an accuracy rate of 90.81% on sentiment classification using BERT with the proposed approach.
