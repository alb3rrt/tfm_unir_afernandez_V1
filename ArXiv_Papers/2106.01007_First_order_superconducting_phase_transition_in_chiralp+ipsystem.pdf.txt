I. INTRODUCTION
Chiral superconductors constitute a class of unconventional superconductors whose order parameter features finite angular momentum and a phase that winds around the Fermi surface [1]. The chiral nature of the gap function arises from spontaneously broken time reversal symmetry (TRS), which yields a two-fold degenerate superconducting state with broken U (1) × Z2-symmetry. Chiral superconductors are of fundamental interest because they are predicted to display topological properties such as Majorana modes in vortex cores and edge currents leading to a quantized thermal Hall conductance [2­5].
The prototypical chiral p-wave superfluid state is realized in A-phase of superfluid 3He [6­8]. The search for chiral p-wave pairing in a bulk superconductor has been going on since the discovery of superfluid 3He. For many years, the leading candidate has been the extensively investigated superconductor Sr2RuO4; a highly anisotropic layered material with tetragonal crystal structure and strong spin-orbit coupling [9­13]. ARPES-measurements have revealed three bands crossing the Fermi-surface, supporting a multi-component theory [14]. Several groups have also found that in zero field there is a single phase transition, where TRS is broken along with the onset of superconductivity [10, 11, 15, 16], while split transitions were reported to arise under strain [17]. However the evidence against the chiral p-wave superconductivity has been growing in recent years. The first notable example was the absence of chiral edge currents that should produce magnetic signatures at the boundary between domains of opposite chirality [18­20]. Recently, the mounting evidence against the chiral p-wave pairing lead to the discussion of other order parameters in an attempt to reconcile all the experimental data, such as near-degenerate between d- and g-wave pairing for Sr2RuO4 [21, 22]. Recent studies of ultrasound [23, 24], and vortex state [25] point to multicomponent order parameter.
Another candidate for chiral triplet superconductivity is the type-II heavy fermion superconductor UPt3 [26­ 28]. Unlike Sr2RuO4, it is claimed to feature two separate phase transitions in zero applied magnetic field, where TRS is spontaneously broken within the superconduct-

ing phase [29­31]. The superconducting state in UPt3 is believed to be chiral f -wave with an order parameter that has the two-dimensional irreducible representation E2u [32]. Although this is a higher order pairing than chiral p-wave, our theoretical description will be relevant for UPt3 since the order parameter symmetry group has the same irreducible representation. In more recent works, chiral superconductivity has also been claimed in other systems, such as Van der Waals materials and nano tubes [33­35].
Even after decades of research, the nature of multicomponent superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 remains a puzzle. This fact and the emergence of new candidates for chiral superconductors raise the need to understand the nature of superconducting phase transition in a chiral p-wave superconductor beyond mean-field approximations and possible clues it may yield in real materials.
The question of fluctuations in a chiral p-wave superconductor is nontrivial because it breaks two symmetries: U (1) and Z2. Therefore, in general, fluctuations can cause a single transition or a sequence of transitions. A similar question arises for s + is superconductors, that shares the U (1) × Z2 symmetry and has been studied by numerical methods [36, 37]. Recent experiments reported fluctuations-induced splitting of the phase transition [38]. Analogous questions for chiral p-wave superconductors were studied in [39], but no Monte-Carlo calculations were performed for this problem. In this paper, we use large-scale Monte-Carlo calculations to study the phase transition a chiral two-component superconductor transition in Ginzburg Landau (GL)-theory for an E2u order parameter. Before we proceed to calculations, we note that the problem is related to the more general question of the phase transitions in multicomponent gauge theories, where large-scale Monte-Carlo studies were performed. For a U (1) × U (1) two-component London superconductor, it has been shown that for moderate values of the gauge charge and equal amplitudes in the two ordering fields there is a single first order phase transition where both symmetries are broken at the same temperature. For high values of the gauge charge the single transition line splits into two separate transitions predicting an intermediate metallic superfluid with broken global U (1) symmetry but restored local U (1) symmetry [40­44]. In Refs. [40, 45] the merg-

2

ing of the two phase transitions was coined a preemptive phase-transition, where ordering in one symmetry sector of the model leads to ordering in the other. For the case of interacting U (1) × U (1) neutral superfluid a detailed study of the first order character of the phase transition was presented in [42], where also the existence of a tricritical point was reported. Similarly, for a SU (2)-symmetric model, where the amplitudes of the two matter fields (1, 2) are related by a CP1 constraint |1|2 + |2|2 = 1, a single transition was found for moderate values of the gauge charge, which split into two transitions for higher values [46, 47]. The model we consider in this paper is different from a U (1) × U (1) London superconductor, due to the presence of a term that explicitly breaks the global U (1) symmetry down to a Z2-symmetry. It is also different from s + is superconductor due to the structure of a so-called mixed gradient terms (MGT). These terms are products of two gradient terms, as in the standard kinetic energy, but where the two factors are gradients in different directions involving different order-parameter components (see below). Such terms are common for chiral p-wave superconductors [48] and can also originate for instance with spin-orbit coupling [49]. Such terms will provide an additional direct coupling between the U (1)- and Z2-symmetry sectors of the model.

II. MODEL

A. Ginzburg Landau model

We consider a superconductor with tetragonal crystal
structure and spin orbit coupling, belonging to the point
group D4h. Gauge invariance and TRS yields the full symmetry group of the system G = D4h × U (1) × Z2. In the two-dimensional odd-parity representation E2u, the superconducting gap function may be written as d(k) =
(xkx + yky)z^. The complex matter fields (components) describe two types of Cooper pairs in the theory, and can
be written in terms of an amplitude and a phase on the form i = ieii . This leads to a GL energy functional E = f d3r where the dimensionless energy density is
given by [48, 50, 51]

The matter fields are minimally coupled to the gauge
field A through covariant derivatives D =  - igA
and the energy is normalized to the condensation energy Bc2/4. The decay of magnetic fields in this model usually involves multiple modes and multiple length scales
[52], that yields further differences compared to s + is

models previously studied in Monte-Carlo simulations [36, 37]. These are parametrized by the gauge-charge through g. In what follows we will not distinguish between the subdominant electromagnetic scales.
The mean field ground state of Eq. (1) is found by setting A = 0 and ignoring spatial variations in the matter fields. Minimization of the potential energy in Eq. (1a) then yields the ground state



|x| = |y| = u0 -   0,

(2)

x - y = ±/2  0.

(3)

We find two degenerate solutions due to the phaselocking term. Theses are related by a Z2 symmetry operation which will be discussed in more detail in Sec. II C. Finally, we note that this ground state gives an order parameter on the form kx ± iky, corresponding to a superconducting state with chiral p-wave pairing which spontaneously breaks the U (1) × Z2 symmetry of the theory.

B. The London limit

In order to perform Monte Carlo simulations on the free energy introduced in Eq. (1), we will work within the London approximation where the amplitudes of the matter fields are frozen. The London limit is commonly used for similar models [40, 41]. However, in the case of a multi-component order parameter, and with the addition of Ising anisotropy and MGT, such an approach requires considerable care and is generally not applicable [52].
We will first explicitly assess the validity of this approach, following a similar but not identical method to the one presented in [52]. To this end, we expand all fluctuating fields to second order in deviations from their mean-field values, introducing

i = i - 0,

(4)

 = 2 (x - y - 0) ,

(5)

1

pi = Ai - g i,

(6)

 = (x + y)/2,

(7)

where pi essentially is a gauge-invariant current. Expanding the energy to second order in these fluctuations and Fourier transforming, we obtain an expression on the form

f = f0 + vGv,

(8)

3

where f0 is the ground state energy, G(k) is a matrix describing the coupling between fluctuations in different fields and v is the fluctuation vector given by

v(k) = + -  px py .

(9)

We have introduced a rotated amplitude basis ± = ( x ± y)/ 2 in order to simplify the structure of the coupling matrix. The exact form of the coupling matrix, along with details of the derivation are given in Appendix A.
To determine what fluctuations are most important, the coupling matrix is diagonalized to obtain the lowest eigenvalue  along with the corresponding eigenvector . In the absence of MGT, the coupling matrix is already diagonal and the eigenvectors are pure modes with fluctuations in only one field. In the long wavelength limit, we then find that the phase-difference mode  corresponds to the lowest eigenvalue for low values of the Ising anisotropy

  0.17

(10)

when  = u0 = g = 1.0. Above this value amplitude fluctuations become important as the - mode corresponds to the lowest eigenvalue. The effect of MGT is that the eigenvectors become mixed modes with multiple non-zero entries for non-zero momentum [52]. To investigate the degree of mixing, we plot the k-dependence of the nonzero entries in  in Fig. 1b with the corresponding parameters without MGT in Fig. 1a. For low momentum magnitude k the phase difference mode is now weakly mixed with + amplitude fluctuations, but phase difference fluctuations are still dominant.
Note that although taking a London limit eliminates some of the mixing at the level of bare model, we find below that the phase transition is first order, so in a fluctuating model the mixing should reappear at the level of a large-scale effective field theory. Otherwise, at the level of bare model, the London limit is a good approximation for the regime of small mixing.

C. Charged and chiral symmetry sectors

In this section we introduce the chiral basis, which
is obtained by a unitary transformation ± = (x ± iy)/ 2. Under TRS, the chiral components transform as K^± =  . It is common to recast the model in terms of these chiral components [51, 53, 54], but in the present
setting we introduce them because they provide an or-
der parameter in the Z2 symmetry sector. If we calculate the chiral component amplitudes in terms of the
xy-components, we find

|±| =

(11)

By inserting the ground state values form Eqs. (2) and (3), we see that one of the chiral amplitudes is spontaneously chosen. Coming from the low-temperature

In (a) there are no MGT and the coupling matrix is diagonal with pure modes. In (b) we have included MGT, which cause mixed modes with fluctuations in multiple fields. In both cases fluctuations in the phase difference are dominant in the long wavelength limit.
regime, chiral symmetry is then restored by a proliferation of topological defects in the form of Ising domain walls separating areas of opposite chirality. From Eq. (11) we see that these domain walls can be described by a gradient in the phase-difference of the xycomponents.
The superconducting phase transition is associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking of the local U (1)symmetry. The low temperature phase is well understood at mean-field level, where the gauge field A acquires a mass, yielding a Meissner-effect. In the context of singlecomponent superconductors it has been shown that going beyond mean-field, the (non-local) order parameter of the U (1)-sector is still the gauge field mass, which now corresponds to the inverse magnetic penetration length of the problem. Upon heating the system, the mass of the gauge field is eventually destroyed at some critical temperature. The phase transition is driven by a proliferation of thermally excited topological defects in the form of charged vortex-loops [55, 56].
In the London limit, we can perform a separation of variables to rewrite the model in terms of charged and chiral terms

This form highlights the interplay between the symmetry sectors of the model in an intuitive way. We have the charged sector given by the phase-sum coupling to a gauge field with strength 2g. The chiral sector is governed by the phase-difference, where we have a 3D XYmodel with an easy axis anisotropy that demotes the symmetry from global U (1) down to Z2. Then finally there are the MGT that provide an explicit coupling between the two sectors. Note that even in the absence of MGT, the two symmetry sectors are still connected as the phase-sum and phase-difference are not independent variables.

III. MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS

The critical properties of the model in Eq. (1) in the London limit are investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. This is achieved by discretizing the model on a numerical cubic lattice, where the matter-fields live on lattice points and the gauge field is discretized through renormalized non-compact link-variables [57]. Periodic boundary conditions are used because we are interested in bulk properties of the model. In simulations, we use the Metropolis Hastings algorithm with a local update scheme and parallel tempering between different temperatures to numerically evaluate various observables [58­ 60]. The gauge-field is discretized through renormalized non-compact link-variables defined as

1 r+µ^

Aµ(r ) dr  (-, ),

(13)

for µ  {x, y, z}. These are non-compact in the sense that they don't have a 2 periodicity [57] and this means that the discretization of the pure gauge term in Eq. (1b) will have the form

where ( × A)µ = µ Ar, using the Levi-Civita symbol and summation over repeated indices. µ is a discrete forward difference operator such that µAr, = Ar+µ^, - Ar, . We note that writing out the sums over µ,  and , Eq. (14) can be written in term of plaquette sums. The link variables are renormalized in the sense that we multiply the field by a factor -1/g to simplify the covariant derivatives.
The covariant derivatives are discretized using forward difference where the order-parameter component value at

r + µ^ is parallel-transported back to r by the gauge-field link variables by

Dµa(r)  ra+µ^e-iAr,µ - ra.

(15)

This ensures that the resulting lattice-discretized GLtheory remains invariant under the gauge-transformation

ra  eir ra Ar,µ  Ar,µ + µr,

(16)

where r is an arbitrary real field. The resulting lattice theory is, from a renormalization
point of view, a member of the same universality class as the continuum GL-model and is therefore expected to yield the same quantitative behaviour, at least in strongly type-II regime [61]. The remaining expressions for the discretized effective free energy density f r are presented in Appendix B.
To measure ordering in each of the symmetry sectors at the phase transition, we introduce two order parameters. As discussed in section II C, the Z2 transition is characterized by an imbalance between the chiral components introduced in Eq. (11). Hence, we can measure spontaneous symmetry-breaking of TRS using the chiral amplitude difference

1 ± = L3

|+(r)|2 - |-(r)|2 .

This is zero in the high-temperature phase and tends to
220 in the low-temperature phase. The superconducting phase is characterized by a non-zero gauge field mass m = -L1. This can be computed via the dual stiffness [41]

q2  q2 + -L2 .
(18)

The low q-limit of this expression tends to zero in the su-

perconducting phase, where L is finite, and some constant in the normal state, where L is infinite. Hence, we measure the dual stiffness at the lowest non-zero mo-

mentum allowed by our discretization as an order param-

eter in the U (1)-symmetry sector. Finally, both phase-

transitions are accompanied by singularities in the spe-

cific heat

Cv = 2 (E - E )2 ,

(19)

where  is the inverse temperature.

5
In numerical simulations, we thermalise systems of sizes up to 323 from both an ordered state given by Eqs. (2) and (3), or fully disordered states in some cases, over 3 × 105 Monte Carlo sweeps. We then make measurements of the energy, dual stiffness and chiral order parameter over 1 × 106 Monte Carlo sweeps. The measurements are done every 40'th sweep to account for the auto-correlation time. Ferrenberg-Swendsen multi histogram reweighting has been used to post-process the raw data [62, 63].

IV. RESULTS
In this section we present results from large scale Monte Carlo simulations using the parameter regime discussed in Sec. II B. For all simulations we have fixed  = 1.0, u0 = 1.0 and g = 1.0.

A. Model without mixed gradient terms

Results without MGT, m = 0, are shown in Fig. 2. We find that ordering in both symmetry sectors occurs simultaneously. In Fig. 2a the chiral order parameter has a kink as it drops to zero at the critical temperature. The dual stiffness in Fig. 2b displays similar behaviour; in the Meissner phase, where L is finite, it tends to zero and in the normal state it grows, as the thermal gauge fluctuations become larger. The normal phase and Meissner phase are separated by a jump in both order parameters accompanied by a singularity in the specific heat in Fig. 2c. In summary, we find that with decreasing temperature the system goes from a normal state to a chiral superconducting state with spontaneously broken U (1) × Z2 symmetry.
The fact that they coincide is explained by a preemptive phase transition scenario, discussed previously for multi-component superfluids and superconductors [40, 45], see the earlier discussion in terms of j-currents in [42]. The process of proliferating topological defects in the two symmetry sectors is cooperative. Namely, as the charged vortices in the U (1)-sector proliferate, the stiffness of the Ising domain walls drops to zero triggering a proliferation in the Z2 sector. The smoking gun signature of a preemptive phase transition is that it is first order, with a latent heat related to the sudden drop in the chiral/charged order parameters at the phase transition. An intuitive way of understanding this is to consider the case where the two symmetry sectors are completely decoupled. The chiral sector is then, with increasing temperature, headed towards a continuous second order phase transition in the Ising universality class. At some lower temperature, charged vortices in the U (1)-sector will proliferate which also triggers the Z2 phase transition due to the interplay between domain walls and vortices. This scenario is sketched in Fig. IV A, where the order parameters in both symmetry sectors are cut off at the

preemptive transition temperature resulting in a single first order transition. To investigate this numerically, we plot the energy probability distribution in Fig. 4a. We find a pronounced double peak, indicative of a first order phase transition where two phases co-exist at the critical temperature. Furthermore, we have performed a finite-size scaling analysis of the difference in free energy between the double peak value and the valley minimum F = ln(Pmax/Pmin)/, where Pmax and Pmin are the energy probabilities at the double peak and the valley minimum, respectively. For a first order phase transi-

6 tion, this quantity should scale asymptotically as Ld-1 [64] for large system sizes. Such scaling is confirmed in Fig. 4b.

FIG. 3. Schematic drawing of the preemptive phase transition scenario. The the chiral and charged order parameters would exhibit two separate continuous phase transitions, were it not for the mutual interplay between the two sectors. At some intermediate temperature, interplay between topological defects in the two symmetry sectors lead to ordering in both, resulting in a single first order phase transition at Tc.
B. Full model
We now consider the full model in Eq. (1) and examine how the MGT modify results from the previous section. In Ref. [48] the MGT share coefficient with the Ising anisotropy term, so due to the restrictions on  we stick to low values of m. Fig. 5 shows results for the phase transition at m = 0.1. The results are very similar to the case without MGT, which can be seen by comparing with Fig. 2. The critical temperature decreases slightly, and we can also see that finite size effects become more prominent as the peak in specific heat changes more with system size. To investigate whether this is still a preemptive phase transition, the energy probability distribution along with finite size scaling of F are plotted in Fig. 6. We find a clear double peak and quadratic scaling, which both indicate a first order preemptive phase transition. By comparing with Fig. 4, we observe that the first order behavior is even stronger in case of non-zero MGT, as the double peak structure is now resolved for the smallest system with L = 24.
To characterize the strength of the transition, we calculate the difference in entropy between the two coexisting states at the phase transition. The entropy is calculated from the free energy F = E­T S. Because the two states have the same free energy the entropy difference is given by S = E/Tc  ckb. In Table I we show the coefficient c for the change in entropy per lattice site for

As m is increased further, this trend continues. This can be explained by the fact that the MGT introduce stronger interaction between vortices and domain walls that results in a larger latent heat and stronger first order behaviour.

Appendix A: Coupling matrix
The energy in Eq. (1) is expanded to second order in the fluctuation fields introduced in Eqs. (4)-(6). For the

potential in Eq. (1a), we find

fV = - 

u2x + u2y

+ u0 2

u4x + u4y

- u2xu2y

+ - + 3u0u2x - u2y

2 x

+

- + 3u0u2y - u2x

2 y

- 4uxuy x y + 8u2xu2y2 ,

(A1)

where f0 is the ground state energy. The Maxwell term keeps the exact same form to second order in p, since it only differs by a gradient from A

fA = | × p|2.

(A2)

Finally for the various gradient terms, we expand the gradients to first order since all relevant combinations are squared

Dix = [i x - i(gpi - i)ux] ei(+0/2), Diy = [i y - i(gpi + i)uy] ei(-0/2).

(A3) (A4)

These expressions can now be combined to form all the terms in the energy functional. After Fourier transforming and rotating the amplitude basis, we can write the energy on the form in Eq. (8)

f = f0 + vGv.

(A5)

where v is given in Eq. (9). We can write the coupling matrix as a sum of three contributions, a diagonal part with massive terms, a diagonal part with k-dependant terms and an off-diagonal part from the MGT.

(A7) (A8)

In Eq. (A7), we note that the Meissner effect gives rise to massive gauge-field fluctuations, which yield a massless Goldstone mode associated with the phase-sum when g = 0. The phase-difference mode is also seen to evolve to a massless Goldstone mode when the Ising-anisotropy

parameter  = 0. Furthermore, Eq. (A8) shows that the MGT have an effect for g = 0, coupling fluctuations in the + amplitude mode to fluctuations in the phase difference . Finite g will moreover couple the - amplitude mode to gauge-invariant currents. Contrary to the

10

one-component case, the eigenmodes are in general complicated linear combinations of amplitude modes, phasedifference modes, and gauge-invariant currents [52]. Only in a limited parameter regime do the eigenmodes simplify significantly.

Appendix B: Lattice regularized free energy

In this section we apply the regularization procedure introduced in Section III to the dimensionless effective free energy density in Eq. (1). The resulting expression was used in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to find the energy-difference between different field-configurations as well as when calculating the energy as an observable which again was used in calculating of the specific heat.
Inserting the discretization of the covariant derivative in Eq. (15) yields
|Dµa|2 |ra+µ^|2 + |ra|2 - 2 Re ra+µ^ra e -iAr,µ
2 (ar )2 - ar+µ^ar cos(ra+µ^ - ra - Ar,µ) .
(B1)

In the second line we have introduced the notation ra = ar eira for the amplitude and phase of the components of the order parameter. We have also used periodic boundary conditions to map the term |ra+µ^|2 back to |ra|2 by a simple shift of the index in the sum r fr.
Using the formula above we immediately get the
lattice-regularized conventional kinetic energy density

fKr = reg

|Da|2 = reg |Dµa|2

(ar )2 - ar+µ^ar cos ra+µ^ - ra - Ar,µ ,

(B2)

where µ runs over x, y and z, while a  {x, y}. Using the notation

a¯ =

:a=x :a=y

.

(B3)

the MGT in Eq. (1c) can be written on the more compact form

fMGT = 2m Re Dxa(Dya¯) .

(B4)

Inserting the discretization of covariant derivatives we find in Eq. (15) gives

Dxa(Dya¯) =

(B5)

Taking the real part of this gives

Re Dxa(Dya¯)

= ar+x^ar¯+y^ cos ra+x^ - ra¯+y^ - (Ar,x - Ar,y)

- ar+x^ar¯ cos ra+x^ - ra¯ - Ar,x

- ar¯+y^ar cos ra¯+y^ - ra - Ar,y

+ ar ar¯ cos ra - ra¯ ,

(B6)

This gives the final expression for the discretized MGT

- ar+x^ar¯ cos ra+x^ - ra¯ - Ar,x

(B7) ,

where we have switched the superscripts a  a¯ on the third line. To ensure that this discretized term is rendered invariant under the four-fold rotations of the square numerical lattice, we may average as follows

f

f~Mr GT

1 =

fMr GT + C4fMr GT + C42fMr GT + C43fMr GT

(B8) (B9)

where C4 denotes a 90 degree counterclockwise rotation of the xy-coordinate system. We then find

f~rMGT

=

m 2

ar+x^ar¯+y^ cos ra+x^ - ra¯+y^ - (Ar,x - Ar,y)

a

- ar-x^ar¯+y^ cos ra-x^ - ra¯+y^ + (Ar-x^,x + Ar,y)

+ ar-x^ar¯-y^ cos ra-x^ - ra¯-y^ - (Ar-y^,y - Ar-x^,x)

- ar+x^ar¯-y^ cos ra+x^ - ra¯-y^ - (Ar,x + Ar-y^,y) , (B10)

The potential terms in Eq. (1) are simply discretized by mapping to the amplitude phase-notation and become

fVr =

+  (xr yr )2 cos 2(rx - ry).

(B11)

These expressions together with the regularization of the

pure gauge-potential term in Eq. (14) then give the com-

plete discretized free energy density

f r = fVr + fKr + f~Mr GT + fAr .
