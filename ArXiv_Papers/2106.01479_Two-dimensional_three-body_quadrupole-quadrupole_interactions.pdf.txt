Abstract
Similar to interactions between dipoles, or van der Waals interactions, quadrupole-quadrupole interactions are interactions between quadrupoles. In this article, we study the quadrupole interactions between highly excited atoms or Rydberg atoms. In addition, unlike many other calculations, in which the primary focus was on the one-dimensional two-body quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, the primary aim of this article is to study the two-dimensional few-body quadrupolequadrupole interactions. Specifically, the two-dimensional three-body interactions are investigated. This research has many applications, such as quadrupole-blockade for quantum computing, creating molecules based on quadrupole interactions. PACS numbers: 33.20.Bx, 36.40.Mr, 32.70.Jz

I. INTRODUCTION

Quadrupole-quadrupole interactions have been studied in different areas of research, such

as nuclear physics, ionic or plasma physics, and molecular physics. For example, quadrupole

interactions between molecular rotation and a spinning nucleus have been investigated [1].

Quadrupole-quadrupole interactions between nucleons have been reported, which may give

rise to a variety of collective effects [2]. The quadrupole-quadrupole interactions between

nuclei and impurity paramagnetic ions in metals and alloys were indirectly analyzed through

conduction electrons [3]. It has been shown that the quadrupole-quadrupole interactions

play a crucial role in driving nuclear-excited states [4]. Moreover, density broadening has

been studied in different disciplines. The quadrupolar interactions between two ions have

been examined [5]. Quadrupole-quadrupole interactions have been used to study plasma-

induced transparency [6]. Furthermore, quadrupole-quadrupole interactions contribute to

the C5 coefficient, which has been calculated for Cs [7]. Quadrupole-quadrupole interactions

have been studied in molecules [8, 9]. The angular dependence of quadrupole-quadrupole

interactions is investigated in ultracold gases [10]. However, most of the studies focus on

two-body one-dimensional interactions. In this article, we focus on the three-dimensional

few-body quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, and lower-order interactions, such as dipole-

dipole interactions and dipole-quadrupole interactions among neutral atoms, are ignored.

at higher densities, and quadrupole-quadrupole coupled molecules.

This paper is arranged in the following way: the quadrupole-quadrupole interactions are

presented in the next section, which is followed by the discussions about applications to

different cases.

II. THEORY

Quadrupole-quadrupole interactions can be calculated by expanding the Coulomb interactions between four charges [30]. In this article, we assume the four charges are from two atoms separated by a distance R as shown in Fig. 1. We further assume that the internuclear spacing, R, is much greater than the size of the atoms, r1 and r2. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation is applied. Specifically, the positive ions have zero kinetic energy. The Hamiltonian for this system is





H = - 2µ1 1 - 2µ2 2 + V1 + V2 + V12

(1)

where µ1 and the µ2 are the effective mass of atom 1 and 2, or the bottom atom and the top

atom. The first two terms are the kinetic energy of the two atoms. The third and fourth

terms are the internal Coulomb potential energy within atom 1 and atom 2 respectively,

V1

=

- e2 4 0 r1

and

V2

.

V12

is

the

quadrupole-quadrupole

interactions

four

where Q1 = er12 and Q2 = er22 are the quadrupole moments of atom 1 and atom 2. R is the distance between the two atoms as shown in Fig. 1. C2,q is the second-order spherical tensor in Edmonds [31]. Here q = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. It is shown that if  = 0 and  = 0, Eq. (2) reduces to the one-dimensional quadrupole-quadrupole interactions [10]. In addition, it can be proved that by reversing the R direction shown in Fig. 1,

or changing  to 180o -  and  to  + 180o, the V12 remains the same. Unlike the onedimensional quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, the M, the projection of the total angular momentum of all three atoms in the z-axis, is no longer conserved in the three-dimensional quadrupole-quadrupole interactions. Therefore, the number of matrix elements is significantly increased for the three-dimensional quadrupole-quadrupole interactions compared to the one-dimensional quadrupole-quadrupole interactions.
For three-body quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, the Hamiltonian can be modified from Eq. (1) by adding an additional atom:







H = - 2µ1 1 - 2µ2 2 - 2µ3 3 + V1 + V2 + V3 + Vqq,

Vqq

is the sum of all pair-wise potential energies between the three atoms:

Vqq = V12 + V23 + V31.

(4)

Very similar to the quadrupole-quadrupole interactions between atom 1 and atom 2 shown in Eq. (2), V23 is the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction potential energy between atom 2 and atom 3, and V31 is the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction between atom 3 and atom 1.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this article, we consider two-dimensional three-atom interactions. Specifically, the ddd Rydberg states [19, 20] are considered. The initial state is 34d5/2,1/234d5/2,1/234d5/2,1/2. In other words, three 34d5/2,1/2 atoms are located at the three vertices of an equilateral triangle as shown in Fig. 2. The total number of elements considered is (2+10)3=123=1728, since the number of m states in the s state is 2, and the total number m states in the d states is 10 (4 in the d3/2 states and 6 in the d5/2 states), where m is the projection of the total angular momentum of one atom in the z-axis. The exponential part, 3, comes from the fact that three atoms are considered.
In the right-hand side of Fig. 3, the top energy level is 34d5/234d5/234d5/2 at R=1 µm. The second highest levels are 34d3/234d5/234d5/2, 34d5/234d3/234d5/2, and 34d5/234d5/234d3/2, and all three levels are degenerate. The third levels are 34d3/234d3/234d5/2, 34d5/234d3/234d3/2, and 34d3/234d5/234d3/2, and all three are degenerate. The bottom level is 34d3/234d3/234d3/2

FIG. 1: Two ion cores of the two atoms, atom 1 (the bottom atom) and atom 2 (the top atom), are located at the origins of the two Cartesian coordinates, O and O. The distance between the bottom ion core and the electron of the bottom atom is r1, and the distance between the top ion core and the electron of the top atom is r2. The angle between r1 and the z axis is 1, and the angle between the projection of r1 in the x - y plane and the x axis is 1. The angle between r2 and the z axis is 2, and the angle between the projection of the r2 in the x - y plane and the x axis is 2. The distance between the two ion cores is R, the distance between the two electrons is R, the distance between the ion core of the bottom atom and the electron of the top atom is R, and the distance between the electron of the bottom atom and the ion core of the top atom is R.
FIG. 2: Three atoms are located at the three vertices of an equilateral triangle, and each atom is composed of one ion core and one electron. The distance between two neighboring atoms is R.

at R=1 µm. Similar to other calculations, the energy levels are closely packed at shorter internuclear spacings, and the level structure is sophisticated. However, there are some general features. For example, the bottom level shows purely attractive quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, and some levels show both attractive and repulsive quadrupole-quadrupole interactions. There are still some open areas, which will be transparent for certain frequencies. Such a structure is very useful for creating transparent materials at a certain frequency range and block other frequencies. It is also shown that potential wells can be created through quadrupole-quadrupole interactions in a two-dimensional case. Moreover, potential peaks are observed. Those peaks can be as high as 100 THz or higher, which can possibly be used for quantum information storage.
Fig. 4 shows the principal quantum number n dependence of the maximum frequency shift. Specifically, the maximum repulsive frequency shift at the internuclear spacing R=0.5

FIG. 4: The maximum frequency shift in the higher frequency end at R=0.5 µm ( ) as a function of n8, where n is the principal quantum number. The red line (--) is the linear fit of the calculated data.
µm vs. n8 is plotted. It is shown that the linear fit is very close. The reason is the radius of the atoms is proportional to n2, and each quadrupole moment has r2 in it. Therefore, it is expected that the total shift is proportional to n8.
IV. CONCLUSION
In summary, the three-dimensional quadrupole-quadrupole interaction potential energy is expressed. In addition, this expression is applied to the three atoms located at three vertices of an equilateral triangle, and all three atoms are in the d states. Moreover, the principal quantum number n dependence is investigated. It is shown that the maximum repulsive frequency shift depends on n8.
