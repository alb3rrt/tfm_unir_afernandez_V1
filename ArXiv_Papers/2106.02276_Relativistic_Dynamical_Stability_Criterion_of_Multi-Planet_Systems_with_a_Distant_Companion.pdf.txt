ABSTRACT Multi-planetary systems are prevalent in our Galaxy. The long-term stability of such systems may be disrupted if a distant inclined companion excites the eccentricity and inclination of the inner planets via the eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism. However, the star-planet and the planet-planet interactions can help stabilize the system. Here, we extend the previous stability criterion that considered only the companion-planet and planet-planet interactions by also accounting for short-range forces or effects, specifically, relativistic precession induced by the host star. A general analytical stability criterion is developed for planetary systems with N inner planets and a far-away inclined perturber by comparing precession rates of relevant dynamical effects. Furthermore, we demonstrate as examples that in systems with 2 and 3 planets, the analytical criterion is consistent with numerical simulations using a combination of Gauss's averaging method and direct N-body integration. This new stability criterion extends the parameter space in which inclined companions of multi-planet systems can inhabit.

1. INTRODUCTION
Recent ground and space-based observations suggest that multi-planet systems are abundant in our galaxy (e.g., Lissauer et al. 2011, 2012; Tremaine & Dong 2012; Rowe et al. 2014). There exist many systems with multiple planets on tight orbits (e.g., Howard et al. 2012; Brewer et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2019). The NASA Kepler Mission detected hundreds of multi-planet systems with orbits < 1 au (e.g., Borucki et al. 2011). Some systems even have multiple planets all residing within mercury's semi-major axis, such as the system of TRAPPIST-1 (see Gillon et al. 2017). Additionally, these planets seem to have low eccentricities (e.g. Lithwick et al. 2012; Van Eylen & Albrecht 2015). It is suggested that gravitational interactions between planets in these compact systems helps stabilizing it (e.g. Fang & Margot 2013; Pu & Wu 2015; Volk & Gladman 2015; Pu & Lai 2018; Denham et al. 2019).
Meanwhile, the population of giant planets and massive stellar companions are also substantial. They are

frequently found to inhabit long-period orbits (e.g., Raghavan et al. 2010; Knutson et al. 2014; Konopacky et al. 2016; Bryan et al. 2016; Zhu & Wu 2018; Bryan et al. 2019), as is the case in our solar system. These faraway and massive companions are crucial in shaping the inner orbits' architecture and, in particular, determining the dynamical stability of the system. For example, a giant planet with an inclined and distant orbit can excite eccentricities and inclinations of the inner planets via the eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism through angular momentum exchange (e.g. Takeda & Rasio 2005; Takeda et al. 2008; Naoz 2016; Denham et al. 2019; Pu & Lai 2018).
The presence of such inclined and massive companions may undermine our ability to detect other planets on the inner orbits (e.g. Hansen 2017; Becker & Adams 2017; Mustill et al. 2017). Specifically, the disrupting effect from the outer companion may change the inclinations of inner orbits (e.g. Becker & Adams 2016), inducing them to oscillate out of the transiting plane, leaving

themselves undetectable by the transit method, which is by far the most productive method of detecting exoplanets. Eccentricities of the inner planets may also be excited to such high values that brings about close encounters or orbit crossings, possibly resulting in planets colliding into the star or being ejected out of the system due to the strong gravitational interactions (e.g. Fabrycky & Murray-Clay 2010; Naoz et al. 2012; Li et al. 2014a,c; Fabrycky et al. 2014; Li et al. 2020). Consequently, these misaligned, collided, or ejected planets are no longer detectable.
Previous works have studied the secular (i.e., longterm) perturbations both from distant companions and within compact systems. Specifically, the long-time interactions between adjacent planets are studied dating back to Laplace, Lagrange, and Poincar´e. They found that angular momentum exchange between planets will induce orbital precession, which is later referred to as the Laplace-Lagrange secular theory. The disturbing influence from an inclined distant massive companion is described by the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) effect (Lidov 1962; Kozai 1962; Naoz et al. 2011; Naoz 2016). The EKL mechanism dictates that an inclined perturber1 may excite the eccentricity of an inner planet. However, any effect that causes precession of the inner orbits tends to stabilize the system against the gravitational perturbation from the faraway companion (see Innanen et al. 1997). Angular momentum exchange between the inner planets turns out to be one of the stabilizing effects Denham et al. (2019); Pu & Lai (2018). For example, Denham et al. (2019), focusing on systems with 2 planets and a faraway companion (2 + 1 configuration), derived an analytical criterion and tested the stability of the system. In particular, this method can be used to estimate and constrain the parameter space of a possible hidden companion of an observed multi-planet system.
Aside from the planet-planet interactions, the influence of the star on the stability of the system can not be neglected when the orbits of the planets are close enough to the star. Many such close planets are already observed, such as in planetary systems TRAPPIST-1, Kepler-20, Kepler-42, Kepler-90, to name a few. General relativity (GR) also causes precession of the orbits (where due to the weak field nature of the problem we consider only the first-order post-Newtonian approximation). When the summation of the precession rates of GR and Laplace-Lagrange effect is much faster than that
1 In some cases when both the inner and outer objects are eccentric, a nearly co-planer outer companion can also excite both the eccentricity and inclination of an inner object (see Li et al. 2014b,a).

of EKL's, further eccentricity excitations will be suppressed. However, when the synthesized precession rate of GR and Laplace-Lagrange effect is comparable to or slower than that of EKL's, a resonant-like behavior takes place which tends to excite the eccentricity of the inner member (e.g. Naoz et al. 2013).
In this work, we extend the previous stability criterion derived in Denham et al. (2019) by incorporating short-range forces or effects, such as general relativity, and comparing the precession rates of different effects. Moreover, we generalize the treatment beyond 2 + 1 to general N + 1 systems and show 3 + 1 systems as an example. We find that general relativity indeed suppresses the excitation from the outer companion and helps stabilize the system. The example systems are numerically integrated to test our analytical criterion.
Below we first introduce the interactions and relevant equations in Section 2. Then in Section 3, we develop an analytical stability criterion that predicts the long-time stability of a N + 1 system from its initial conditions by comparing the precession rates of different dynamical effects. Numerical methods used in the rest of this work to test the criterion are introduced in Section 4. As a proof-of-concept, we apply and test the criterion on a set of 2 + 1 systems in Section 5 and 3 + 1 systems in Section 6. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of this study in Section 7.
2. PHYSICAL PROCESSES AND EQUATIONS
Consider a hierarchical system with N inner planets and a distant companion indexed as 1, 2, ..., N for the planets and c for the companion orbiting around a star of mass M . Their corresponding masses, semi-major axes, eccentricities, inclinations, longitude of the periapsides, longitude of the ascending nodes, and true anomalies are denoted by mj, aj, ej, ij, j, j, and j respectively, where the subscript index j ranges from 1 to N for the inner planets and c for the companion. (see Figure 1 for an illustration of the system). Based on the aforementioned observational findings, we assume that the inner planets are initially on tightly packed and nearly circular orbits with small mutual inclinations. We inspect three major mutual interactions within the system that shapes its dynamical features: the companion-planet interaction described by the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) effect, the planet-planet Laplace-Lagrange (LL) secular evolution, and the star-planet general relativistic (GR) interaction. Here, we describe the effects that the three interactions have on planet j and present their associated timescales.

Figure 1. An illustration of the system. We consider N inner planets and a distant companion with masses mj, semimajor axes aj, eccentricities ej, and inclinations ij where the index j ranges from 1 to N for the inner planets, and c for the companion. The inner planets are initially on circular and aligned orbits (i.e., small mutual inclinations). The distant companion is misaligned with respect to the inner planets.

In a hierarchical system, the Hamiltonian can be decomposed into the summation of Keplerian terms and a coupling term describing the interaction between planet j and the companion (see Naoz 2016). This term can be expanded in the power series of aj/ac, which is a small parameter. By expanding the Hamiltonian up to the quadrupole order and with the help of the equations of motion, we find that the z-component of the angular momentum of planet j, Jz = 1 - e2j cos (ij - ic), is conserved. Therefore, the eccentricity and inclination of planet j will oscillate in a trade-off manner due to the presence of the companion. When the eccentricity is excited to extreme values, orbit crossing will happen, therefore destabilizing the system. The associated timescale of the EKL effect from the companion on planet j is (Antognini 2015)

where G is the gravitational constant. Note that this is the shortest timescale for eccentricity excitations (i.e., the quadrupole level expansion). If this short timescale is already suppressed, higher values will also be suppressed.

2.2. Laplace-Lagrange Secular Evolution
The Laplace-Lagrange (LL) secular interaction describes the long-term perturbations between near planets. Consider two inner planets j and k. The LL interac-

These equations were used in Denham et al. (2019) to find the analytical stability criterion2 in the absence of general relativity effects. Here the equations are generalized to account for the influence on planet j from more than one planets.

2 Note that Denham et al. (2019) had a typo in the equivalent equations for the A and B coefficients (Equation (3)-(6)), but it did not propagate into the actual calculations.

In addition to Denham et al. (2019), we find that during relativistic evolution, cos( k - j) and cos(k - j) in Equation (11) can both vary between -1 and 1. Combined with the fact that the integral in Equation (7) and Equation (8) are positive for any given jk between 0 and 1, we can therefore constrain the Laplace-Lagrange precession timescale with an upper and a lower limit by allowing the cosine terms to vary to their limits:

We will soon show in Section 3 that the two limits enclose an area in the parameter space, which is a transition zone between stable and unstable systems. If the change in the orientation of the planet's orbit is fast enough to average out the eccentricity excitations brought by the eccentric Kozai-Lidov effect, the system will remain stable over time (e.g., Denham et al. 2019; Pu & Lai 2018).

2.3. General Relativity
General relativity is another effect that induces orbital precession for close-in planets. When relativistic precession is fast enough, the EKL eccentricity excitation can be suppressed. The associated timescale of planet j is the period for its orbit to precess one cycle (e.g., Misner et al. 1973):

Tj,GR

= 2 c2a5j/2(1 - e2j ) 3 (GM )3/2

.

(14)

The shortest eccentricity excitation timescale due to the perturbations from the companion is proportional to the EKL-quadrupole timescale (i.e., Equation (1)). Therefore, the maximum eccentricity that planet j can be excited to is due to the quadrupole level of the EKL approximation. For an initially circular inner orbit, the maximum eccentricity that planet j can reach throughout its evolution in the presence of GR is determined by the cubic equation

(15)

where Jmin = 1 - e2j,max is the minimum dimensionless angular moment and GR = 1 - e2j TEKL/TGR (e.g., Liu et al. 2015; Naoz 2016). Notice that GR  1 when TGR and TEKL are of comparable magnitude, and ej = 0 in our configuration. It is worth mentioning that if the inner orbit is not initially circular then the resonance nature changes and the maximum eccentricity takes a different value (e.g., Hamers 2020; Hansen & Naoz 2020). Solving for ej,max via Equation (15) and substituting it back in Equation (14) gives the shortest timescale of relativistic precession TGR,min.

(16)

In what follows we generalize the stability criterion developed in Denham et al. (2019) to (1) include GR effects, (2) expand beyond two planets with a companion (2 + 1) to multi-planets with a companion (N + 1) configuration.

3. ANALYTICAL STABILITY CRITERION
As discussed in Section 2, the distant companion can excite the eccentricities and inclinations of the inner orbits. Meanwhile, GR along with other dynamical processes, such as Laplace-Lagrange and EKL, induces precession of the inner orbits. If the combined precession rate induced by GR and Laplace-Lagrange effect is faster than that of EKL, eccentricity excitations will be suppressed (e.g., Naoz et al. 2013; Denham et al. 2019)3. Therefore, to explore whether a system is stable, we need to inspect and compare all the precession rates among the aforementioned processes (see Section 2).
The inner system undergoes accumulated precession due to GR, Laplace-Lagrange, and any other short-range

3 Note that in some cases the Laplace-Lagrange level of interaction can excite eccentricities between the inner orbits, but GR precession may also suppress these excitations (e.g., Murray & Dermott 2000, Section 7.7, Faridani et al. in prep.)

effects that may affect the system, such as tidal and

magnetic interactions (e.g., Hut 1981; Eggleton et al.

1998; Eggleton & Kiseleva-Eggleton 2001; Fabrycky &

Tremaine 2007; Liu et al. 2015; Ahuir et al. 2021). In

fact, any short-range effect that causes apsidal preces-

sion can suppress the eccentricity excitations brought

by the EKL effect (e.g. Innanen et al. 1997; Liu et al.

2015). For the inner planets to survive, these precession

rates need to be faster than the induced precession from

the EKL, which is responsible for the eccentricity exci-

tations. Therefore, the general stability criterion can be

written as:


 EKL <  LL +  GR,max +  SR, >  LL +  GR,max +  SR,

stable , unstable ,

(17)

where  LL = 1/TLL,  GR,max = 1/TGR,min,  EKL = 1/TEKL, and  SR stands for the precession rate of other short-range forces or effects. Here we examine both the secular and short-range forces or effects on the argument of periapsis. We note that we consider the argument of periapsis precession rate due to the Laplace-Lagrange interaction, LL (as was done in Denham et al. 2019)., even though it is not the resonant angle of the LaplaceLagrange. It is relevant because it is the resonant angle of the EKL quadrupole level of approximation. Notice that while in the previous section we considered the precession timescale, we find that the stability criteria is better characterized in terms of the time derivative of the resonant angle, i.e., the precession rate of the argument of periapsis. Moreover, the precession rates of different stabilizing effects can be added directly because the argument of periapsis, , is one of the canonical variables of the system, the Delaunay's elements (e.g., Valtonen & Karttunen 2006). According to the Hamilton's equations, the time derivative of  can be added because the Hamiltonian of interactions between different objects can be added directly.
Equation (17) generalizes the previous analytical criterion which neglected other short-range effects and is straightforward to extend beyond 2 + 1 configuration to multi-planet systems. We first introduce the numerical methods we use throughout this work in Section 4. In Section 5 we then consider a two-planet system with one far-away companion (2+1), and extend the stability criterion to include GR effects. Furthermore, in Section 6 we show the extension of the criterion to 3 + 1 systems.

4. NUMERICAL METHODS
In the rest of this work, we test our analytical criterion with numerical approaches. We employed a combination of the Gauss's averaging method and direct N-body integration.

The Gauss's averaging method considers the interactions by treating each celestial body as a ring of material whose mass is spread across its orbit, instead of a mass point (Murray & Dermott 2000, Section 7.6). Orbital evolution is then calculated by the interactions between different rings. The robustness of this algorithm was verified in many different studies for non-crossing orbits (e.g., Touma et al. 2009; Touma & Tremaine 2014; Nesvold et al. 2016; Sridhar & Touma 2016; Denham et al. 2019). We included the GR effect up to the first order post-Newtonian expansion to this method (e.g., Tremaine & Dong 2012; Naoz et al. 2013; Will 2017). The Gauss's averaging method provides a relatively fast integration for systems that do not experience closeencounters. Thus, we primarily use this method for slowly-varying stable systems.
Direct N-body integration with GR is significantly slower but more accurate when it comes to closeencounters (see Tamayo et al. 2020). Therefore, all the unstable systems are integrated using this method. We double-checked the accuracy of these two integrators by comparing their simulation results on the same systems and found conformity between them.
As in Denham et al. (2019), we adopted the same proxy log(1 - ) to quantitatively measure the stability of the system, where  is a parameter representing the closest distance between two inner orbits of planet j and k throughout their evolution:

 := min aj(1 - ej) - ak(1 + ek) ,

(18)

aj - ak

assuming j > k. The closer the inner orbits are, the smaller  is. When the two orbits cross, i.e., log(1-)  0, strong gravitational interactions will almost certainly result in unpredictable and violent behaviors. Therefore, systems that undergo orbit crossings are therefore defined as "unstable" systems.
We are aware that there are different proxies which can be used to indicate whether a system is stable or not, such as Lyapunov characteristic exponent and the Mean Exponential Growth of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO, see Cincotta & Sim´o (2000); Go´zdziewski et al. (2001)). However, instead of inspecting the rate of separation of different orbits, focusing only on the separation itself serves its purpose in this work, as we will show in Section 5 and Section 6. Thus, we adopt the more easily calculated and more intuitive proxy  defined in Equation (18).

5. EXAMPLE OF 2+1 SYSTEM
As a proof-of-concept, we consider two sub-Earthsized inner planets and a distant Jupiter-sized companion orbiting around a 1M star. We initialize the two

The semi-major axis of planet 2 and the eccentricity of the companion are chosen as two free parameters that varies within a specific range. In this work, we inspect the stability criterion in the a2 - ec parameter space. The same analysis can be applied to any other choice of free parameters.

When  LL +  GR (red curve) is faster than  EKL (blue curve), the system is predicted stable, and unstable vice versa. Within the transition zone, the system are expected to undergo large eccentricity excitations, but orbit-crossing may happen late in time.

inner planets on nearly circular orbits with low mutual inclinations. Planet 1's semi-major axis is 0.03 au and planet 2's semi-major axis is allowed to vary from 0.05 - 0.3 au. The outer companion is initialized on a 5-au orbit with an inclination of 85 with respect to the inner ones4. The eccentricity of the companion is chosen as another free parameter that ranges from 0 - 0.9. The initial conditions are listed in Table 1. All other orbital elements that are not listed here are initialized to be 0, including the argument of periapsis j, the longitude of ascending node j, and the true anomaly j.

4 The value of the initial mutual inclination has a negligible effect on the stability, as long as it is higher than the Kozai angle (Denham et al. 2019).

In this specific 2 + 1 configuration, we find that within the varying range of the free parameters in Table 1, the corresponding GR precession rates of planet 1 is always much faster compared to EKL's and LL's, which is reasonable as it is the closest planet to the star and the furthest one from the disturbing companion. Consequently, planet 1 is always stable in our configuration. Therefore, we focus on the precession rates of planet 2 from now on.
The precession rate of each effect on planet 2 with the choice of ec = 0.5 as an example is plotted as a function of a2 in Figure 2. As can be seen, the precession rate of GR is generally faster than that of LL in this case. Consequently, the crossing points between  LL +  GR (red curves) and  EKL (blue curve), or the maximum a2 that planet 2 can survive for a long time, is relaxed to higher values compared with non-relativistic predictions.
From the timescale argument presented in Section 2, we can find a stability criterion for the companion's eccentricity as a function of planet's 2 semi-major axis a2 according to Equation (17). The stability criterion can be easily rearranged to account for other unknown variables in the system (for example, companion eccentricity and period) for an observed system (Denham et al. 2019, Faridani et al. in prep.). Equating the two sides in Equation (17) for planet 2 yields a critical eccentricity for the companion:

where  2,stab stands for the summation of all the precession rates of stabilizing effects on planet 2:

(20)

In Equation (19), ec,crit denotes the critical eccentricity of the companion that separates the stable and unstable systems in the ec - a2 parameter space. Note that the limits of the critical eccentricity, ec,crit( 2,LL,min) and ec,crit( 2,LL,max), are obtained by substituting the minimum and maximum  LL ( reciprocal of Equation (12) - (13)) into Equation (19). Our analytical criterion in Equation (17) then becomes


ec < ec,crit(a2,  2,LL,min), > ec,crit(a2,  2,LL,max),

stable , unstable .

The region between the two critical eccentricities is a transition zone from stable to unstable systems, where systems are nearly or completely unstable. It is straightforward to incorporate other short-range physical pro-

They share the following initial orbital parameters in common: M = 1M , m1 = m2 = 10-6M , mc = 10-3M , a1 = 0.03 au, ac = 5 au, e1 = e2 = 0.001, i1 = i2 = 0.001, ic = 85, and 1 = 2 = c = 1 = 2 = c = 0. The only differences are a2 and e3. For the stable system A, a2 = 0.1, ec = 0.5. For relativistic stable system B (only stable when considering GR), a2 = 0.175, ec = 0.6. Finally, for unstable system C, a2 = 0.25, ec = 0.7. We show the time evolution of the aphelion and perihelion of each planet (top row), and the inclination with respect to the initial planet configuration (bottom

cesses in addition to GR by simply adding corresponding terms to  2,stab.
To test the criterion derived above in a numerical approach, we integrate the 2 + 1 systems with planet 2's semi-major axis increasing from 0.05 to 0.3 au in steps of 0.025 au, and the eccentricity of the distant companion ranges from 0 to 0.9 in steps of 0.1. In addition, we add more densely populated integrated systems in the parameter space where it is close to the critical eccentricity ec,crit (see Figure 3 and discussions below). The systems are integrated up to 170 Myrs or until orbit crossing. As mentioned, we use a combination of Gauss's method and N-body integration to check for consistency.
In Figure 3, each scattered point represents a simulated system, and their colors reflect the minimum distance between planet 1 and 2 ( in Equation (18)) for each system throughout its evolution. Stable orbits are represented as darker blue colors, whereas closer or even crossing orbits are plotted in lighter blue. Here we impose a minimum cutoff value of -0.3 on log (1 - ) in color representation. In other words, all stable systems whose log (1 - ) is less than -0.3 are represented as the same deepest blue color, so as to better illustrate the transition from stability to instability. All the systems that experience orbit-crossing are circled out with a black contour. For comparison, the relativistic and non-relativistic analytical stability criteria derived in the presence of GR and in Denham et al. (2019) are over-plotted in red and yellow curves respectively. Relativistic systems are predicted to be stable below the red curves and unstable above them. Shaded regions represent their corresponding transition zones, in which systems are likely to experience large eccentricity oscillations but orbit crossing happens after a long time, possibly exceeding the limit of our integration time. Systems between the yellow and red curves are what relativistic and non-relativistic criterion predicts differently. Compared with the non-relativistic criterion, the relativistic one expands the stable region in the parameter space.
There is a slight discrepancy on the lower-right part of the parameter space due to the limited integration time. We emphasize that the criterion developed here predicts unstable systems if orbit crossing happens at any time during their evolution regardless of timescale. Therefore, the simulated results may not reach instability within the limited numerical integration time. Integrating to Gyrs is challenging in the presence of GR precession. Thus, the simulation results tend to underestimate the unstable region in the parameter space (e.g., Myll¨ari et al. 2018). Nonetheless, the systems that are expected unstable but do not experience orbit crossing all have very close orbital distance  (as close as

10-3 au). As depicted in Figure 3, our analytical criterion seems to qualitatively agree with the numerical results.
To illustrate the effect of the GR precession in stabilizing the system, we select three representative systems from the grid, marked A, B, and C as indicated in Figure 3. They correspond to stable, relativistic stable (unstable by non-relativistic predictions) and unstable systems, respectively. The evolution of the aphelion, perihelion, and inclination are plotted as a function of time in Figure 4.
According to the non-relativistic criterion, system B should be unstable. Indeed, when we integrate system B without adding GR effects, the orbits cross and planet 2 collides with the star after about 1.5 million years, as can be seen from the zoomed-in plot in the top middle panel of Figure 4. However, with the help of general relativity, the excited oscillations in eccentricity and inclination from the distant companion are largely suppressed, rendering stable evolution. The simulation results validates the relativistic analytical criterion proposed in Section 3.
6. EXAMPLE OF 3+1 SYSTEM As another example of the criterion's application, we now inspect the stability of systems with three inner planets and a distant companion, or 3 + 1 systems. The systems are initialized with three close-in sub-Earthsized planets and a Jupiter-sized companion orbiting around a star of M = 1M . Planet 1 and the companion lie on the same orbit as in the 2 + 1 case. The initial conditions of the system are listed in Table 2.

Figure 6. Simulation Results and Stability Criterion for 3 + 1 Systems. We show the stability condition based on Equation (24 that includes GR (red line), compared to numerical simulations. The x-axis represents the third planet's semimajor axis a3 while the y-axis represents the companion eccentricity ec. The color represents how close the orbit of planet 2 and 3 become defined by log(1 - ) (see Equation (18)) over the integration time. Systems are integrated up to a maximum of 90 Myr. The circles with the black contours represent systems that have experienced orbit crossing. Over-plotted are the stability criterion from Denham et al. (2019) without the contribution of GR. In Figure 7 we show the time evolution of three representative systems in different regimes denoted as A, B, and C in this plot.

After applying the generalized stability criterion Equation (17) on each planet, we find that planet 1 and 2 are stable in the varying range of a3 and ec. However, planet 3 is not. The precession rates of different effects on planet 3 with the choice of ec = 0.8 as an example is plotted in Figure 5.
As before, we can divide the parameter space by equating the two sides in Equation (17) for planet 3, which gives a similar critical eccentricity of the companion ec,crit:

The general criterion in Equation (17) then becomes


ec < ec,crit(a3,  3,LL,min), > ec,crit(a3,  3,LL,max),

stable , unstable .

(24)

The only difference from the 2 + 1 case is the subscripts change from 2 to 3. Recall that  3,LL includes the contribution of Laplace-Lagrange effects from all the planets, according to Equation (12) and (13).
Again, we simulate the evolution of systems with different initial conditions in the ec - a3 parameter space as a test of the derived criterion. The simulation results are plotted in Figure 6. The same legend in Figure 3 applies here. Each system is represented as a scattered point, and their colors reflect the closest distance between planet 3 and its nearest neighbor planet 2 throughout the evolution. A minimum cutoff value of -0.5 is imposed on log (1 - ) in color representation to show the transition more clearly. The relativistic and non-relativistic critical eccentricities are plotted in red and yellow curves in Figure 6 respectively. Systems lying below the red curves should be stable, while the ones above them should be unstable.
Most of the systems' behaviors agree with our expectations. It is worth mentioning that the simulation results conform with the criterion better than the 2 + 1 case, mainly because the precession rates of planet 3 are faster due to the presence of a closer neighboring planet

Figure 7. Time Evolution of Representative Systems Time evolution of three representative systems, corresponding to
systems A, B, and C labeled in 6. They share the following initial orbital parameters in common: M = 1M , m1 = m2 = m3 = 10-6M , mc = 10-3M , a1 = 0.03 au, a2 = 0.05 au, ac = 5 au, e1 = e2 = e3 = 0.001, i1 = i2 = i3 = 0.001, ic = 85, and 1 = 2 = 3 = c = 1 = 2 = 3 = c = 0. The only difference lies in a3 and ec. For the stable system A, a3 = 0.16, ec = 0.4. For relativistic stable system B (only stable when considering GR), a3 = 0.2, ec = 0.5. Finally, for unstable system C, a3 = 0.0.24, ec = 0.6. We show the time evolution of the aphelion and perihelion of each planet (top row), and in the inclination with respect to the initial planet configuration (bottom row).

2, as can be seen from Figure 2 and Figure 5. The limitation on integration times are therefore mitigated. An exception at a3 = 0.14 and ec = 0.8 is investigated in the the Appendix A. We expect that this system undergoes a resonant-like behavior where GR precession tends to destabilize the resonant angle, thus causing eccentricity excitations (e.g., Naoz et al. 2013; Hansen & Naoz 2020). Notice that within the relativistic transition zone, only part of the systems experience "true" orbit crossing, while others all have very close orbital distances (as close as 5×10-3 au), suggesting that longer integration timescale may indeed yield instability. This is consistent with the notion that systems in the transition zone will experience large eccentricity excitations and are on the brink of instability, but orbit crossing may happen very late in their evolution, exceeding our simulation capabilities.
Similarly to the 2+1 case, in Figure 7 we plot the time evolution of three representative systems A, B, and C marked in Figure 6, corresponding to stable, relativistic stable, and unstable cases. Relativistic and nonrelativistic criterion disagrees on the behavior of system B, and it is indeed the case according to the top middle panel and the zoomed-in over-plot in Figure 7. Without GR, the eccentricity of planet 3 oscillates largely that the orbits of inner planets cross and finally collide with the star (planet 1) or become ejected out of the system (planet 2) after only about 6 Myr. In comparison, once

GR is taken into account, the same system behaves stable and periodic over timescales of 100 Myr. Again, this is a convincing proof of our analytical criterion.
7. DISCUSSION
Multi-planet systems are a pervasive configuration in our Galaxy (e.g., Tremaine & Dong 2012; Fabrycky et al. 2014; Rowe et al. 2014; Lissauer et al. 2014). Many of them are believed to be compact systems with tight planetary orbits (e.g., Howard et al. 2012; Brewer et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2019; Weiss et al. 2018; Weiss & Petigura 2020). The close distance to the star makes it possible for general relativity to shape their dynamical features. Meanwhile, stellar systems with faraway companions, either planets or stars, are also abundant (e.g., Raghavan et al. 2010; Knutson et al. 2014; Konopacky et al. 2016; Bryan et al. 2016; Zhu & Wu 2018; Bryan et al. 2019). While these two populations are detected using different methods, existing evidence shows that multi-planet systems may be accompanied by faraway companions (e.g., Lai & Pu 2017; Becker et al. 2020).
In this work, we have examined the orbital stability of hierarchical planetary systems with multiple nearly coplanar close-in planets and an inclined, distant, massive companion, i.e., the N + 1 configuration (illustrated in Figure 1). The companion tends to excite the eccentricities of inner planets and possibly drive the system to instability via the EKL mechanism (see Naoz 2016). However, both the Laplace-Lagrange planet-planet in-

Figure 8. From left to right, we systematically add planet 1 at a1 = 0.03 au, planet 2 at a2 = 0.05 au, and both planet 1 and 2 into a system with initial conditions listed in Table 2 and choose a3 = 0.2 au, ec = 0.5. It is clear by comparison of different panels how the existence of planet 1 and 2 can help suppress the EKL eccentricity excitation on planet 3 via Laplace-Lagrange secular interactions. Additionally, in each panel, the eccentricity excitation with GR (solid color lines) is much less than that of without GR (light color lines). In fact, GR helps prevent orbit crossing in an non-relativistic unstable system.

teraction and the short-range interactions, such as relativistic precession induced by the star, can help suppress the EKL eccentricity excitations from the companion.
We have developed a general analytical criterion that predicts the long-time stability of the system based on its initial conditions by comparing the precession rates from the relevant effects (see Equation (17)). Systems with fast EKL precession rates, compared to the aforementioned interactions, can be driven to instability. Conversely, the Laplace-Lagrange planet-planet interactions and short-range forces or effects, such as relativistic precession, can stabilize the system against eccentricity excitations if their precession rates are faster than that of EKL's. Similar to Denham et al. (2019), we have identified a transition zone in the parameter space between stable and unstable systems. Within the transition zone, the inner planets' eccentricities are excited to large values but they do not necessarily always undergo orbit crossing.
Aside from the general relativity we consider here, other possible short-range interactions, such as tidal forces (e.g., Hut 1981; Eggleton et al. 1998; Eggleton & Kiseleva-Eggleton 2001; Fabrycky & Tremaine 2007; Liu et al. 2015) and magnetic interactions (e.g., Ahuir et al. 2021) between the planets and the star can also contribute to the stabilization of such systems. We demonstrate that any extra short-range forces or effects in addition to GR, which we consider in this work, can be accounted for by incorporating corresponding precession rates in the SR term in the general criterion in Equation (17).
Two different configurations are inspected in this work. First, we apply the criterion on a set of 2 + 1 systems with different initial conditions where GR plays a non-negligible role, extending the criterion developed in Denham et al. (2019) by including GR effects. This extension of the stability zone is depicted in Figure 3,

where we plot the non-relativist and relativistic criteria in yellow and red curves respectively. To validate our theory, a series of different systems in the ec - a2 parameter space are integrated numerically using a combination of N-body integration and Gauss's averaging method. Our simulation results conform qualitatively with our analytical predictions, though there is a slight difference due to our limited integration time. Time evolution of three example systems in Figure 4 also proves our theory. Specifically, the eccentricity excitation in the presence of GR is found to be significantly suppressed compared to the non-relativistic case (see case B in Figure 4). This effect contributes to the stabilization of observed two-body exoplanet systems from possibly unveiled companions (see Faridani et al. in prep.).
As a further generalization, the analytical criterion is then applied to a set of 3+1 systems as another example. Simulations using the same numerical techniques show consistency between analytical criterion and numerically integrated results in the ec - a3 parameter space (see Figure 6). Time evolution of three example systems are presented in Figure 7 and authenticates the prediction of the analytical criterion again. Notice that only part of the systems in the transition zone undergo orbit crossing, while others experience close orbit encounters. This confirms the notion that systems in the transition zone are on the brink of instability.
To illustrate the stabilizing effects of the LaplaceLagrange and GR interactions comprehensively, here we present another set of time evolution results of one of the 3 + 1 systems initialized in Table 2, with the choice of a2 = 0.05 au and e3 = 0.5. As shown in Figure 8, we systematically add one or more planets into the system and inspect their influence on the eccentricity excitation of planet 3. Specifically, from left to right, we begin with the configuration including the star, planet 3, and the companion. Then in the second panel, we add planet 1

only, followed by adding planet 2 only in the third panel. Lastly, in the fourth panel, we consider the full 3+1 system. The lines in solid colors represent the evolution in the presence of relativistic precession, while the lines in light colors represent the non-relativistic case. As shown Figure 8, each time one or more planets are added into the system, the eccentricity oscillation is suppressed. The closer the added planet is, or for a higher multiple of planets, the larger the suppression of the eccentricities is. This trend is a direct reflection of the stabilizing effect of the Laplace-Lagrange interaction. Additionally, in each panel, the eccentricity excitation of the relativistic case (solid lines) is always much smaller than the non-relativistic case (lighter line), highlighting the effi-

ciency of GR precession in suppressing the eccentricity excitations induced by the EKL effect from the companion. A combined effect of Laplace-Lagrange interactions and short-range forces or effects such as general relativity contributes to stabilizing observed systems against a faraway companion.

Figure 9. Illustration of a resonant system in Figure 6 at a3 = 0.14, ec = 0.8. We remove the companion, planet 2, and planet 1 in the first three columns respectively to identify the reason for the resonant behavior of the 3 + 1 system.

Figure 6 shows a system that exists deep within the stable region but undergoes orbit crossing at a2 = 0.14 au and ec = 0.8. As one can tell from Figure 6, its neighboring systems with either smaller or larger semi-major axis of planet 2 are mostly stable. Together with its time evolution which we are about to show in Figure 9, we are convinced that this anomaly stems from a resonant-like behavior. In this Appendix, we show that this orbital crossing is a result of GR destabilizing the system. It was shown that GR precession can destabilize the resonant family, especially when the GR precession rate is similar to that of EKL, and sometimes even when the GR precession is shorter (e.g., Ford et al. 2000; Naoz et al. 2013; Hansen & Naoz 2020). According to Figure 5, the precession rate of EKL, GR, and Laplace-Lagrange are all comparable for planet 3 at a2 = 0.14 au and ec = 0.8, thus yielding a resonant-like behavior, as is suggested in the three-body case (Naoz et al. 2013).
In Figure 9, we consider this configuration in both non-relativistic and relativistic perspectives (top and bottom rows, respectively) and systematically remove one different member from the system each time. Specifically, from left

to right in Figure 9, we remove the companion, planet 2, planet 1, and present the full 3 + 1 system respectively. One may wonder if the orbit crossing is a result of a Laplace-Lagrange resonance. However, as depicted in the first column of Figure 9, this system is stable in the absence of a faraway companion, both with and without GR precession, excluding the possibility of Laplace-Lagrange resonance among the inner planets. Analytical calculations of maximum eccentricities due to Laplace-Lagrange interactions alone also excludes this explanation. We then add either planet 1 (second column) or planet 2 (third column) to show that the GR precession, in fact, stabilizes the system in the 2 + 1 case. Finally, under the full 3 + 1 configuration, the resonant behavior only appears when GR is added, confirming the explanation that it is GR that brings about the resonance.
