Primordial black holes from a cosmic phase transition: The collapse of Fermi-balls
Kiyoharu Kawana1,  and Ke-Pan Xie1,  1Center for Theoretical Physics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea
We propose a novel primordial black hole (PBH) formation mechanism based on a first-order phase transition (FOPT). If a fermion species gains a huge mass in the true vacuum, the corresponding particles get trapped in the false vacuum as they do not have sufficient energy to penetrate the bubble wall. After the FOPT, the fermions are compressed into the false vacuum remnants to form non-topological solitons called Fermi-balls, and then collapse to PBHs due to the long-range Yukawa attractive force. We derive the PBH mass and abundance, showing that for a O(GeV) FOPT the PBHs could be  1017 g and explain all of dark matter. If the FOPT happens at higher scale, PBHs are typically overproduced and extra dilution mechanism is necessary to satisfy current constraints.

Introduction.­ Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes which form prior to any galaxies and stars [1, 2]. Although not yet confirmed by experiments, PBHs have been a source of interest, as they can serve as a good candidate for dark matter (DM) [2­8], can seed supermassive black holes [9­13], can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe [14­ 24], and can explain some gravitational wave (GW) signals at LIGO/Virgo [25­30], etc. While the most popular PBH formation mechanism is the collapse of the overdense region from primordial perturbations of inflation [31­33], there are other scenarios such as the collapse of cosmic topological defects [34­40], scalar field fragmentation [41­44], etc. PBHs can also form during a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in the early Universe via bubble collisions [45­53].
In this letter, we propose a novel PBH formation mechanism based on the collapse of non-topological solitons produced during a cosmic FOPT. The simplest realization of this mechanism consists of a real scalar  and a Dirac fermion , with the Lagrangian

which conserves the fermion number by a global U (1)Q. The scalar potential U () triggers a FOPT from  = 0 to w at temperature T. If gw T, the fermions cannot penetrate into the new (true) vacuum bubbles, where they acquire a mass M  gw that significantly exceeds their thermal kinetic energy. Consequently, after the FOPT, fermions are trapped in the old (false) vacuum and compressed to form non-topological solitons called Fermi-balls [54] if there is an asymmetry between the number densities of  and ¯, such that only 's survive the ¯   annihilation. The conditions for Fermi-ball formation can be easily satisfied in many new physics models [54]: gw T can be realized by a supercooled FOPT [55­61] or strong coupling [62, 63] while the  asymmetry can be generated by various asymmetric DM mechanisms [64­66].
Fermi-balls are macroscopic compact objects that collect huge Q-charge originating from the fermion asymmetry. Inside the Fermi-ball is the false vacuum

 = 0, in which 's are massless fermions interacting with each other via the attractive Yukawa potential

whose range of force M-1 is determined by the effective mass at the false vacuum

where U (, T ) is the thermal potential, c is the thermal

coefficient contributed by the light degrees of freedom

(DOF) in a model. Normally, M-1

the size

of a Fermi-ball, so that the 's can be treated as

independent particles, and the Fermi-Dirac distribution

applies. However, provided that µ2 < 0, when the

Universe cools down to T  -µ2/c,  becomes massless inside the Fermi-ball and hence mediates a long-

range attractive force among the 's, resulting in the

collapse of Fermi-balls into PBHs.

In short, the FOPT forms Fermi-balls, which in turn

collapse into PBHs when the internal Yukawa force

becomes long-range.1 PBH formation via the attractive

scalar force has been also studied in Refs. [68, 69] where

an ultralight scalar is introduced to provide a long-range

force, causing the growth of density perturbation in the

plasma. In our work,  needs not to be light: As long as

µ2 < 0, the effective mass M can reach zero at T, and collapse happens only in individual Fermi-balls. Thus,

the only extra condition required by the PBH formation

is µ2 < 0 in Eq. (3) once Fermi-balls form. Since this

situation can be easily realized in many particle physics

models, we conclude that our scenario is rather generic.

The mechanism is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1, and

the details are discussed below.

Fermi-ball formation in FOPT.­ At critical

temperature Tc, the two vacua are degenerate, and the

Universe still stays in the false vacuum  = 0, see

1 The collapse of Fermi-balls via gravity is recently studied in [67].

FIG. 1. Sketch of the mechanism. (a) Tc:  (red points) and ¯ (green points) live in the false vacuum (white). (b) Tn: true vacuum bubbles (blue) nucleate. Fermions cannot penetrate into the bubbles due to the large mass gap. (c) Tp: Fermions are trapped in the false vacuum remnants. (d,e) T: remnants shrink to form Fermi-balls. (f ) T: Fermi-balls collapse into PBHs.

Fig. 1a. Below Tc, the Universe acquires a probability of decaying to the true vacuum  = w(T ) that has a lower
energy, and the decay rate is dominated by the O(3)-
symmetric bounce action S3(T ) of the thermal potential U (, T ) [70];

(T )  T 4e-S3(T )/T .

Bubbles start to nucleate at Tn when (Tn)H-4(Tn)  1 (see Fig. 1b), where the Hubble constant is H(T )2 = (8/3MP2l) (R(T ) + U0(T )). Here R(T ) = 2gT 4/30 is the radiation energy density, g is the number of relativistic DOF, U0(T ) = U (0, T ) - U (w(T ), T ) is the positive free energy difference between the true and false vacua, and MPl = 1.22 × 1019 GeV.
Given (T ) and H(T ), we can define the the volume
fraction of the false vacuum to the Universe as p(T ) = e-I(T ) where I(T ) is the amount of true vacuum volume
per unit comoving volume [71­73]. The percolation
temperature Tp is defined by p(Tp) = 0.71 [74] at which the bubbles form an infinite connected cluster,
see Fig. 1c. The Fermi-balls form at T defined by p(T) = 0.29 [54] at which the false vacuum is separated into disconnected remnants, which first split and then
shrink to Fermi-balls. The critical remnant is defined as
a remnant that just ends splitting and starts to shrink,
and its radius R is determined by [54]

(T)V

V

(5)

where vb is the bubble wall velocity. Eq. (5) means that the critical remnant shrinks to a Fermi-ball before
another true vacuum bubble is created inside it. The
number density of the critical remnants is given by nrem. = V-1p(T) and it is also the number density of Fermi-balls right after the formation, nFB = nrem..
Fermions are trapped in the false vacuum and the trapping fraction Ftrap. is a function of vb and M/T = gw/T [54, 75], where w = w(T). For example, M = 12 T and vb = 0.6 yield Ftrap.  0.98. When the remnants shrink, the fermions are forced to annihilate
via ¯  . The  bosons are free to pass through
the wall to the true vacuum, and finally annihilate/decay

to the Standard Model (SM) particles via the Higgs portal coupling 2|H|2. Describing the  asymmetry by   (n - n¯)/s(T ) with s(T ) = 22gT 3/45 being the entropy density, the number of  fermions surviving the
annihilation in a critical remnant is

where s = s(T). A remnant stops shrinking when the trapped fermions' degeneracy pressure is able to balance the vacuum pressure U0(T). Once such balance is built, the remnant together with its trapped fermions form a Fermi-ball, see Fig. 1d and e.
Let us now evaluate the profile of a Fermi-ball. Minimizing the Fermi-ball energy

Note that the first term in Eq. (7) only considers the degeneracy pressure of the Fermi gas and we neglect the subdominant contribution from thermal excitations. See supplemental materials for a more accurate Fermi-ball profile. As we will see, RFB is typically much larger than the Schwarzschild radius of a Fermi-ball, thus gravity can be neglected in the calculation. Recently, it is proposed that during a FOPT the trapped fermions might be compressed to be a PBH without forming any stable soliton in Ref. [53]. Numerical simulations show that such a scenario requires a very large mass gap M/T 200 and small Yukawa g 10-3 [53]. Since we consider M/T  O(10) and g  O(1) in this letter, Fermiballs can safely form during the FOPT in our scenario.

2 The FOPT-induced Fermi-ball is first proposed in Ref. [54]. There are various DM mechanisms based on trapping particles into the false vacuum: quark nuggets [76­83], accidentally asymmetric DM [84], FOPT-induced Q-balls [85, 86], etc.

Collapse of Fermi-balls into PBHs.­ After for-
mation, the Fermi-ball cools down by emitting light particles, e.g.   f f¯ where f could be electrons or neutrinos [76] (via the 2|H|2 or other portal couplings).
As shown in the supplemental materials, the cooling time
scale of the Fermi-ball is much shorter than the Universe
expansion. Therefore, the Fermi-ball is able to track the
temperature of the plasma, so that its profile changes
slowly by replacing T  T in Eq. (8), and the number density is diluted as nFB = nFBs(T )/s. Assume µ2 < 0 in Eq. (3), the correlation length M-1 = (µ2 + c T 2)-1/2 of the Yukawa force inside the Fermi-ball increases as the Universe cools down. When T reaches T  -µ2/c, M-1 = , and the potential energy of the Yukawa force starts to be effective:

EFB

= - g2 Q2FB 20 R

.

(9)

This term dominates the Fermi gas kinetic term in Eq. (7) since QFB 1, and its negative sign causes instability forcing Fermi-balls to collapse into PBHs. See Fig. 1f for illustration. The PBH mass is then given by MPBH = MFB|TT , and the number density right after formation is nPBH = nFBs(T)/s.
Up to now, our PBH scenario has been completely described. Given the thermal potential U (, T ), one can derive T by calculating (T ) and H(T ). The Fermi-ball profile is determined by (T) and U0(T), while the PBH profile is derived by running the Fermi-ball profile to T. Below we give some general estimates for the PBH profile based on a few simplified assumptions.
The PBH profile.­ We consider the radiation dominated era and approximate T  Tp since the Fermiball formation is very close to the percolation. In this case, the bounce action can be obtained as [87]

S3(T)  131 - 4 ln

T

T

100 GeV

- 4 ln

/H 100

+ 3 ln vb - 2 ln

g 100

, (10)

where /H is the time scale ratio of the Universe expansion and the FOPT. Next, we assume U0(T)  × R(T), where  is the ratio of the latent heat of FOPT to the radiation energy density. The parameters  and /H are also crucial in the calculation of GWs [88­91] from a FOPT. For simplicity, we omit the temperature dependence of the Ferm-ball mass.
We are now able to express the Fermi-ball and PBH profiles as functions of (vb, , T, , /H). Let Ftrap.  1, the charge and radius of a Fermi-ball are given by

Therefore our scenario prefers PBHs with sublunar

which confirms that gravity is negligible in the Fermi-ball formation.
PBHs with mass between 109 g and 1017 g evaporate between the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and today, leaving impacts on the BBN, Cosmic Microwave Background and extragalactic and Galactic -ray backgrounds, which in turn put stringent constraints on the PBH abundance. Such constraints are usually shown as upper limits for PBH as a function of PBH mass, where PBH is related to the energy fraction of PBH to the Universe at formation time [6­8]. For our scenario,

For MPBH 109 g, the upper limit of PBH varies from 10-29 to 10-17 [6­8]. For example, for vb = 0.6, g = 100, T = 100 GeV, and /H = 100, current bounds require MPBH < 1010 g, which corresponds to  < 1.8 × 10-14 if  = 1.
PBHs with mass lager than 5.1 × 1014 g can survive
until today. Such PBHs can be probed/constrained by Hawking radiation (if MPBH 1017 g), gravitational lensing, dynamical processes, cosmic structure, etc [6­
8, 92]. The abundance is usually described by the fraction
of PBH to DM, i.e. fPBH = PBH/DM 1. While there are already stringent constraints for fPBH, there is still a mass window 1017 g  1021 g that PBHs can account for

implying that non-evaporating PBHs can become a DM candidate when the formation temperature T is significantly lower than 100 GeV. For example, for vb = 0.6, g = 10, T = 1.1 GeV,  = 1, /H = 100 and  = 0.9 × 10-10, one obtains MPBH = 4.2 × 1017 g and fPBH = 1, allowing a PBH DM candidate. Note that even in the mass region that PBHs cannot be the dominant DM component, they can still play an important role in the Universe evolution, such as seeding supermassive black holes or large scale structure formation.
We emphasize that above discussions on PBH and fPBH apply only to an adiabatically expanding Universe. If there is some process happening between the formation of PBHs and the BBN that enhances the entropy of the Universe by a factor of , then the abundance is diluted as PBH  PBH/ and fPBH  fPBH/, and the constraints would be weakened. As there are various mechanisms generating significant entropy, such as thermal inflation [93­95], early matter era [96­99], late-time decay of domain walls [100­102], etc, we can say that our PBH DM scenario is possible in many particle physics models.
Summary.­ We have discussed a novel PBH formation mechanism based on the collapse of Fermi-balls from a FOPT and illustrated that it can explain all of DM if T 100 GeV. When T 100 GeV, our scenario typically predicts the overproduction of PBHs, and suitable dilution mechanism is needed to satisfy the experimental constraints. Since such a dilution is ubiquitous in new physics models, our scenario can be applicable in various models of particle physics.
Throughout the letter, we have assumed that a fermion  has a vanishing bare mass and that the FOPT occurs by the transition of  from  = 0 to w for simplicity. Thus,  is massless and massive in the false and true vacua, respectively. However, even if the fermion has a bare mass M0 and the FOPT is generally from  = w1 to w2, our mechanism still applies as long as M|true = |M0 + gw2| M|false + T = |M0 + gw1| + T. In this case, the Fermi-ball/PBH profile needs to be modified, but the qualitative picture remains the same.

Cooling of Fermi-balls.­ When Fermi-balls are shrinking, the old vacuum remnant is in equilibrium via the fast ¯   process. After the Fermi-ball formation, pair annihilation stops since only 's are left inside Fermi-balls. Instead, the  system cools down by emitting light fermions such as electrons or neutrinos [76]. Following the method in Ref. [83], according to StefanBoltzmann's law, the energy escaping from a Fermi-ball per unit time is

The Fermi-ball profile.­ Given the charge QFB, the energy of a Fermi-ball with radius R at temperature T is

where the first term is the Fermi gas kinetic energy derived from the low-temperature expansion of the Fermi integral, the second term is surface tension which is negligible since the Fermi-ball has a macroscopic size, and the third term is the bulk potential energy. By solving dEFB/dR|RFB = 0 one obtains the Fermi-ball profile

For a strong FOPT, U01/4(T ) T , the numbers in above brackets are very close to 1, leading to the expressions
in Eq. (8) in the main text. The stable conditions for a
Fermi-ball against decay and fission are respectively

< 0;

While the second condition is automatically satisfied
if the surface term ( Q2F/B3) is considered, the first condition needs to be checked for a specific model.

where the Nf is the number of DOF of light fermions, e.g.

6 for 3 generations of neutrinos. We then can establish

the cooling equation for a Fermi-ball as

dMFB = -L(T ) ,

(21)

dt

where MFB is the Fermi-ball mass given in Eq. (18). Eq. (21) can be solved analytically if we neglect the slow
temperature dependence of U0(T ). Defining the cooling time scale FB as the time duration of a Fermi-ball cooling from T to T /2, we find

which means that cooling is slower than the collapse.
Thus the Fermi-ball almost stays at T during it is collapsing to a PBH, guaranteeing MPBH = MFB|TT as we have already used before.
