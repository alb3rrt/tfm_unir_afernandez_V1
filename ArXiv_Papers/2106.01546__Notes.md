## Abstract

\lambda v(x)+H( x, Dv(x) )=0 , \quad x\in \mathbb{R}^n. \end{equation} We reduce the problem for equation \eqref{eq:discount 1} into that for a time-dependent evolutionary Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We proved that the singularities of the viscosity solution of \eqref{eq:discount 1} propagate along locally Lipschitz singular characteristics which can extend to $+\infty$. We also obtained the homotopy equivalence between the singular set and the complement of associated the Aubry set with respect to the viscosity solution of equation \eqref{eq:discount 1}.
