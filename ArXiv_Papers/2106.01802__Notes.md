## Abstract

A pair of complex-conjugate fixed points that lie close to the real axis generates a large mass hierarchy in the real renormalization group flow that passes in between them. We show that pairs of complex fixed points that are close to the real axis and to one another generate multiple hierarchies, some of which can be parametrically enhanced. We illustrate this effect at weak coupling with field-theory examples, and at strong coupling using holography. We also construct complex flows between complex fixed points, including flows that violate the $c$-theorem.
