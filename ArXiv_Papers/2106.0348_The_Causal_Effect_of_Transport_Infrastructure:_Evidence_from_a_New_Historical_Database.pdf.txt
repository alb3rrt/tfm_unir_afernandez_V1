The Causal Effect of Transport Infrastructure: Evidence from a New Historical Database
This version: May 28, 2021
Erik Lindgren,Per Pettersson-Lidbom, and Björn Tyrefors
Abstract In this paper, we analyze the effect of transport infrastructure investments in railways on three measures of local economic activity: real nonagricultural income, agricultural land values and population size. As a testing ground, we use data from a new historical database that includes annual panel data on approximately 2,400 Swedish geographical units, i.e., local governments, during the period 1860-1917. We use a staggered event study design that is robust to treatment effect heterogeneity. Importantly, we find extremely large reduced-form effects of having access to railways. For real nonagricultural income, the cumulative treatment effect is approximately 120% after 30 years. Therefore, this effect is 20 times larger than most reducedform effects found in previous works on the effect of transport infrastructure on economic activity. Equally important, we also show that our reduced-form effect reflects growth rather than a reorganization of existing economic activity.

1. Introduction
Transportation infrastructure is often considered a key to promoting growth and development (e.g., Banerjee et al. (2020)). Indeed, Rostow (1960, p. 302) argues that "the introduction of the railroad has been historically the most powerful single initiator of take-offs". However, it has been difficult to substantiate this claim. Indeed, Fogel (1964) found little evidence for the historical importance of railways to economic growth. Additionally, recent quasi-experimental work on the direct effects of railroads on income and industrialization has reached a similar conclusion since most of the estimated direct effects of transport infrastructure are small, i.e., approximately 6% (see Section 6.2.1 in Redding and Turner (2015)).1
Nonetheless, this conclusion is perhaps premature since it is very challenging to estimate the causal effects of railways on economic activity, as discussed by Donaldson (2015), among others. Indeed, Donaldson argued that a successful empirical analysis must overcome problems of non-comparability between treatment and control regions and that the regions do not interact (i.e., that SUTVA is fulfilled). There is also additional econometric problem that must be solved, which is that traditional two-way fixed effect (TWFE) regression models, i.e., linear regression with period and group fixed effects, are not reliable when the treatment effect is heterogeneous across groups or time (e.g., Borusyak et al. (2021), Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020), de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020, 2021), Godman and Bacon (2021), Sun and Abraham (2020)). This issue is a real problem for studies of the effect of transport infrastructure on economic activity since: (i) many of them have used TWFE regression models, as discussed by Redding and Turner (2015) and Redding (2020); and (ii) "transport improvements are likely to have heterogeneous treatment effects" (Redding (2020, p. 27). Thus, the results from many of these studies might be severely biased. 2
In this paper, we solve all of these problems by estimating the causal effects of railways on economic activity. Specifically, we collected highly spatially disaggregated data on an annual basis for the universe of approximately 2,400 administrative geographical units (i.e., local governments) in Sweden for the period of 1860-1917. Having such a highly spatially disaggregated panel data set with yearly observations makes it possible to implement an
1 There are a number of recent studies that estimates the direct effect of railways on economic activity, for example, Atack and Margo (2011), Banerjee et al. (2020), Berger and Enflo (2017), Berger (2019), Andersson et al (2020), and Donaldson (2018). 2 Importantly, in our Appendix, we show that the results from some prominent recent historical studies of the effect of railways on economic activity, i.e., Donaldson (2018), Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016), Heblich et al. (2020), and Hornung (2015), have been unreliable.

unusually credible and statistically powerful event study design with a staggered treatment adoption,3 i.e., an event study design based on a maximum of 1,340 openings of new railways. Indeed, we employ the new event study estimator developed by de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020, 2021) to circumvent the problem with the TWFE regression model when treatment effects are heterogeneous.4
Most importantly, having access to panel data with a very large number of annual observations also makes it possible to convincingly rule out any violation of the pretrends in development outcomes long before the arrival of railroad access to the local government. Indeed, we cannot reject that the parallel trends assumption holds for at least 25 years before the opening of railways for any of the outcomes we analyze.
An equally attractive feature of our panel data set is that we have highly spatially disaggregated data on arguably the most important measures of local economic activity since we have yearly data on population size, agricultural land values, and real income in the nonagricultural sector. Thus, it is possible to analyze the potential effect of transport infrastructure on the local economy with much more precision and in much greater detail than in any previous study.
In contrast to the previous empirical literature on the effect of railways on economic activity, we find extremely large direct effects of transport infrastructure on local economic activity. Indeed, real income in the nonagricultural sector is increased by approximately 120% over a 30-year period after the opening of a railway. Thus, this effect is approximately 20 times larger than that in many previous studies (see Section 6.2.1 in Redding and Turner (2015)). We also find that railways have an impact on agricultural land values and population size, which both increase by approximately 15% over a 30-year period after the opening of a railway.
Another key contribution of our study is that we empirically distinguish growth from reorganization using an idea suggested by Redding and Turner (2015, Section 4.3), i.e., "with panel data, one could estimate the change in the treated region following a change in transportation costs and also the change in the untreated region following the change in the treated region". Importantly, finding that untreated regions are affected by a change in the treated region casts doubt on the reliability of the direct approach of estimating the effect of
3 Importantly, a staggered difference-in-difference design does not rely on the assumption that the treatment, i.e., transport infrastructure, is randomly assigned; rather, it relies on the weaker assumption of parallel trends in the absence of the treatment. 4 Importantly, our results do not rely on using the de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020, 2021) estimator. Indeed, we find almost exactly the same results if we use any of the robust event study estimators developed by Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020) or Borusyak et al. (2021).

transport infrastructure since the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) will be
violated.5 Reassuringly, we find little evidence of SUTVA violations when estimating the
placebo effects of our staggered treatment design where adjacent neighboring regions without
access to railways act as placebo treatment groups following a change in railway access in the
treated regions. Indeed, the estimated placebo effects are rather precisely estimated zeros.
Finding little evidence of either positive or negative spillover effects also suggests that our
reduced-form effects reflect growth rather than a reorganization of existing economic activity,
as discussed by Redding and Turner (2015).
This paper adds to the literature on the effect of transport infrastructure investments in
general and on railways in particular.6 Specifically, this study is the first to use a credible event
study design that solves the problem with heterogeneous treatment effects.7 Moreover, the
highly spatially disaggregated historical data from Sweden are also considerably better and
more comprehensive than the data in any previous study since we have annual data on both a
very large number of railway openings, i.e., a maximum of 1,340, and the key measures of
local economic activity, i.e., real income, land values, and population size. Additionally, to the
best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to be able to credibly distinguish growth from
reorganization based on the observed effects of infrastructure.8
5 If SUTVA-violating spillovers between regions are negative, then the true treatment effect will be overstated. Similarly, if the spillovers are positive, then standard estimators will understate the true effect (Donaldson 2015). 6 See Redding and Turner (2015) and Redding (2020) on infrastructure investments in general. On investments in railways, see Donaldson (2018), Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016), Heblich et al. (2020), and Hornung (2015). There are also three recent Swedish studies of the effect of railways. Berger and Enflo (2017) investigated whether urban development, i.e., population size, differs depending on having access to a state-owned railway using data from 81 small urban areas, i.e., towns. The second study by Berger (2019) analyzed the long-run local effect of having access to a state-owned railway line on population size and employment types using data from only two years: 1850 and 1900. The third study by Andersson et al. (2020) analyzed the effect of railways on innovative activity. Importantly, these studies did not analyze all of the available railway openings. Indeed, Enflo and Berger only analyzed the openings of 22 state-owned railways, while Berger used 168 openings of state-owned railways. In sharp contrast, we use all available openings, including all private railways, since it is otherwise impossible to solve the problem with heterogenous treatment effects. Moreover, the Swedish studies did not use annual data or analyze the effect of railways on real income or land values. 7 To the best of our knowledge, Heblich et al. (2020) and Hornung (2015) are the only studies using an event study design. However, Heblich et al. (2020) used a conventional event study design, in which theyd impose unnecessary restrictions on the dynamics, i.e., binned endpoints, and their approach is unreliable if the treatment effect is heterogeneous across units or time. Moreover, their event study is not based on annul data but only on decennial data. Similarly, Hornung (2015) used a conventional event study design with unnecessary restrictions on the dynamic event study specification. His event study was also based on triennial data. All other studies of the effects of railways on economic outcomes used a "static" TWFE approach, i.e., Anderson et al. (2020), Atack and Margo (2011), Berger (2019), Berger and Enflo (2017, Donaldson (2018), and Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016). Importantly, in Lindgren et al. (2020), we find that the results from many of these studies are not robust to heterogeneity in the treatment effect. 8 On this point, Redding and Turner (2015) note that "The existing reduced form literature generally does not provide a basis for separately identifying the two effects".

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the construction and financing of the Swedish railway network. Section 3 presents the data. Section 4 discusses the empirical design: an event study with a staggered treatment adoption. Section 5 presents the results, while Section 6 describes our test to distinguish growth from reorganization. Finally, Section 7 discusses and concludes.
2. The Swedish railway network
Sweden started to build railways in 1856, which for Europe was very late (e.g., Hedin 1967). Remarkably, however, Sweden had one of the largest railway networks worldwide in 1914. For example, there were 25 kilometers of railroads for every 10,000 inhabitants, a figure more than twice that of any European country. Only four countries (the US, Canada, Australia, and Argentina) had larger networks in per capita terms (Hedin 1967).
Another interesting feature of the Swedish railway network is that 75% of railways were built, financed and operated by private interests, while the remaining 25% were built by the state (Ottosson and Anderssson Skog 2013). Figure 1 shows how the length of state and local railways developed from 1856 to 1917. This dual feature of the Swedish railway network stems from a decision made by the Swedish Parliament in 1854 that the railway network should be constructed and financed only partly by the state. 9 Indeed, the state should only be responsible for the trunk lines, while all local branches should be built, financed and operated by private local interests. As a result, Sweden had a dual system of railway network ownership, planning and control, whereas many other countries had only one of these two systems: private (e.g., the US and Great Britain) or state (e.g., France and Prussia) railway networks. As a result, the Sweden railway network was to a large extent both unstructured and uncoordinated due to the large influence of local private interests (Ottosson and Anderssson Skog (2013, p. 16), Nicander (1980, p. 8)). Indeed, after the first decision in 1854, there was an ongoing debate in Parliament over the relative merits of having privately owned or state-owned railway networks, as discussed by Oredsson (1969). Thus, this conflict of interest resulted in Sweden having a curious mixture of state and private railway lines until 1939, when the total railway network was nationalized.10

With regard to the building of private local railways, the following procedure was required.11 First, a group of initiators, i.e., the local private interests, conducted an investigation led by an experienced railway technician. The technician then drafted a plan for the construction of the local railway together with an estimate of its costs. Second, the local private interests applied for a railway license from the central government, where the investigation by the technician provided the necessary documentation. The application was then reviewed by the Road and Water Construction Board ("Väg och Vattenbyggnadsstyrelsen"), which was a government agency overseeing investments in transport infrastructure. Third, if the application was granted, then the group of initiators formed a limited liability company that would be in charge of the construction and operation of the local railway. Importantly, as discussed by Ottoson and Andersson Skog (2013, p. 15), the state had little influence on these private companies once the application had been granted. In fact, the state always approved the application if 2/3 of the required capital had been procured (e.g., Andersson-Skog, (1993, p. 38.) Fourth, before the construction of the local railway could start, the limited liability company was required to have acquired all the necessary funding.
The financing of the state-owned trunk lines was predominately carried out via foreign loans that were procured by the National Debt Office. At the beginning of the 20th century, the national debt due to these investments in state railways constituted nearly 90% of GDP.
11 This description is based on Nicander (1980).

However, the financing of private local railways was almost exclusively raised within the country using several different sources, i.e., issuing stocks (40%) and taking out bond loans (30%), central government loans (20%), and promissory note loans and other short-term loans (10%). Notably, state aid constituted only 20% of all private local railway capital.
Additionally, local governments were often of decisive importance for the construction of local railways since they were usually large stockholders. Indeed, they were often the largest stockholder (e.g., Oredsson (1989) and Hedin (1969)). Swedish local governments could invest in local railways because of the Local Government Act of 1862 since it explicitly gave local governments permission to deal with all economic matters of local importance, including local infrastructure investments; previously, local governments had been in charge of primary education, poor relief and matters related to the clergy. All local government spending was to be financed via a proportional income tax rate that local governments could set completely freely.12 At the beginning of the 20th century, the average income tax rate was nearly 10% but could be as high as 40%. Local government investments in local railways were predominately financed via long-term loans, typically with a 40-year maturity, which required approval from the central government. During the period 1870-1908, more than 700 local governments had taken out such loans.
The local financing of railways was highly controversial during this period. The reason was that the decisions to finance local railways were made at regular municipal town meetings where only a few voters could have the majority of votes due to the weighted voting system where voters received votes in proportion to their taxable income, as discussed in our previous research, i.e., Lindgren et al. (2019, 2020). Mellquist (1974, p 139-155) analyzes in close detail how the railway investment decisions were made in 128 distinct cases. He finds that in almost all of his investigated cases, local private interests, typically in the form of a few industrialists, could determine the outcome of the decisions to financially support local railways at these municipal town meetings since they usually possessed many more votes than all other meeting attendants combined. Moreover, Mellquist finds that most landowning farmers voted against the financing of local railways. Thus, this finding clearly illustrates the existence of a historical social conflict between landowners and industrialists regarding the attitude toward industrialization and the institutional organization of the labor market in the Swedish setting. For example, having access to local railways would make it more difficult for landowners to
12 The state grants constituted less than 10% of local government revenues.

control their labor force. Another and perhaps the most important reason for landowners' opposition to railways is that they were afraid of losing their political power.13 Indeed, if industrialists had more to gain from local railways than landowners, then the Swedish weighted voting system based on taxable income implied that the landowners would also receive fewer votes in the future than the industrialists. We also obtain this finding, as discussed further below.
Turning to a description of the distribution of railway openings in local governments over time, i.e., the source of variation on which our event study design is based, we present Figure 2, which shows the years of opening of state railways across all local governments during the period 1856-1917. There were a total of 267 such openings, and most of them occurred around 1860 when the main trunk lines were built. However, during the same period, there were a total of 1,073 private railway openings, and there were relatively few openings before 1870. Thus, out of the 1,340 openings of new Swedish railways up to 1917, 80% of them were private railways.
As a result of this preponderance of private investments in railways, local railways transported many more people and goods than state-owned railways. For example, in 1910, 38 million people traveled on local lines, but only 20 million traveled on trunk lines. The tonnage of goods transported by local railways was also 2 times higher than that transported by stateowned railways.

3. Data
We collected highly disaggregated data on an annual basis for approximately 2,400 local governments for the period 1860-1917.14 In this paper, we analyze three outcomes: population size, real nonagricultural income and agricultural land values.
We digitized yearly data on the population sizes of the municipalities at the end of the year. These data were originally collected by Statistics Sweden and come from two sources: for the period 1860-1874, they come from unpublished material from the Swedish National Archives ("summariska folkmängdsredogörelserna"). For the period 1874-1917, the population data are from the publication "Kommunernas fattigvård och finanser 1874-1917" (BiSOS U).
We also digitized data on nonagricultural income for the period 1880-1917 from the publication "Kommunernas fattigvård och finanser 1874-1917" (BiSOS U). Here, nonagricultural income included both labor income and all other types of capital income, including corporate income. Most importantly, the rules governing the Swedish income tax system were identical across all local governments since they were based on the exact same rules: the Central Government Tax Act implemented in 1862 (SFS 1861:34 Bewillningsförordning 1862). As a result, with our data, we can avoid problems in comparing real income both across jurisdictions and across time.
Additionally, we digitized data on the assessed value of agricultural land for the period 1880-1917 from the publication "Kommunernas fattigvård och finanser 1874-1917" (BiSOS U). The Central Government Tax Act also governed real estate taxation. Specifically, the taxation of agricultural land was based on the assessed property value, which generally reflected the true value market value, as discussed by Lindgren (2017). Indeed, an investigation by Flodström (1912) found that the assessed agricultural property value was approximately 90% of the sales value. Importantly, these assessments occurred on a regular basis, usually every third year. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of these three outcomes.

4. Empirical design
Our empirical research design is a DID design with a staggered treatment adoption. Therefore, the population regression model can be written as follows:

(1)

Yit=i+ t + itRailit + vit,

where i denotes a region, i.e., the geographical area of a local government, and t is time. i is a region fixed effect, and t is a year fixed effect. Yit is a measure of real nonagricultural income, agricultural land values, or population size. All the three outcomes will be expressed in logarithmic form since this convention is used in in the literature on transport infrastructure (e.g., equation 33 in Redding (2020)). Railit is an indicator variable that takes the value of 1 if region i has access to a railway in year t. The population model allows for heterogeneous treatment effects by region and time and, thus, by the number of years since treatment. The model also incorporates the parallel trends assumption, whereby the expected outcome absent the treatment is i+ t. Importantly, the parallel trends assumption is much weaker than assuming that the treatment, i.e., railways, is randomly assigned. In fact, railways are rarely built randomly; thus, the parallel trends assumption seems much more sensible in regard to investments in transport infrastructure.
Therefore, it is important to test whether the parallel trends assumption is satisfied. However, estimating equation (1) as a traditional event study, i.e., through ordinary least squares (OLS) with two-way fixed effects and some lags and leads of treatment, produces estimates that are unreliable in the presence of heterogeneity in the treatment effects, as discussed above. Thus, we use an event study estimator developed by de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020, 2021), which is robust to heterogeneous or dynamic treatment effects. Their estimand identifies the treatment effect on the switchers at the time they switch. In staggered designs, the instantaneous treatment effect is equal to the average of simple DID estimands and compares groups treated for the first time at t and not yet treated at t, from t-1
10

to t. Similarly, the various estimands of the dynamic treatment effects of switchers are also defined as the weighted average of simple DID estimands. For example, the average cumulative treatment effect of switchers after one period, i.e., in period t+1, compares the evolution of the outcome from t - 1 to t + 1, between groups that are treated at period t and groups that are still untreated at period t + 1. The estimands of the placebo treatment effects used for testing the plausibility of the parallel trends assumption are also defined correspondingly, as discussed by de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2021). Specifically, de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2021) argue that "the long-difference placebos may lead to a more powerful test of common trends" since "the long-difference placebos test if common trends holds over several periods". In our analysis, we estimate these treatment and placebo effects using the did_multiplegt Stata command developed by de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020, 2021).
Turning to the number of switchers that identify the various dynamic and placebo treatment effects, we present Figures 4 and 5, which show the number of switchers, i.e., the number of municipalities with railway openings, that identify the treatment and placebo effects in our data. Importantly, we estimate dynamic effects up to 30 years after the first switch and estimate placebo effects up to 25 years before the first switch since we have a very long panel data set. We start with the population data, which cover the period 1860-1917. Figure 4 reveals that the instantaneous treatment effect is based on 1,188 switchers, while the dynamic effect after 30 years is based on 654 switchers. Similarly, the first placebo effect is based on 1,183 switchers, while the long-difference placebos after 25 years are based on 586 switchers.
For the two other outcomes, real income and agricultural land values, we have fewer switchers since these data cover only the shorter time period 1880-1917. Figure 5 shows the number of switchers depending on the event time. The instantaneous treatment effect is estimated using 678 switchers, while the dynamic effect after 30 years is based on 145 switchers. The first placebo effect is based on 658 switchers, while the long-difference placebo after 25 years is based on 164 switchers.

Another important specification issue concerns how we define the date at which the treatment occurs. One possibility is the year when the railway is opened for use. However, since infrastructure projects usually take a long time to complete, local economic activity can be affected even long before the opening of a railway. To investigate this issue, we collected data on the building time of all local railways, finding that 94% of such railways had a building time of at most 2 years. Thus, it seems reasonable to expect that the treatment effect might occur 2 years prior to opening.
5. Results
In this section, we present the results from our DID design with staggered treatment adoption. We use the estimators developed by de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020, 2021), which are robust to heterogeneous or dynamic treatment effects.
Starting with the effect of railways on the logarithm of real nonagricultural income, we present Figures 6 and 7, which show event study graphs of the relationship between the opening of a railway and the evolution of the outcome. In Figure 6, the treatment is based on the opening year, whereas in Figure 7, it is defined two years prior to opening. These two graphs show that the treatment and control groups have remarkably similar trends 25 years before the opening of a railway. However, it seems that the treatment effect already occurs two years prior to the treatment since many of the placebo effect estimates in Figure 6 but not in Figure 7 are significantly different from zero. Indeed, when we estimate the first-difference placebos proposed by de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2020), these placebos are all zero except for the first two placebos, which again suggests that the correct way of defining when the treatment effect occurs is when railways begin to be built. In other words, the no-anticipation assumption is violated during the time when a railway is being constructed. Turning to the estimates of the dynamic treatment effects, we find that the dynamic effects start to continuously grow directly after the treatment occurs. Thus, after 30 years, the cumulative treatment effect has increased as much as 123% (=exp(0.80)-1) relative to the control group. In other words, this finding indicates that the average yearly growth in real income was 2.7%.
Turning to the effect of railways on logarithmic agricultural land values, we present Figure 8, which displays the event study plot for land values. Again, the parallel trends assumption seems to hold for 25 years prior to the opening of a railway since all the placebo effects are close to zero and are not significantly different from zero. Interestingly, there is no anticipation effect of agricultural land values, which is most likely because the assessment of land values occurs only every third year, as noted above. The cumulative treatment effect is
13

also much smaller for land values than real nonagricultural income since it has increased by only 16% (=exp(0.148)-1) 30 years after the opening of a railway relative to the control group. Thus, the effect of railways on land values is considerably smaller, by a factor of 7, than the effect on real income in the nonagrarian sectors of the local economy. Therefore, this result underscores that land values miss substantial economic gains, as discussed by Hornbeck and Rotemberg (2019).
Turning to the effect of railways on logarithmic population size, we present Figures 9 and 10, which display the event study plot for population size. These two graphs show that the treatment and control groups have remarkably similar trends 25 years before the opening of a railway. However, similar to the analysis of real nonagricultural income, it seems that the treatment effect already occurs two years prior to the treatment since many of the placebo effect estimates in Figure 9 but not in Figure 10 are significantly different from zero.15 Nonetheless, the cumulative treatment effect is of the same magnitude as that for land value since the population has increased by only 17% (=exp(0.153)-1) 30 years after the opening of a railway relative to the control group.
15 Interestingly, some of the estimates of the leads are still significantly different from zero even in Figure 10 despite that there are very close to zero. However, our sample is very big and therefore trivial differences in pretrends will lead to rejection of parallel trends.

6. Distinguishing growth from reorganization
In this section, we analyze whether railways changed the amount of economic activity or reorganized existing economic activity. As discussed by Redding and Turner (2015), "Determining the extent to which the observed effects of infrastructure reflect changes in the level of economic activity versus a reorganization of existing activity is fundamental to understanding the effects of infrastructure and to policy analysis".
To empirically separate growth from reorganization, we use a strategy proposed by Redding and Turner (2015) since they suggest that "with panel data, one could estimate the change in the treated region following a change in transportation costs and also the change in the untreated region following the change in the treated region".
Indeed, we estimate whether there are any positive or negative spillover effects from treated to untreated regions since we use panel data. To implement our empirical test, we first restricted the sample to never-treated units, i.e., those local governments that never had access to a railway during the sample period. We then matched these never-treated units to their closest geographical neighbors with access to a railway sometime during the sample period. It is now
17

possible to implement exactly the same type of DID specification as that in equation (1) but with the treatment indicator redefined, i.e.,

(2)

Yit=i+ t + itRail_neigborsjt + vit,

where i denotes a geographical area that never obtained access to a railway during the sample period. Rail_neigborsjt is now an indicator function that takes the value of 1 if a neighboring area j has access to a railway at time t.
As a result, the it parameter captures the spillover effects of the treatment on areas without railways. Therefore, a statistical test of jt=0 is a test of whether the railway changed the amount of economic activity or reorganized existing economic activity. It also tests whether there is a SUTVA violation.16 Specifically, finding that jt0 will cast doubt on our staggered DID design in equation (1) since the control group is also affected by the treatment.
We start by showing the number of switchers on which the estimation of the placebo event study is based since we must exclude all treated regions that cannot be matched with an untreated region, i.e., a neighboring region without a railway. Figure 11 displays the number of switchers when using real nonagricultural income and agricultural land values as the dependent variables. There is a dramatic reduction in the number of switchers in the placebo test compared to the previous event study design displayed in Figure 5. For example, the maximum number of switchers drops from 678 to 279, which is a reduction of 60%. Thus, we can implement the placebo event study design only for a shorter event window: only 15 years before and 20 years after the event. There is also a similar reduction in the number of switchers when population size is the dependent variable.
Figures 12-14 present the event study results from equation (2). To facilitate comparison with our previous event study results shown in Figures 6-10, we used the same scaling on the y-axes. We also used the year of railway opening to define the date at which the treatment occurred. All three figures reveal that there are no spillover effects of the treatment since all the placebo estimates and all the dynamic effects are close to zero and are not significantly different from zero. Thus, these results suggest that our reduced-form effects in Section 5 reflect growth rather than a reorganization of existing economic activity, as discussed by Redding and Turner (2015).

16 The market access approach was developed by Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016) to take these spillover effects into account.
18

As a result, the lack of spillover effects from local railways in the Swedish setting suggests that local markets are not well integrated. One potential reason for this finding is that the local governments were such sufficiently large spatial units that transport and trade mostly took place between the villages within municipalities. Indeed, the average distances that people and goods were transported on these local railways were only approximately 18 km and 38 km, respectively, suggesting that the effect on the local economy was very localized. Another potential reason is that Sweden had a very labor-repressive agricultural system that severely restricted the movements of labor in rural areas, as discussed by Lindgren et al. (2019).

7. Conclusion
In this paper, we analyzed the effect of transport infrastructure investments in railways on three measures of local economic activity: real nonagricultural income, agricultural land values and population size. As a testing ground, we used data from a new historical database that includes annual panel data on approximately 2,400 regions (i.e., local governments during the period 1860-1917). We used a staggered event study design that is robust to treatment effect heterogeneity, i.e., de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020, 2021). Importantly, we find extremely large reduced-form effects of having access to railways. For real nonagricultural income, the cumulative treatment effect is approximately 120% after 30 years. Therefore, this effect is 20 times larger than most of the reduced-form effects found in previous work on the effect of transport infrastructure on economic activity (Redding and Turner 2015). Equally important, we also show that our reduced-form effect reflects growth rather than a reorganization of existing economic activity.
Our result that real nonagricultural income was so greatly affected by having access to railways not only speaks to the literature on the effect of transport infrastructure investments on economic activity but also is related to the literature on the effect of political institutions on economic development more generally. Specifically, in our previous work, Lindgren el al. (2019, 2020), we argued that changes in local political institutions played a key role in the Swedish growth miracle, i.e., Sweden's transformation from one of the poorest countries in Europe in the mid-19th century to one of the richest countries worldwide in the 1960s. Indeed, we argue that the introduction of the new weighted voting system at the local level in 1862, which gave industrialists considerable political power to influence the decisions made at municipal town meetings, such as decisions on building local railways, was a fundamental determinant of economic growth, as discussed by Acemoglu et al. (2005). In this paper, we provide actual compelling evidence that local railways were one of the engines of growth.

Appendix
In this appendix, we empirically illustrate the problem of using a standard two-way fixed effect (TWFE) estimator to estimate the effects of railways on economic activity when the treatment effect is likely to be heterogenous. We also compare the results from the TWFE approach with an estimator that is robust to treatment heterogeneity. The illustration is based on four recent and prominent studies with highly accessible data: Donaldson (2018), Heblich et al. (2020), Hornung (2015), and Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016). Moreover, we also test whether the TWFE estimator produces biased results in our study.
There are at least three problems with a TWFE estimator when treatment effects are heterogenous according to Borusyak et al. (2021), i.e., underidentification of the fully dynamic regression, negative weights in both the static and dynamic regressions, and spurious identification of the long-term effects. As will become clear below, all four of the studies had at least one of these problems. As a result, we show that the estimates from their TWFE specifications are not reliable.
Starting with Donaldson (2018), he used yearly data from 235 districts in India over the period of 1870-1930.17 He used a static TWFE specification, i.e.,

(1)

Yit=i + t + Xit +it,

where i denotes a unit, and t denotes time. Yit is the log of real income in the agricultural sector, and Xit is a binary variable taking the value of 1 if the district has access to a railway in period t.
He reported a point estimate of  as 0.164 with cluster robust standard error of 0.049. Thus, according to his TWFE estimate, access to a railway increases real income in the agricultural sector by 18% (=exp(0.164)-1). However, the static TWFE specification places severe restrictions on the dynamic effects of the treatment, leading to bias unless they are true. To avoid this type of bias, we can allow for an unrestricted (saturated) dynamic specification by re-specifying equation (1) as an event study, i.e., a TWFE dynamic event study regression, as follows:

where  is an event-study indicator variable that takes the value of one if a unit i is k periods away from initial treatment at time t and zero otherwise. Figure 1A shows the results from the event study with an unrestricted dynamic specification, where the first lead is excluded for normalization.18 Importantly, there is no problem with underidentification in the unrestricted dynamic specification due to the existence of never-treated units in Donaldson's data.
For clarity, we only present the estimates for the 10 years before and after the treatment occurs. The results from the event study design show that we cannot reject that the parallel trend assumption holds, but also that we cannot reject that there is no effect of the treatment. Thus, the dynamic TWFE specification yields very different results from the static TWFE specification used by Donaldson.

To further investigate whether the dynamic TWFE specification is reliable,19 we also estimate the event study design using the de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2020, 2021) estimator, which is robust to heterogenous treatment effects. This result is presented in Figure 2A and reveals a similar result to the fully dynamic TWFE specification.
18 This figure is produced using the eventdd command developed by Clarke and Schythe (2020). We used this command to produce other fully dynamic event study specifications in this Appendix. 19 Sun and Abraham (2021) showed that the unrestricted dynamic TWFE specification could be unreliable if the treatment effect was heterogenous.

Time relative to the treatment Turning to the study by Heblich et al. (2020), they analyzed the effects of railways/subways on log population size using parish-level data from London on a decadal basis over the period of 1801-1901.20 The number of parishes in their data is 283, and 128 of them obtained access to a railway/subway during this period. Heblich et al. used a dynamic TWFE specification but placed restrictions on the fully dynamic specification; i.e., they binned their endpoints. However, there is no reason to restrict the dynamic specification because of the existence of a large group of never-treated units, i.e., 155, in their data. They also included unit-specific linear time trends in their dynamic TWFE specification. Figure 3A shows the estimates from their specification. It reveals that the parallel trend assumption is likely to hold and that the effect of having access to railways is approximately 10%. The long-term cumulative dynamic effect after 60 years is also substantial, i.e., approximately 320% (=exp(1.43) -1). However, since they restricted their dynamic TWFE
20 Another issue with their event study is that their data were not annual but only decadal. Thus, this difference means that their event study design relied on observations that were not necessarily close to the event date, i.e., the year of opening of a new subway line. Moreover, there would also be a mismatch between when the actual event took place and when it was recorded. For example, if the event occurred in 1882, it was recorded in the data as having taking place in 1891.

specification, it might have introduced bias. Figure 4A shows the results from their dynamic TWFE specification without any restrictions on the dynamic event study specification. Figure 4A shows completely different results from the event study in Figure 3A. Indeed, the parallel trend assumption is violated, and there is no evidence of any dynamic treatment effects. Thus, the TWFE approach yields very different results depending on the dynamic specification. Figure 3A. Results from a restricted event study specification: Heblich et al. (2020)

To further probe whether the unrestricted dynamic TWFE specification is reliable, we again estimate the event study design using the de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2020, 2021) estimator, which is robust to heterogenous treatment effects. This result is presented in Figure 5A. This figure also shows that the parallel trend assumption does not hold. Indeed, there is a strong pretrend before the treatment occurs, casting doubt on the appropriateness of using an event study design in this case.

Time relative to treatment Turning to the study by Hornung (2015), he estimated the effects of railways on log population size using city-level data from the historical German state of Prussia for the period of 1837-1861. His data are not based on annual observations but instead triennial on data from 978 Prussian cities. Horning also used an event study design with restrictions on the dynamic TWFE specification.21 Again, there is no reason to place restrictions on the dynamic specification because of the existence of a large group of never-treated units, i.e., 767, in his data. Figure 6A shows the results from his restricted dynamic TWFE specification, demonstrating that the units have parallel trends before the treatment and that the impact effect is approximately 5%. The long-term cumulative treatment effect is approximately 17% (=exp(0.16)-1). However, a restricted dynamic TWFE specification might introduce bias. Figure 7A shows the results from the fully dynamic TWFE specification. Figure 7A reveals that there is a significant pretrend. Thus, once again the TWFE approach yields different results depending on the dynamic specification.
21 Hornung also defined his leads wrongly in his analysis since he used data after 1861 to define his pretreatment indicator variables, preaccess 2-5. For example, a district receiving access to railways in 1880 would be part of the leads (i.e., preaccess 4 and 5). The correct definition shows that there are significant pretrends using exactly the same dynamic specification as Hornung.

To further probe whether the unrestricted dynamic TWFE specification is reliable, we again estimate the event study design using the de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2020, 2021) estimator, which is robust to heterogenous treatment effects. This result is presented in Figure 8A. This figure also shows that the parallel trend assumption does not hold. Indeed, there is a strong pretrend before the treatment occurs, again casting doubt on the appropriateness of using an event study design in this case.

Time relative to treatment
Turning to the study by Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016), this study is different from the previous ones since they estimated a TWFE specification with a continuous variable, i.e., market access, using data from only two time periods, i.e., 1870 and 1890.22
However, it is still productive to use their data to test whether a standard TWFE with a binary variable is affected by treatment heterogeneity even if there are only two time periods. In fact, Donaldson and Hornbeck reported such a specification in their NBER working paper.
22 When the treatment variable is continuous, then the treatment effect must be proportional to the observed treatment intensity, as discussed by Schmidheiny and Siegloch (2020). Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016) showed results in their Figure IV suggesting this linearity assumption is fulfilled. However, their analysis was not correct since their residualization approach was inconsistent for the target function of interest, as discussed by Cattaneo et al. (2019). Using the correct residualization approach suggests that the assumption of linearity can be violated.
33

Specifically, column 3 of table 2 in their working paper reports that county land value increases by 0.290 log points or 34% when a county receives any railroad track, and they argued that "these estimates may reflect a causal impact of railroads on county land values".23 We can now test whether their TWFE estimator is biased due to dynamic treatment effects by excluding the always treated, i.e., those districts that had a railway in both 1870 and 1890, from the control group, i.e., those districts that did not have a railway in 1870 and 1890. In this case, the point estimate is -0.06 with a standard error of 0.05. Thus, omitting the already treated districts suggests that there is no effect of railways on the outcome. Moreover, the standard errors are so small so that one can reject that the two estimates, 0.29 vs. -0.06, are equal. Thus, the TWFE estimator again produces very different results when treatment effects heterogeneity is considered.
In summary, we have analyzed a number of studies, i.e., Donaldson (2018), Heblich et al (2020), Hornung (2015), and Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016), all of which attempted to estimate the causal effects of railways on economic activity using TWFE estimators. We find that the results are sensitive to the dynamic specification of the treatment effect, i.e., restricted versus unrestricted. When we use the unrestricted specification, we often find strong evidence that the parallel trend assumption is violated. When we estimate the effect using an estimator that is robust to treatment effects heterogeneity, we also find similar results of significant pretrends. These results therefore cast doubt on whether these studies have estimated a causal effect of the effects of railways on economic activity.
It might also be interesting to determine whether our results would be different if we used an TWFE estimator. We therefore present estimates from an unrestricted dynamic TWFE specifications. To facilitate comparison, we also show the figures from the estimator by de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2020, 2021) that we used in our paper.
Starting with effects of railways on real income in the non-agricultural sector, Figure 9A shows the results for fully dynamic TWFE specification, while Figure 10A shows the corresponding results from the de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille estimator. The results are highly similar. This finding strongly suggests that there is very limited treatment effects heterogeneity in our setting.
Continuing with effect of railways on agricultural land values, Figure 11A shows the results for the fully dynamic TWFE specification, while Figure 12A shows the results from the

de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille estimator. Again, the results are similar except for that some of the estimates on the longer leads are now marginally significantly different from zero.
Moving on to the effect of railways on population size, Figure 13A shows the results for the fully dynamic TWFE specification, while Figure 14A shows the results from the de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille estimator. While the estimates of the dynamic effects are similar, the dynamic TWFE estimator now suggests that there is a significant pretrend.24
In summary, in our setting, there seem to be small differences in the results between a fully dynamic TWFE estimator and an estimator robust to treatment heterogeneity. It might therefore be interesting to speculate why this finding occurs. There are a number of potential factors that are different in our setting compared to the other studies: (i) the units of observations are very homogenous, which limits the problem of heterogeneity; (ii) we have annual data, which allow us to accurately capture the dynamic treatment response; (iii) we have a very large group of never treated units, which avoids the problem of underidentification; (iv) we have a very large number of uniform events, i.e., openings of primarily local railways, and the events are distributed fairly evenly across time, which helps to mitigate problems with treatment heterogeneity across units and time; and (v) there are no spillover effects, which excludes violations of SUTVA.
24 This result could be due to our having much more data for population size, i.e., 1860-1917, than for the other two outcomes, for which we only have data for the shorter period of 1880-1917. Thus, there will probably be more heterogeneity in the larger sample, leading to bias in the dynamic event study design, as discussed by Sun and Abraham (2020).
