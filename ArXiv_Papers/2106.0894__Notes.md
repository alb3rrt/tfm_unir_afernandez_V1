## Abstract

(2020), in which configurations of the molecules around a vacancy in solid CO2 with the Pa3 structure (phase I) were calculated by the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation technique at T < 200 K and at a nominal pressure of P = 1 atm using lattice constants determined in reference to experimental data. For the intermolecular potential, the Kihara model of a rod-shape core with zero diameter was used. For theoretical consistency, however, the lattice constant should be determined by a pressure-constant MC simulation, i.e. by the NPT simulation. It was anticipated that the NPT simulation, successful for monoatomic molecular fluids, might not work straightforwardly for solid CO2 because of the non-spherical molecular shape and interactions. In fact, it was found in the present work that the protocol of the standard NPT simulation had to be modified for solid CO2 to achieve an equilibrium lattice constant, given an external pressure, within practical computer time and capacity. The modified protocol was used to calculate the P-V relation at 1 bar and from 2 to 10 GPa at which a structural phase transition is known to take place. The temperature was fixed at 200 K. As a result, the calculated P-V relation was similar to those in previous theoretical works, the molar volume being roughly 0.5 % smaller than experimental data.
