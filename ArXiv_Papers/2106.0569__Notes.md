## Abstract

As progressive densification of cells, deployment of Cloud-RAN and \ac{MEC} are coming into reality to support the ultra-low latency with high reliability in 5G and beyond, it generates mesh traffic pattern across fronthaul network. This led to evolution of PON architectural enhancements with virtualization in order to support such mesh traffic pattern. However, allocation of virtual PON slices dynamically over such mesh-PON based fronthaul transport is becoming a research challenge. In this paper, we provide a mixed analytical-iterative model to compute optimal virtual PON slice allocation, providing mesh access connectivity with ultra-low end-to-end latency in next-generation MEC-based Cloud-RAN. Our proposed method can compute optimal virtual PON slice allocation in timescales compatible with real-time or near real-time operations.
