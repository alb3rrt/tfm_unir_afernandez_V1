The transport coefficients for dilute granular gases of inelastic and rough hard disks or spheres with constant coefficients of normal () and tangential () restitution are obtained in a unified framework as functions of the number of translational (dt) and rotational (dr) degrees of freedom. The derivation is carried out by means of the Chapman­Enskog method with a Sonine-like approximation in which, in contrast to previous approaches, the reference distribution function for angular velocities does not need to be specified. The well-known case of purely smooth d-dimensional particles is recovered by setting dt = d and formally taking the limit dr  0. In addition, previous results [G. M. Kremer, A. Santos, and V. Garzo´, Phys. Rev. E 90, 022205 (2014)] for hard spheres are reobtained by taking dt = dr = 3, while novel results for hard-disk gases are derived with the choice dt = 2, dr = 1. The singular quasismooth limit (  -1) and the conservative Pidduck's gas ( =  = 1) are also obtained and discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
A granular gas is essentially a system of particles that move erratically and collide inelastically. The simplest model to describe its kinetic behavior consists in a collection of inelastic hard spheres with a constant coefficient of normal restitution  (with 0    1) [1­5]. A plausible improvement of the model is the addition of collisional friction due to surface roughness (as demanded by recent experiments [6]), which can be quantified via a constant coefficient of tangential restitution  (with -1    1) [7]. In analogy with a conventional fluid, a hydrodynamic description is also applicable and useful in the case of granular gases [5, 8­24].
If the gas is made of perfectly elastic ( = 1) and either perfectly smooth ( = -1) or perfectly rough ( = 1) hard spheres [25], kinetic energy (including the rotational contribution in the rough-particle case) is conserved upon collisions. Therefore, a complete set of hydrodynamic variables is defined from the densities of the conserved quantities, that is, particle density n (reflecting mass conservation), flow velocity u (due to momentum conservation), and temperature T (associated with energy conservation). However, for inelastic ( = 1) and/or imperfectly rough (|| = 1) hard particles, energy is no longer preserved at the collisional level. Despite that, temperature is usually included as a hydrodynamic variable [5], except that a sink term (the so-called cooling rate) needs to be included in the energy balance equation. Therefore, as done in Refs. [26, 27] for (three-dimensional) hard spheres, in this paper we will choose {n, u, T } as hydrodynamic variables. In contrast, the mean angular velocity  is not a collisional invariant, even if  =  = 1,

and thus it is not included as a hydrodynamic field in our description.
To the best of our knowledge, the derivation by means of the Chapman­Enskog method of the Navier­Stokes­ Fourier (NSF) hydrodynamic description (for generic constant coefficients of restitution  and ) of a twodimensional granular gas of inelastic and rough hard disks (HD) has not been carried out yet. The aim of this work is to fill this gap in an inclusive way by generalizing the study to a hard-particle system with dt and dr translational and rotational degrees of freedom, respectively, in analogy with our previous study on the energy production rates in granular mixtures [28, 29]. In this way, apart from obtaining the sought results for HD gases with the choice (dt, dr) = (2, 1), the results for rough hard spheres (HS) [26] are recovered by setting (dt, dr) = (3, 3). Additionally, the expressions for d-dimensional smooth particles ( = -1) [30] are also reobtained by formally taking dr  0.
Whereas the three-dimensional is perhaps the most general, verisimilar, and intuitive geometry, a twodimensional constrained system is likely found in ordinary life, like a set of marbles moving and spinning on a plane or the pucks and strikers in the air hockey game. But the most important asset of the two-dimensional geometry resides in its ordinary use in experiments setups [31­38]. Thus, this work aims at providing testable results for the hydrodynamic transport coefficients within a general framework that encompasses the three- and twodimensional geometries of spinning particles.
The intricacy of the (dt, dr)-generalization resides in the difficulties associated with a uniform characterization of the HS and HD vector spaces. The HS case is described by a three-dimensional Euclidean space common to both translational and angular velocities. However, to preserve the two-dimensional confinement of the HD system, angular velocities are orthogonal to the translational ones. In order to unify both descriptions in a common

2

framework, we will consider the three-dimensional Euclidean space as an embedding space for the translational and angular velocity subspaces. Those subspaces coincide with the embedding space for HS systems, whereas they form an orthogonal decomposition of the vector space in the HD case. Within such a description, all vector operations and relations can be written as in the HS system [28, 29]. Although this mathematical description seems to be straightforward, it is rather tricky in some aspects, as will be seen.
The present paper is structured as follows. In Sec. II, the Boltzmann equation framework is established and the balance equations of the dt + 2 hydrodynamic fields, {n, u, T }, are derived in terms of dt and dr. This mathematical description allows us to introduce in Sec. III the Chapman­Enskog method around the homogeneous cooling state (HCS), from which we obtain the velocity distribution function (VDF) to first order in the hydrodynamic gradients, f (1), under the form of four linear integral equations. In order to solve those equations, two successive approximations are worked out in Sec. IV. First, a Sonine-like approximation is assumed without prejudicing the form of the zeroth-order HCS VDF f (0); this allows us to express the NSF transport coefficients in terms of velocity cumulants and collision integrals of f (0). As a second step, the unknown function f (0) is approximated by a Maxwellian distribution for the translational velocities times a generic marginal distribution for the angular velocities, what allows us to derive explicit expressions for the transport coefficients (see Table I below). The results are illustrated in Sec. V for both spheres and disks, including some interesting limiting situations. Finally, concluding remarks and main results are summed up in Sec. VI.
II. GRANULAR GAS OF INELASTIC AND ROUGH HARD PARTICLES

We will carry out a kinetic-theory description of a dilute granular gas, in the sense that the one-body VDF will be enough to characterize the system. This approach is complemented with the assumption of molecular chaos or Stosszahlansatz. The analytical treatment is then based on the Boltzmann equation in the absence of external forces, which reads

tf + v · f = J[f, f ],

(2.1)

where f = f (r, ; t) is the VDF at time t and J is the Boltzmann bilinear collision operator:

J1 [f, f ] =dt-1 d2 d (v12 · )
+

×

f1f2 2 | |2dr /dt

- f1f2

.

(2.2)

Here, v12  v1 - v2 is the relative translational velocity,  = (r2 - r1)/|r2 - r1| is the intercenter unit vector at contact, the subscript + in the integral over  des-
ignates the constraint  · v12 > 0, and f1,2 = f (1,2) and f1,2 = f (1,2), the double primes denoting precollisional quantities giving rise to unprimed quantities as postcollisional values. Moreover, use has been made of
the Jacobian (A7).

B. Hydrodynamic Balance Equations

From a macroscopic point of view, the flow of a lowdensity granular gas can be fully described by the knowledge of the following hydrodynamic fields: particle number density n(r, t), hydrodynamic flow velocity u(r, t), and total granular temperature T (r, t). They are given by

n(r, t) = d f (r, ; t),

(2.3a)

A. Boltzmann equation

We consider a HD or HS granular gas made of identi-

cal particles of diameter , mass m, and moment of in-

ertia I = m2/4. The reduced moment of inertia takes

the

The

translational

and

angular

velocities

of a particle will be denoted by v and , respectively.

Whenever convenient, we will use the short-hand nota-

tions   {v, } and d  dv d for simplicity.

Particle-particle collisions are characterized by con-

stant coefficients of normal () and tangential () resti-

tution (see Appendix A for a summary of the collision

rules). As said in Sec. I, vector relations within our gener-

alized description belongs to an embedding space, namely

the three-dimensional Euclidean space E. Therefore, the

collision rules in Appendix A are presented in the three-

dimensional framework.

Note that the rotational temperature Tr is not defined with respect to the mean angular velocity  =  because the latter is not a conserved quantity [26].

3

Given a quantity (r, ; t), its associated transfer equation can be obtained by multiplying both sides of the Boltzmann equation (2.1) by  and integrating over translational and angular velocities. The result is
t(n  ) +  · (n v ) - n (t + v · ) = J [|f, f ], (2.6)
where J [|f, f ] is the collisional production term of the quantity , given by

C. Homogeneous Cooling State

Before analyzing inhomogeneous states in terms of the transport coefficients at the NSF order in Secs. III­V, let us consider the HCS, henceforth represented by the superscript (0). In that case (  0), Eqs. (2.8a) and (2.8b) yield n = const and u = const, while  = 0 [26] and Eqs. (2.8c)­(2.8e) become

Tt(0) + Tt(0)t(0) = 0,

(2.10a)

Tr(0) + Tr(0)r(0) = 0,

(2.10b)

T + T (0) = 0.

(2.10c)

Note that we have not attached a superscript (0) to the global temperature T because of its status as a hydrodynamic variable. The Boltzmann equation (2.1) in the HCS reduces to

tf (0)(; t) = J[f (0), f (0)].

(2.11)

Since in the HCS all the time-dependence of f (0) occurs through a dependence on T , we can write [5, 26]

tf (0)

=

T f (0) T

=

(2.12)

The rotational-to-translational, translational-to-total,

and rotational-to-total temperature ratios are defined as

Tt(0) T

=

Tr(0) T

.

(2.13b)

Those temperature ratios are stationary in the HCS, so

that Eqs. (2.10) imply that t(0) = r(0) = (0). The exact solution to Eq. (2.11) is not known, but good

estimates for the production rates t(0), r(0), and (0) can be obtained by assuming the simple trial function

f (0)()  nvt-hdt t-hdr -dt/2e-c2 r (w),

(2.14)

where

are the scaled translational and angular velocities. Note that, while a Maxwellian translational distribution has been assumed, the (isotropic) marginal rotational distribution r(w) does not need to be specified. Within this approximation, the results are [28, 29]

(3.1b)

where  is a bookkeeping parameter. Thus, the Boltzmann equation (2.1) decouples into a hierarchy of equations of orders k = 0, 1, 2, . . .. The zeroth- and first-order equations are

Dt(0)f (0) = J[f (0), f (0)],

(3.2a)

Dt(0) + L f (1) = - Dt(1) + V ·  f (0).

(3.2b)

In Eq. (3.2b), the linear collision operator L is defined as

L(1) = -J1 [, f (0)] - J1 [f (0), ].

(3.3)

Comparison between Eqs. (2.11) and (3.2a) shows that the zeroth-order VDF f (0) is not but the local version of
the HCS VDF. This will be further confirmed below.
Substituting Eq. (3.1a) into Eqs. (2.9), one obtains

III. CHAPMAN­ENSKOG METHOD
The main goal of this paper is to obtain the NSF constitutive equations with explicit expressions for the associated transport coefficients. As usual, this will be done by assuming that the VDF depends on space and time only through the slow hydrodynamic fields introduced before (n, u, and T ) and applying the Chapman­Enskog expansion method [4, 5].
A. General scheme
The Chapman­Enskog method consists essentially in introducing multi-scale space-time derivatives and a perturbation expansion of the VDF in powers of the gradients of the hydrodynamic fields, namely
  , f = f (0) + f (1) + 2f (2) + · · · , (3.1a)

(3.6)

Note that, within the approximation (2.14),  and (0)
are given by Eqs. (2.20) and (2.17c), respectively. Furthermore, the action of the operator Dt(k) on a
generic function (n, u, T ) of the hydrodynamic fields is

(3.7)

where Dt(k)n, Dt(k)u, and Dt(k)T are obtained from the balance equations (2.8a), (2.8b), and (2.8e). In particular,

Dt(0)n = 0, Dt(0)u = 0, Dt(0)T = -T (0), (3.8a)

(3.8c)

Equation (3.8a) implies that Dt(0)f (0) = -(0)T T f (0), in agreement with (2.12). This confirms again that f (0) is the local version of the HCS VDF.

B. First-order distribution

By following the same steps as in Sec. IVB of Ref. [26], it is possible to express the solution to Eq. (3.2b) as

f (1) =A ·  ln T + B ·  ln n + Cijjui + E · u, (3.9)

where the functions A, B, Cij, and E obey the following set of linear integral equations:

Note that Cij is a traceless tensor. However, in general,

it is not symmetric. In the HS case, due to isotropy, the

local version of the HCS function f (0) is a function of

V 2, 2, and   (V · )2 [40­42]. This implies [26]

Cij - Cji = 2 f (0)/ (V · )(Vji - Vij). On the

other hand, the vectors V and  are mutually orthogonal

in the HD case and hence the tensor Cij is symmetric in

the two-dimensional geometry.

The formal derivation from Eq. (3.9) of the constitutive equations for the pressure tensor and the heat flux follows the same steps as in Sec. V of Ref. [26], except that special care must be exerted to redo those steps keeping dt and dr generic. For the sake of conciseness, we skip some of the technical details.

It is interesting to remark that the rotational-totranslational temperature ratio is affected by the presence of  · u. Taking the trace in both sides of Eq.

of the dyadic products of those three vectors. However, V   in a HD system, and thus A and B are vector functions residing in the two-dimensional subspace V of translational velocities, so that they can be expressed as linear combinations of the mutually orthogonal vectors V and V ×  (which form an orthogonal basis of V), where the latter vector product is done in the embedding space E = VW, W being the one-dimensional subspace where angular velocities live. Then, in the case of disks, Cij is a linear combination of the dyadic products of the two vectors V and V ×  only.

A. Sonine-like approximation for Ai, Bi Cij, and E

In order to get explicit expressions for the NSF transport coefficients we need to resort to approximations. We will proceed in two steps. First, the structure of Eqs. (3.11) suggests to propose the following approximate forms for the solutions of Eqs. (3.10):

where  is defined by Eq. (2.18) and the  coefficients remain to be determined. In the case of conservative collisions ( = || = 1), f (0) is the Maxwellian equilibrium distribution and then Eqs. (4.1) define the simplest Sonine approximation [44, 45]. Therefore, Eqs. (4.1) will be referred to as a Sonine-like approximation.
Inserting Eqs. (4.1) into the first equalities in Eqs. (3.16), one can relate the transport coefficients to the  coefficients as follows:

IV. EXPLICIT EXPRESSIONS FOR THE TRANSPORT COEFFICIENTS
All the expressions in Sec. III are formally exact within the Chapman­Enskog scheme but they are not explicit since neither the zeroth-order VDF f (0) nor the solutions to the linear integral equations (3.10) are known exactly.
By symmetry arguments, A and B can be expressed, in the HS case, as linear combinations of the vectors V, (V · ), and V × , while Cij is a linear combination

are, respectively, the shear viscosity and thermal conductivity in the elastic ( = 1) and smooth ( = -1)
case. Appendix B shows that the  coefficients can be expressed in terms of collision integrals involving the HCS VDF f (0).

B. Approximate form for f (0)
Thus far, we did not need in this section to specify the VDF f (0). Furthermore, the dependence on the number of degrees of freedom dt and dr in the equations above obeys to purely geometric considerations from the point of view that the explicit form of the collision rules has not been used yet. Now, as a second step in the quest for explicit expressions for the transport coefficients, we adopt the semi-Maxwellian approximation (2.14), which implies that the cumulants a(200) and a(101) [see Eqs. (3.17)] vanish. As a matter of fact, it has been previously observed [40­42] that those cumulants are indeed generally small, at least in the HS case. Equation (2.14) allows us to carry out the collision integrals in Eqs. (B1) and (B2) by applying the collision rules, which include vector products (see Appendix A). This gives rise to a much subtler and complex dependence on the number of degrees of freedom dt and dr [28], which we simplify under the constraints that the results remain being valid for threedimensional rough HS (dt = dr = 3), two-dimensional rough HD (dt = 2, dr = 1), and d-dimensional smooth particles (dt = d, dr  0). The algebra involved in the computation of the collision integrals is rather tedious, so here we only provide the final results. A summary of the main explicit expressions obtained by the combination of Eqs. (2.14) and (4.1) is presented in Table I. Those expressions are equivalent, in the HS case (dt = dr = 3), to those shown in Table I of Ref. [26].

V. RESULTS
A. Limiting cases
While Table I gives the transport coefficients in terms of the coefficients of restitution (, ), the reduced moment of inertia (), and the number of degrees of freedom (dt, dr), it is interesting to consider some important limiting cases.
The first situation will correspond to a d-dimensional gas of smooth particles. In that case, dt  d and, instead of directly taking   -1 (which is a singular

limit, as seen below), we formally take dr  0. Since the rotational-to-translational temperature ratio lacks any

physical meaning in the purely smooth case, we will take

 = finite, its precise value not being needed. Actually,

Eq. (2.20) shows that, on purely mathematical grounds,

limdr0  = finite if  > | - |/1 + . After taking the limit dr  0 in Table I, one can easily obtain the expressions shown in the second column of Table II. They

agree with previous results [30, 39] particularized to the

Maxwellian approximation. The same results are ob-

tained by formally setting  = 0 and then taking either

the limit   -1 or the limit   0, except that a

spurious factor t = 1 + dr/dt is attached to  and µ.

As said before, the quasismooth limit   -1 is sin-

gular and completely different from the smooth case [26].

This is due to the divergence of the temperature ratio as   (1 + )-2 [see Eq. (2.20)]. After carefully taking the

limit   -1, the results displayed in the third column of

Table II are obtained. As already noticed in Ref. [26], no

dependence on the reduced moment of inertia  remains

in the transport coefficients after taking the quasismooth

limit.

Figure 1 shows the differences between the smooth

and quasismooth (reduced) transport coefficients. In the cases of the shear viscosity  and the thermal conductivity , we observe that those coefficients are higher for

HS than for HS; additionally, they are higher for smooth

particles (monotonic behavior) than in the quasismooth

limit (nonmonotonic behavior). In what respects the bulk shear viscosity b, it vanishes for smooth particles, but not in the quasismooth limit, in which case it takes

higher values for HD than for HS. Finally, the Dufourlike coefficient µ vanishes in the quasismooth limit, but

not for smooth particles, the HD value being larger than

the HS one if  > 0.303.

As a third limiting situation, we now consider a sys-

tem of particles perfectly elastic ( = 1) and perfectly

rough ( = 1). Since energy is conserved by collisions

[see Eq. (A6)], the equipartition principle holds. In the

HS case, this system was first introduced about one hun-

dred years ago by Pidduck [25] and is frequently used

to model polyatomic molecules [44, 46, 47]. The results

for HS and HD gases are given in the fourth column of Table II. In the case of , PN () = N0 + N1 + N22 and PD() = D0 + D1 + D22 + D33 are polyno-
mials with coefficients (N0, N1, N2, D0, D1, D2, D3) = (10, 39, 24, 2, 11, 12, 21) and (37, 151, 50, 12, 75, 101, 102)

for HD and HS, respectively. It must be noted that,

when setting  =  = 1 in the expressions of Table I, we

took

the

of

using

(which

applies

to both HS and HD) in order to simplify the final results

for  and .

The dependence of , b, and  on the reduced moment of inertia for the HS and HD Pidduck gases is dis-

played in Fig. 2. Given a common value of /max, while the shear viscosity is higher for HD than for HS, the op-

posite happens in the case of the bulk viscosity (except

if /max > 0.718, in which case the HD curve is slightly

Moreover,  and  are the transport coefficients more sensitive to the dimensionality and to the mass distribution.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this study, we have considered a model of a granular gas as composed by spherical particles with constant coefficients of normal () and tangential () restitution. Previous results [26] for the transport coefficients of a dilute gas of inelastic and rough HS have been complemented with novel results for the parallel case of HD. We have developed this analysis in a unified vector space framework, based on previous works [28, 29], which allows us to obtain general expressions in terms of the number of translational (dt) and rotational (dr) degrees of freedom. The choice of the embedding Euclidean threedimensional space is essential to get results for both geometries within a common framework. Particular aspects, especially the orthogonality condition between rotational and translational velocities in the HD case, permit us to neglect the computation of certain quantities and reduce them to already known HS terms being parameterized by dt - 2 or (dr - 1)/2 prefactors, as convenience, in the spirit of Refs. [28, 29].
The analysis has been carried out in the context of the nonlinear Boltzmann equation, where the system is assumed to be fully described by the one-particle VDF f (r, v, ; t). Under the assumptions of (i) small gradi-

11

ents of the hydrodynamic fields [number density n(r, t), flow velocity u(r, t), and granular temperature T (r, t)] and (ii) a "normal" solution (i.e., the space and time dependence of the one-particle VDF takes place through a functional dependence on n, u, and T ), the Chapman­ Enskog method has been used to solve the Boltzmann equation up to first order in the gradients. In that way, the NSF hydrodynamic equations are obtained by supplementing the balance equations for mass [Eq. (2.8a)], momentum [Eq. (2.8b)], and energy [Eq. (2.8e)] with constitutive equations for the pressure tensor Pij(r, t) [Eq. (3.14a)], the heat flux q(r, t) [Eq. (3.14b)], and the cooling rate (r, t) [Eq. (3.12)].
The derivation of the associated transport coefficients has been carried out along three successive stages of increasing concreteness and level of approximation. In a first stage, the transport coefficients are expressed [see Eqs. (3.16) and (3.18)] in terms of collision integrals involving the zeroth-order (HCS) VDF f (0) and the functions A, B, Cij, and E characterizing the first-order VDF f (1) [see Eq. (3.9)]; those functions are the solutions of a set of linear integral equations [see Eqs. (3.10)] with inhomogeneous terms related to f (0) [see Eqs. (3.11)]. Next, in a second stage, Sonine-like forms for the functions A, B, Cij, and E is assumed [see Eqs. (4.1)], with coefficients (At , Ar , Bt , Br , C , and E) that can be expressed in terms of collisional integrals involving f (0) [see Eqs. (B2) and (B3)]. Finally, as the third and final stage, the HCS VDF f (0) is approximated by the product of a Maxwellian translational VDF times the marginal rotational VDF [see Eq. (2.14)]. The resulting explicit expressions for the transport coefficients as functions of the coefficients of restitution ( and ), the reduced moment of inertia (), and the numbers of degrees of freedom (dt and dr) are displayed in Table I. In general, the transport coefficients exhibit a rather complex nonlinear dependence on , , and , as exposed in the density plots of Figs. 3­7.
The choice (dt, dr) = (3, 3) allows us to recover known results for three-dimensional HS [26], except that in our approach we do not need to assume a Maxwellian form for the marginal rotational VDF. Moreover, novel results for two-dimensional HD are derived via the choice (dt, dr) = (2, 1). Thus, the outcome quantities can be used as a unified set of formulae for theoretical and experimental researchers, as well as a source of comparison between HD and HS setups.
Some special limiting cases have been exposed in Table II: smooth, quasismooth, and Pidduck's limits. The common description in terms of translational and rotational degrees of freedom let a direct recovery of the purely smooth case results by formally taking the limit dr  0 at fixed , thus circumventing the singular nature of the quasismooth limit   -1. In the latter limit, a universal lack of dependence on  of the transport coefficients, already seen for HS [26], is observed. The quasismooth limit is quite distinct from the purely smooth case, as shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we have extended the orig-

inal Pidduck's system [25] ( =  = 1) to our description, and novel results for HD are obtained; the dependencies with the reduced moment of inertia are shown in Fig. 2, where one can observe that the values of the coefficients b and  with a uniform mass distribution are similar for the two considered setups. It is also interesting to remark that the transport coefficient () associated with the velocity-divergence correction of the cooling rate vanishes in all these limits, for both HD and HS, as expected.
An immediate application of this work is the use of the closed set of NSF hydrodynamic equations to analyze the stability of the HCS, again in a unified framework encompassing the special HS and HD cases. This is the subject of the companion paper [48]. Additionally, the extension of the results to stochastically driven granular gases is straightforward (since the evaluation of the collision integrals has already been done in the present paper) and will be published elsewhere. Another future goal of our research is to go back to the second stage mentioned above and assume a form for f (0) where excess velocity kurtoses and translational-rotational velocity correlations are not neglected. Preliminary results [49] are quite promising.
Lastly, we hope that this research will inspire future works in the field, which could provide simulation and experimental results to compare with, as well as the introduction of alternative collisional models to describe systems of inelastic and rough particles.

where Q is the impulse that particle 1 exerts on particle 2. Our collision model is based on the existence of two constant coefficients of restitution, normal (0 <   1) and tangential (-1    1), which are defined by the following relations:

 · g = -( · g),  × g = -( × g). (A2)

Here,

g = v12 -  × S12

(A3)

is the relative velocity of the contact points at the moment of collision, v12  v1 - v2 being the center-of-mass relative velocity and S12 = (1 + 2)/2 being directly related to the center-of-mass angular velocity. Then,
from the conservation of angular and linear momenta in each collision, the impulse can be expressed as [26]

Q = m( · v12) - m × ( × v12 + S12), (A4)

where coll(v, )  (v, ) - (v, ). One can observe that, except if  = 1 and either  = -1 or  = 1, the total kinetic energy is dissipated upon collisions. This expected fact is translated into a decay of the total granular temperature in Sec. II B.
The previous equations apply to both HS and HD. In
the HS case, the translational velocity v = vxi+vyj+vzk
and the angular velocity  = xi + yj+ zk have dt = 3 and dr = 3 nontrivial components, respectively. On the
other hand, in the HD case, v = vxi + vyj and  = zk have dt = 2 and dr = 1 nontrivial components, respectively, what simplifies the collision rules [50]. An important consequence of the distinction between spheres and disks is that the Jacobian of the transformation between pre- and postcollisional velocities turns out to depend on dr, namely

(v1 , v2 , 1 , 2 ) (v1, v2, 1, 2)

= ||2dr/dt .
