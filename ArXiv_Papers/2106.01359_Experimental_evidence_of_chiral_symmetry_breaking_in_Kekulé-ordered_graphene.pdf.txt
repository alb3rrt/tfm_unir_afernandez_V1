The low-energy excitations of graphene are relativistic massless Dirac fermions with opposite chiralities at valleys K and K . Breaking the chiral symmetry could lead to gap opening in analogy to dynamical mass generation in particle physics. Here we report direct experimental evidences of chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) from both microscopic and spectroscopic measurements in a Li-intercalated graphene. The CSB is evidenced by gap opening at the Dirac point, Kekul´e-O type modulation and chirality mixing near the gap edge. Our work opens up opportunities for investigating CSB related physics in a Kekul´e-ordered graphene.

Chiral symmetry breaking (CSB), namely, coupling of

Dirac fermions with opposite chiralities, leads to dynam-

ical mass generation for elementary particles [1], which

lays a cornerstone for the Standard Model in particle

physics. The low-energy excitations of graphene are

massless Dirac fermions [2, 3] with the electron spin re-

placed by the pseudospin, and therefore graphene pro-

vides a condensed matter physics analogue for investi-

gating CSB and mass generation indicated by band gap

opening [4­7]. In addition to gap opening, a series of in-

triguing phenomena have been proposed with CSB, such

as electron fractionalization [8] and topological effects

in the electron and phonon spectra [9, 10]. Experimen-

tal realization and unambiguous observation of CSB in

graphene are therefore highly desirable.



 In order to realize CSB, a superlattice period of ( 3 ×

3)R30 is required to couple Dirac cones from K and

K valleys, and such inter-valley coupling could lead to

replica Dirac cones at the Brillouin zone (BZ) center

and gap opening as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1(a).

Such superlattice period is inherent in the Kekul´e distor-

tion with modulated bond structure as indicated by red

and black bonds in Fig. 1(b). Experimentally, Kekul´e

distortion can be induced by a strong magnetic field [11­

13], which however also breaks the time reversal symme-

try and turns the conical dispersion into Landau levels.

Introducing dilute adatoms or defects [6, 14­16] or an ex-

ternal superlattice potential [17­19] provides an attrac-

tive pathway for realizing CSB while still preserving the

conical dispersion. Along this path, important progress has been made in graphene grown on Cu substrate, where Kekul´e-Y order with "Y"-shaped bond modulation as shown in Fig. 1(c) has been revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) [14]. However, there is no evidence of gap opening, and recent theoretical calculation suggests that such Kekul´e-Y ordered graphene would remain gapless, while Kekul´e-O order where modulated bonds form an "O"-shape pattern as shown in Fig. 1(d) is gapped [15]. Superlattice period of ( 3 × 3)R30 has also been reported in Li or Ca intercalated graphene [20­26] or graphite [27, 28], making them potential candidates for realizing CSB. However, experimental evidences such as CSB induced gap opening, specific type of Kekul´e order and chirality mixing near the gap edge, which are crucial for establishing the CSB, are still missing.
Here by combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and STM measurements, we provide direct experimental evidences for CSB in a Liintercalated graphene from both electron spectroscopic and microscopic measurements. The CSB is confirmed by CSB induced gap opening in the Dirac cone, Kekul´eO type texture in the surface topography and chirality mixing near the gap edge.
The Kekul´e order is introduced by intercalating Li [20] to monolayer graphene on SiC substrate (see Fig. S1 and Supplemental Material for more details [29]). The intercalation releases the bonding between the buffer layer [30] and the SiC substrate, which transforms the buffer layer into a new graphene layer [20, 25] and results in two graphene layers in the AA stacking [26] as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2(a). We note that intercala-

tion of the buffer layer does not lead to Kekul´e order [25, 42], and two graphene layer structure as shown in Fig. 2(a) has the minimum thickness required to stabilize the Kekul´e order. After intercalation, the Fermi surface map in Fig. 2(b) shows two trigonal pockets at each BZ

corner, a hexagonal star-shaped pocket at the  point and arcs near the M point. The small and large triangular
pockets originate from the top and bottom graphene layers respectively, with carrier concentrations of 1.3×1014 cm-2 and 4.3×1014 cm-2 calculated from the size of the

3

Fermi pockets using the Luttinger theorem [31]. The star-shaped pocket at  is formed by the superposition of the folded inner triangular pockets from K and K by the reciprocal Kekul´e superlattice vector (see schematic drawing in Fig. 2(c)). Replicas of the larger triangular pockets folded from K and K to , and K to K or vice versa are also observed near the M point (pointed by gray arrows in Fig. 2(b)). The existence of folded Dirac cones by ( 3 × 3)R30 superlattice modulation [21, 22, 28, 32] is not sufficient for generating a mass gap, and further experimental evidences are needed to confirm the CSB with a gap opening, which is the main focus of this work.
An important evidence is the gap opening at the Dirac point, which is revealed by ARPES dispersions measured through both  and K points shown in Fig. 2, and more data around these points are shown in Figs. S2 and S3 [29]. A gap of 380 ± 10 meV is clearly identified for the upper Dirac cone (inner pocket) from the dispersion image shown in Fig. 2(d) as well as energy distribution curves (EDCs) shown in Fig. 2(e). Such gap value corresponds to an effective mass of m = 0.033 me, where me is the free electron mass. The gap opening is also observed in the dispersion image measured along an equivalent cut through the K point (Fig. 2(f)). Here, not only the upper Dirac cone but also the lower Dirac cone with a larger pocket is clearly resolved. The upper Dirac cone shows a gap value consistent with Fig. 2(d) with the Dirac point at -1.27 eV (broken line in Fig. 2(e)), and the lower Dirac cone shows a gap of 410 ± 50 meV (m = 0.036 me) with the Dirac point at -1.82 eV (broken line in Fig. 2(g)). Our ARPES data show that these two Dirac cones are both gapped and shifted in energy, as schematically summarized in Fig. 2(h). A gap was observed previously, yet its origin was elusive [21]. Here first-principles calculations are performed to support the CSB origin of the gap. The calculated band dispersion (Fig. S5(a),(d) [29]) with the most stable Li configuration (Fig. S4 [29]) is in agreement with the experimental observation. Moreover, a comparison of calculated dispersions with either the bottom or top Li layer removed (Fig. S5 [29]) shows that the intercalated Li layer between the two graphene layers contributes dominantly to the gap opening. Because this Li layer is also critical for the formation of the ( 3× 3)R30 Kekul´e order, our comparison indicates a close correlation between the gap opening and the Kekul´e order.
As noted above, recent theoretical calculation shows that only a specific type of Kekul´e order can generate a gap opening [15], and therefore it is important to identify the specific type of Kekul´e order. Here we directly probe the spatially-resolved electronic properties by performing STM topographic measurements at different bias voltages. Away from the Dirac point energy, for example at -0.1 eV (Fig. 3(a)), the STM topography shows a honeycomb structure which is typical

of graphene, while at energies near the gap regions of the two Dirac cones (Fig. 3(b)-(e)), the STM topography clearly demonstrates strongly modified topography, with a periodic arrangement of expanded hexagons (labeled by thicker blue bonds) alternating with highly distorted hexagons compatible with the Kekul´e-O type pattern. Such Kekul´e-O order is critical for inducing CSB gap [15]. Compared to other decorated graphene [14, 22, 23, 25] where ( 3 × 3)R30 Kekul´e order is also observed in the fast Fourier transformation image (inset of Fig. 3(c)), our work is the first to demonstrate Kekul´e-O type modulation and to show that it exists only near the gap edge of the Dirac cone as schematically summarized in Fig. 3(f), by combining the advantages of both STM and ARPES measurements. The fact that the Kekul´e-O pattern is observed only near the gap edge indicates that it is a modulation of the electronic states rather than a simple modulation of the lattice which is energy independent. This suggests that although the CSB has a somewhat different origin (induced by an external superlattice potential imposed by the intercalated Li atoms rather than a spontaneous Coulomb interaction in quantum electrodynamics [33]), the results of the CSB, including CSB induced gap opening and modulated electronic states near the gap edge, remain the same.
We make one step further by pursuing the evolution of the chirality mixing near the gap edge through polarization-dependent ARPES measurements. Figure 4(a)-(d) shows Fermi surface maps measured using four different light polarizations, where the zigzag (-K) direction is in the scattering plane (see experimental geometry in Fig. 4(j)). The pseudospin selection rules can be derived following previous work [34], and similar measurements have been applied to reveal the Berry phase of graphene [34­36], which is the accumulated phase of the pseudospin around a closed loop. Here we extend the analysis to further extract energy- and momentumresolved pseudospin and chirality in our Kekul´e-ordered graphene (see Supplemental Material for more details on the analysis method [29]). In particular, the x and y components of the pseudospin for each point in the Dirac cone can be extracted from the linear dichroism (LD) and circular dichroism (CD) ARPES by

where Ip, Is, ILCP and IRCP correspond to ARPES in-

tions. Note that K and K are related by the time reversal symmetry, H^K = -v · p^, and the pseudospin at K is defined as  = (x, -y) [2].

chirali-

ties (represented by red and blue colors) are observed for

folded Dirac cones from K and K at EF (Fig. 4(g)), en-

dorsing the validity of this analysis method. Moreover,

chirality maps measured at different energies (Fig. 4(h))

and chirality-resolved dispersion image along the -K di-

rection (Fig. 4(i)) show that although a strong chirality

contrast is observed away from the Dirac point (e.g., at

EF and -2.4 eV), the chirality contrast becomes negligible in regions where folded Dirac cones from K and K

(blue and red curves) overlap (pointed by black arrows in

Fig. 4(i)), indicating that there is no well-defined chirality

near the gap edge of the upper Dirac cone. We note that

weak yet detectable chirality contrasts are observed at

-1.0 eV on both sides of the upper Dirac cone, which are

contributed by the lower Dirac cone away from the Dirac

point (see Fig. S6 [29]). Analysis of the energy-dependent

chirality for the upper Dirac cone is shown in Fig. S7 [29],

which shows that the chirality contrast decreases gradu-

ally when moving toward the Dirac point and becomes

negligible near the gap edge. Such energy dependent chirality made available by polarization-dependent ARPES measurements confirms the chirality mixing near the gap edge, providing another important experimental evidence for CSB.
The observation of replica Dirac cones with CSB induced gap opening, Kekul´e-O patterned topography and chirality mixing near the gap edge together provides definitive experimental evidences for CSB in a condensed matter physics system, in analogy to the mass generation in particle physics. Moreover, the experimental realization of CSB in the Kekul´e-ordered graphene provides new opportunities for exploring CSB related physics, such as electron fractionalization [8] and topological effect [9, 10].
