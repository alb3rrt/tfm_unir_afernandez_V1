## Abstract

We give an explicit solution of a q-Riemann Hilbert problem which arises in the theory of orthogonal polynomials, prove that it is unique, and deduce several properties. Our new results include the asymptotic behaviour of zeroes in the limit as the degree of the polynomial approaches infinity.
