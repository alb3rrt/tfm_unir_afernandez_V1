Abstract. A graph is near-bipartite if its vertex set can be partitioned into an independent set and a set that induces a forest. It is clear that near-bipartite graphs are 3-colorable. In this note, we show that planar graphs without cycles of lengths in {4, 6, 8} are near-bipartite.
1. Introduction
A graph is k-degenerate if each subgraph has a vertex of degree at most k. Every k-degenerate graph is (k + 1)-colorable. Borodin [1] in 1976 suggested to partition the vertex set of a graph into two sets that induce graphs with better degeneracy properties. A graph G is (a, b)-partitionable if its vertices can be partitioned into sets A and B such that the subgraph induced by A is adegenerate and the subgraph induced by B is b-degenerate. Borodin [1] conjectured that every planar graph, which is 5-degenerate, is (1, 2)- and (0, 3)-partitionable. Thomassen [10, 11] confirmed these conjectures.
Clearly a graph is bipartite if and only if it is (0, 0)-partitionable. A graph is called near-bipartite if it is (0, 1)-partitionable. Recognizing near-bipartite graphs can be seen as restricted variants of the 3-coloring problem, which is well known to be NP-complete [9]. Borodin and Glebov [2] showed that every planar graph of girth at least 5 is near-bipartite (see [7] for an extension of this result). Dross, Montassier, and Pinlou [6] asked whether every triangle-free planar graph is near-bipartite. Borodin, Glebov, Raspaud, and Salavatipour [5] proved that planar graphs without cycles of length from 4 to 7 are 3-colorable. Wang and Chen [12] showed that planar graphs without {4, 6, 8}-cycles are 3-colorable. In this paper, we improved this result by showing that planar graphs without {4, 6, 8}-cycles are near-bipartite. Some tricks in the proof resemble those first appeared in [2, 5] and further developed in [3, 4].
Theorem 1.1. Every planar graph without {4,6,8}-cycles is near-bipartite.
An IF-coloring of a graph is a partition of its vertices into two parts such that one part colored I induces an independent set and the other part colored F induces a forest. Given a graph G and a cycle C in G, an IF -coloring C of G[V (C)] superextends to G if there exists an IF -coloring G of G that extends  with the property that there is no path joining two vertices of C all of whose vertices are colored F and do not belong to C. We say that C is superextendable to G if every

IF -coloring C of G[V (C)] superextends to G. When we wish to specify G, we will say (G, C) is superextendable.
Instead of Theorem 1.1, we actually proved a stronger result:
Theorem 1.2. For every planar graph G without {4,6,8}-cycles and any cycle C in G of length at most 12, (G, C) is superextendable.
By [2], every planar graph of girth 5 has an IF -coloring. Since G contains no 4-cycles, G must have a triangle. Thus Theorem 1.1 follows from Theorem 1.2 easily.
Graphs mentioned in this paper are all simple. Let d(v) be the degree of v. A k-vertex (k+vertex, k--vertex) is a vertex of degree k (at least k, at most k). The same notation will be applied to faces and cycles. Let C be a cycle of a plane graph G. We use int(C) and ext(C) to denote the sets of vertices located inside and outside C, respectively. The cycle C is called a separating cycle if int(C) =  = ext(C). We still use C to denote the set of vertices of C. An F -cycle is a cycle whose vertices are all colored F , and an F -path is path whose vertices are colored F .
2. Reducible Configurations
Let (G, C0) be a counterexample to Theorem 1.2 with minimum (G) = |V (G)| + |E(G)|, where C0 is a cycle of length at most 12 in G that is precolored. If C0 is a separating cycle, then C0 is superextendable in both G - ext(C0) and G - int(C0). Thus, C0 is superextendable in G, contrary to the choice of C0. Thus, we may assume that C0 is the boundary of the outer face of G in the rest of this paper. Call a vertex v internal if v / C0, call a face f internal if f = C0 and truly internal if V (f )  V (C0) = .
Lemma 2.1. Every internal vertex in G has degree at least 3.
Proof. Suppose there is an internal 2--vertex v in G. By minimality of (G, C0), the IF -coloring of C can superextend to G - v. If v has a neighbor colored I, then color v with F , otherwise, color v with I. In all cases, C0 superextends to G, a contradiction.
Lemma 2.2. The graph G has no separating cycle of length at most 12.
Proof. Suppose otherwise that C is a separating cycle of length at most 12 in G. Then C is inside of C0. By the minimality of (G, C0), (G - int(C), C0) is superextendable, and after that, G[V (C)] is colored. By the minimality of (G, C0) again, (C  int(C), C) is superextendable. Thus, (G, C0) is superextendable, a contradiction.
Lemma 2.3. The following are true about C0. (1) C0 is chordless. (2) Every non-adjacent pair v0 and v1 on C0 have no internal common neighbors.
Proof. (1) If C0 has a chord, then by Lemma 2.2, V (C0) = V (G). But by definition, the precoloring of C0 is already a good IF-coloring of G.
(2) Let w be an internal common neighbor of v0, v1  V (C0) with v0v1  E(G). Let P1 and P2 be the two paths of C0 with ends v0 and v1. Then both P1 + v0wv1 and P2 + v0wv1 are cycles of length at most 12. By Lemma 2.2, N (w)  V (C0). Note that d(w)  3 by Lemma 2.1. So w has at least one neighbor, by symmetry say v2 is on the segment of C0 from v1 to v0 in the clockwise order. Let Pi be the path of C0 with ends vi, vi+1 for i  [3] (index module 3) in the clockwise order. Let Ci = Pi + viwvi+1 for i  [3]. Note that |C1| + |C2| + |C3|  18. Without loss of generality, let
2

|C1|  |C2|  |C3|. Since G contains no {4, 6, 8}-cycles, |C1|  {3, 5}; and when |C1| = 3, |C2|  9; when |C1| = 5, |C2|  7. In any case, min{3 + 9 + 9, 5 + 7 + 7} > 18, a contradiction.
Lemma 2.4. Every truly internal 5-face is incident to at most four 3-vertices.
Proof. Suppose otherwise that f = [v1v2v3v4v5] is a truly internal 5-face with five 3-vertices. Let ui be the neighbor of vi not on f for i  [5]. Let G be the graph obtained by identifying v3 and u1 of G - {v1, v2, v4, v5}. Note that if the identification creates an edge between vertices of C0, then u1, u3  V (C0), but the path between them along C0 with u1v1v2v3u3 forms a separating cycle of length at most 12, a contradiction to Lemma 2.2. It follows that the precoloring of C0 remains valid in G. Furthermore, if there is a path Q of length at most 8 between v3 and u1, then G has a separating cycle of length at most 11 which is obtained from the path u1v1v2v3 and Q, contrary to Lemma 2.2. So G contains no {4, 6, 8}-cycles. Since |V (G)| < |V (G)|, we can extend the coloring of C0 to G. Now we can extend this coloring to an IF -coloring of G in the following way.
First assume that the new vertex created by the identification is colored I. Then we color u1 and v3 with I and v1, v2, v4 with F . If u5 is colored with F , then color v5 with I. If u5 is colored with I, then color v5 with F , which is invalid only if u2 and u4 are both colored F , in which case, we recolor v3 with F and v2, v4 with I. Note that we create neither F -cycle nor F -path between two vertices of C0.
Now assume that the new vertex created by the identification is colored F . First we color u1 and v3 with F . Note that there exists no F -path between u1 and v3 in G. If u4 is colored I, then color v1, v4 with F , and for each i  {2, 5}, color vi with a color different from ui; this is not a valid coloring only if u2 and u5 are both colored I, in which case we recolor v1 with I. So we may assume that u4 is colored F . Color v1, v4 with I and v2, v3, v5 with F , we obtain a valid coloring, unless we create an F -cycle or an F -path between two vertices of C0. In the bad cases, u2 and u3 are colored F . We may further assume that u5 is colored F , for otherwise we can color v2, v4 with I and v1, v3, v5 with F to obtain a valid coloring.
Consider the case that ui is colored F for i  [5]. Note that there is no F -path between u1 and u3, and there cannot exist F -path between u1 and C0 and between u3 and C0 at the same time, since G has a valid coloring. By symmetry, we may assume that there is no F -path between u3 and C0. There must be an F -path, say P , between u2 and u3, for otherwise we obtain a valid coloring by coloring v2, v3, v5 with F and v1, v4 with I. We color v1, v2, v4 with F and v3, v5 with I. Since the F -path u1v1v2u2 in G can be replaced with the F -path u1(v3)u3P u2 in G, this cannot be F -cycle or F -path containing u1v1v2u2 in G. Therefore we obtain a valid coloring.
A 3-vertex v  C0 is bad if v is on a 3-face. A tetrad in a plane graph is a path v1v2v3v4 of four internal 3-vertices contained in the boundary of a face, so that both v1v2 and v3v4 are edges of triangles.
Lemma 2.5. G contains no tetrad. Consequently, no face of G is incident with five consecutive bad vertices. Furthermore, if a face of G is incident with consecutive vertices v0, v1, . . . , v5 and the vertices v1, . . . , v4 are bad, then the edges v0v1, v2v3 and v4v5 are incident with triangles.
Proof. Let v1v2v3v4 be a tetrad in G. Let N (v1) = {x, v2, v1 } and N (v4) = {y, v3, v4 }, where x, y are not in the triangles. Let G be the graph obtained by identifying y and v1 of G - {v1, v2, v3, v4}. Note that the identification does not create a chord in C0 or identify two vertices of C0. For otherwise, there exists a path P of length 4 or 5, which is internally disjoint from C0, between two
3

vertices of C0, and since |C0|  12, there exists a cycle in P  C0 of length at most 11 that separates x and v4, contrary to Lemma 2.2. There is no path Q of length at most 8 between y and v1 , for otherwise G would have a cycle separating K of length at most 12 that is obtained from the path yv3v2v1v1 and Q, contrary to Lemma 2.2. Thus, no new 8--cycles are created in G. This implies that G contains no {4, 6, 8}-cycles. Since |V (G)| < |V (G)|, the precoloring of C0 can be extended to an IF -coloring of G. Now we extend it to an IF -coloring of G.
First we color v1 and y with the color of the identified vertex. If v1 , y are colored I, then color v1, v2, v4 with F and color v3 with a color different from the color of v4 , and we obtain a valid coloring. So we assume that v1 , y are colored F . Then there exists no F -path between v1 and y in G. Assume first that v4 is colored I. If x is colored I, then color v1, v3, v4 with F and v2 with I; if x is colored F , then color v1 with I and v2, v3, v4 with F . In either case, we obtain a valid coloring. Let v4 be colored F . If x is colored I, then color v2, v4 with I and v1, v3 with F , and we obtain a valid coloring. So we assume x is also colored F . Since there is no F -path between v1 and y, either there is no F -path between v1 and v4 or there is no F -path between v4 and y. Also, there is at most one F -path between {v1 , y} and C0. If there is no F -path between v1 and C0 nor between v1 and v4 , then color v1, v4 with I and v2, v3 with F ; if there is no F -path between y and C0 nor between y and v4 , then color v1, v3 with I and v2, v4 with F ; in either of these cases, we obtain a valid coloring. We consider the other two cases.
· Case 1: no F -path between v1 and C0 nor between y and v4 . We may assume that there are F -paths between v1 and v4 (say P ) and between y and C0. Since the F -path P in G can be replaced with the F -path y(v1 )P v4 in G, there is no F -path between v4 and C0. Then we can color v1, v3 with I and v2, v4 with F to obtain a valid coloring.
· Case 2: no F -path between y and C0 nor between v1 and v4 . We may assume that there are F -paths between v1 and C0 and between v4 and y (say P ). Since the F -path P in G can be replaced with the F -path v1 (y)P v4 in G, there is no F -path between v4 and C0. Then we can color v1, v4 with I and v2, v3 with F to obtain a valid coloring.
Now suppose that f is incident with five consecutive bad vertices v1, . . . , v5. Since v3 is on a 3-face and G contains no adjacent 3-faces, either v2v3 or v3v4 is an edge on a 3-face. In the former case, v4v5 is an edge on a 3-face; in the latter case, v1v2 must be an edge of a 3-face. This implies that either v2v3v4v5 or v1v2v3v4 is a tetrad, a contradiction.
For the furthermore part, if a face of G is incident with consecutive vertices v0, v1, . . . , v5 and the vertices v1, . . . , v4 are bad, then either each of v1v2, v3v4 is an edge of a 3-face or each of v0v1, v2v3, v4v5 is an edge incident with a triangle. But the former cannot happen, as the path v1v2v3v4 is a tetrad and each of v1, . . . , v4 is a bad vertex.
3. Discharging Procedure
We are now ready to present a discharging procedure that will complete the proof of Theorem 1.2. Let x  V (G)  (F (G) - C0) have an initial charge of µ(x) = d(x) - 4, and µ(C0) = |C0| + 4. By Euler's Formula, xV F µ(x) = 0. Let µ(x) be the charge of x  V  F after the discharge procedure. To lead to a contradiction, we shall prove that µ(x)  0 for all x  V (G)  F (G) and µ(C0) > 0.
Let v be a 4-vertex on a face f . The vertex v  C0 is poor to f if either v is incident with a 3-face that is not adjacent to f , or v is incident with two 3-faces both adjacent to f , or v is incident with a 5-face adjacent to f . A 2-vertex u  C0 is special if u is on an internal 5-face.

Lemma 3.2. Every internal face in G has nonnegative final charge.

Proof. Let f be an internal face in G. Recall that G contains no {4, 6, 8}-cycles. For d(f ) = 3,

we only need to show that f has nonnegative charge before it sends charge to C, without loss of

generality, we still use µ(f ) to denote it.

Suppose d(f ) = 5. If V (f )C0 = , then f is incident with at most four 3-vertices by Lemma 2.4.

By

(R2),

f

then

If

|V (f )  C0|

then

f

thus

by

(R3)

f

gets

1 3

from

the

incident vertex on C0

and by (R2) gives

1 3

to

each of

at most four incident

If

|V

then

f

contains

no

and

gives

1 3

to

each

of

at

three

incident

internal

3-vertices. If |V (f )  C0| = 3, then f shares exactly one 2-vertex with C0 by Lemma 2.3, thus by

Suppose d(f ) = 7. Then f is not adjacent to any 3-faces and contains at most four 2-vertices.

If f contains a 2-vertex, then f shares at least two 3+-vertices with C0, and f gives no charge to

only

if

f

with

seven

bad

3-vertices and two other internal non-bad 3-vertices or poor 4-vertices. But when f contains seven

bad 3-vertices, at least four bad 3-vertices are consecutive on f . By Lemma 2.5, there are exactly

four bad consecutive vertices on f = v1 . . . v9, say v1, v2, v3, v4, and v9 and v5 should be 4+-vertices. As v6, v7, v8 are bad 3-vertices, v5 or v9, by symmetry say v5, is not on another 5--face. Then f
gives no charge to v5 by (R2). Therefore, there is no 9-face with negative final charge.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. By Lemma 3.1 and Lemma 3.2, it is sufficient for us to check that C0 has

positive final charge. By Lemma 2.3, if a 5-face shares 2-vertices with C0, then it shares exactly one

2-vertex with C0. Let P be a maximal path of C0 such that each vertex in V (P ) is either a special

2-vertex

or

a

neighbor

of

a

special

2-vertex.

By

(R4),

C0

gives

5 3

to

each

incident

special

2-vertex

and

1

to

each

a

u1

different 3-faces but on the same face, say f0, other than C0. It follows that f0 is adjacent to at

least two 3-faces, so it must be a 9+-face since G contains no {4, 6, 8}-cycles. By (R2), f0 gives out

4. Final remarks
Kang, Jin, and Wang [8] proved that planar graphs without {4,6,9}-cycles are 3-colorable. We believe that we could get the following result, by slightly modifying the proof of Theorem 1.2. We will keep it as a future work.

Problem 4.1. Every planar graph without {4,6,9}-cycles is near-bipartite.

A sketch of proof of Problem 4.1. We use the same discharging rules as the proof of

Theorem 1.2. The main difference is that we now have 8-faces to consider but have no 9-faces. In

the reducible configurations part, we need to consider the property of the outer face C0 carefully since the forbidden cycles have changed. In the discharging part, Now a 7-face f may share an

edge with one 3-face, but not more. If f contains a 2-vertex, then it contains at least two 3+-

vertices on C0, thus gives no charge to them. As f contains at most three 2-vertices by Lemma 2.3,

µ(f )

Then µ(f ) < 0 only if f

contains three 2-vertices

and one

internal triangle with two 3-vertices on f , but we have a separating cycle of length at most 12 in

this case. For 8-faces, they do not share edges with triangle and have at most four 2-vertices, so

We believe that planar graphs without cycles of lengths from 4 to 7 are near-bipartite, but failed to prove it. The trouble is that an 8-face may be adjacent to too many triangles when we try a similar approach to the proof of Theorem 1.2, which we cannot reduce. The condition in Theorem 1.2 excludes 8-cycles, and the conditions in Problem 4.1 excludes the difficult situation.
