## Abstract

Homeostasis can be used to guarantee the trigger of automated stabilization of relevant program-abstractions under every possible transformation of the program. Interestingly, Homeostasis provides such guarantees not only for the existing optimization passes but also for any future optimizations that may be added to the framework. We have implemented our proposed ideas in the IMOP compiler framework, for OpenMP C programs. We present an evaluation which shows that Homeostasis is efficient and easy to use.
