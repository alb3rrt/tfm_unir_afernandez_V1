GRADED p-POLAR RINGS AND THEIR ABELIAN-GROUP VALUED FUNCTORS
TILMAN BAUER
Abstract. As an extension of previous ungraded work, we define a graded p-polar ring to be an analog of a graded commutative ring where multiplication is only allowed on p-tuples (instead of pairs) of elements of equal degree. We show that the free affine p-adic group scheme functor, as well as the free formal group functor, defined on k-algebras for a perfect field k of characteristic p, factors through p-polar k-algebras. It follows that the same is true for any affine p-adic or formal group functor, in particular for the functor of p-typical Witt vectors. As an application, we show that the latter is free on the p-polar affine line.
1. Introduction
In [Bau20], I introduced the notion of a p-polar k-algebra, which, roughly speaking, is a k-module with a p-fold associative and commutative multiplication defined on it. Here p is a prime and k is any commutative ring. If k is a perfect field of characteristic p, I showed that the free affine abelian p-adic group functor on Spec R for a k-algebra R factors through the category of p-polar k-algebras, and as a result, so does the functor of points for every p-adic group defined over k.
In this sequel, I prove the corresponding results for graded commutative kalgebras, where k is a graded commutative field. Both the definition of a graded p-polar k-algebra and the proofs are quite distinct, but not independent, from the ungraded case, and the results are more striking in the presence of a grading. This is my excuse for writing a separate paper.
Definition. Let k be an graded commutative ring with degree-0 part k0 and A a graded k-module. Let Mk denote the category of k-modules A together with a graded symmetric k0-multilinear map µ : Ajk0 p  Ajp, and let polp : Algk  Mk denote the forgetful functor from graded commutative k-algebras to Mk, where µ is given by p-fold multiplication.
A graded p-polar k-algebra is an object A  Mk which is a subobject of polp(B) for some algebra B  Algk.
This definition agrees with the one given in [Bau20] when both k and A are concentrated in degree 0 (Lemma 2.7).
We denote the category of graded p-polar k-algebra by Polp(k) and its full subcategory of objects that are finite-dimensional as k-vector spaces by polp(k).

The restriction functors polp : Algk  Polp(k) and polp : algk  polp(k) defined on graded commutative k-algebras (resp. graded commutative k-algebras that are
finite dimensional as k-modules) are called polarization.

Definition. A graded field k is a graded commutative ring over which every graded
module is free. This implies that either k = k0 is an ungraded field concentrated in degree 0 or k = k0[u, u-1] for an ungraded field k0 and an element u of positive degree d, even unless k0 is of characteristic 2. We say that k is perfect if k0 is of characteristic 0 or if k0 is a perfect field of characteristic p and p  d.

Our main results parallel those in [Bau20]. Let AbSchk denote the category of representable, abelian-group-valued functors on Algk, and let AbSchpk denote the full subcategory of functors taking values in abelian pro-p-groups. Let Fgpsk be the category of ind-representable functors on algk taking values in abelian groups. We will refer to objects of AbSchk and Fgpsk as affine and formal groups, respectively.
Theorem 1.1. Let k be a perfect field of characteristic p and denote by Fr(R) the left adjoint of the forgetful functors AbSchpk  Algokp resp. Fgpsk  algokp. Then Fr factors through pol:

Algokp Fr
pol

AbSchpk;
F~r
Polp(k)op

algokp Fr
pol

Fgpsk
F~r
polp(k).

Corollary 1.2. Let k be a perfect field of characteristic p and M  AbSchpk or M  Fgpsk. Then M factors uniquely through pol:

Algk M {abelian pro-p-groups};

algk M Ab

pol

M~

pol

M~

Polp(k)

polp(k).

Proof. Given any M  AbSchk or M  Fgpsk, we have that
M (R) = Hom(Spec R, M ) = Hom(Fr(R), M ),
where the last Hom group is of objects of AbSchpk or Fgpsk, respectively. The Corollary follows from Thm. 1.1.
To prove Thm. 1.1, we define graded p-typical Witt vectors W (R) and co-Witt vectors CW (R) for evenly graded p-polar k-algebras R and Dieudonné equivalences
D : AbSchpk  Dmodpk
and Df : Fgpspk  D modFk
with certain categories of W (k)-modules with Frobenius and Verschiebung operations. Here Fgpspk denotes the full subcategory of Fgpsk of functors taking values in abelian p-groups.
We prove:

Theorem 1.3. Let R  Algk be an evenly graded commutative k-algebra when p > 2, or a graded, commutative k-algebra when p = 2.
There are natural isomorphisms Df (Fr(R)) = CW (R) for finite-dimensional R
and D(Fr(R)) = CW u(R)  µp (R k k¯)  W (k¯) Gal(k) for R  Algk,
where in the last factor, µp (A) denotes the p-power torsion in A×, invariants of the absolute Galois group Gal(k) acting diagonally on k¯ and W (k¯) are taken, and CW u denotes the unipotent part of CW .
Because the right-hand side is defined on p-polar algebras, so is the left hand side and hence, since D is an equivalence, also Fr(R). This is the main ingredient in proving Thm. 1.1.
As an application, we show:
Theorem 1.4. The affine group scheme of p-typical Witt vectors is the free unipotent abelian group scheme on the p-polar affine line, i.e. on the free p-polar algebra on a single generator.
This is an analog of the fact that the Hopf algebra representing the big Witt vectors, the algebra  of symmetric functions, is cofree on a polynomial ring in one generator [Haz03]. The corresponding Hopf algebra p for p-typical Witt vectors is definitely not cofree on a (non-polar) algebra.

2. Graded p-polar algebras

We begin the study of p-polar k-algebras with some observations and examples.

Remark 2.1. A graded p-polar k-algebra A does not supply a map Akp  A ­ only elements of the same degree can be multiplied together. In particular, a graded p-polar k-algebra is not a p-polar k-algebra when one forgets the grading.

Remark 2.2. The embeddability i : A  B into a graded commutative algebra
can be thought of as saying that for any elements x1, . . . , xn  A and scalars 1, . . . , m  k, there is at most one way of multiplying them together using µ (up to sign); namely, the element 1 · · · ki(x1) · · · i(xn)  B, which is either in the image of i or it isn't.

Example 2.3. If k = k0, the submodule k xpi | i  0  k[x] is a sub-p-polar algebra of pol(k[x]), where |x| > 0. It is the free p-polar algebra on a generator x. This shows that in contrast to the ungraded case, even for p = 2, p-polar algebras are much weaker structure than actual algebras.

Remark 2.4. If k = k0, it is apparent that for any p-polar algebra A, the submodule A(j) = i0 Ajpi is a polar subalgebra and direct factor, and that
A = A0 × A(j).
pj
If k = k0[u, u-1] with |u| = d > 0 and p  d, we see instead that

A(j) =

Aj pi +dl

i0,lZ

4

is a polar subalgebra and direct factor, and that

A = A(j),
j

where j runs through the residue classes of {jpi | i  0} in Z/dZ. We call a p-polar algebra of this form A(j) a p-typical polar algebra of degree j.
The inclusion of such p-polar algebras into all p-polar algebras is biadjoint to the functor A  A(j). We write pol(j)(A) := (pol(A))(j). This is a sub-p-polar algebra, but not a subalgebra of A.
In particular, if p > 2, we see that every graded p-polar k-algebra splits as a product A = Aodd×Aev, where Aodd = n A2n+1 and Aev the obvious complement.
Example 2.5. Consider the stable splitting P = (CP )^p  P1  · · ·  Pp-1 of the p-completion of complex projective space [McG81] with

H(Pi) = xj | j  i (mod p - 1) < Fp[x] = H(CP , Fp).

By [Sul74], Pp-1 is the suspension spectrum of a space (the classifying space of the Sullivan sphere), but all other Pi are not. However, the maps
Pi  P = (CP )^p --- ((CP )^p)p  P  · · ·  P  Pi  · · ·  Pi

induces a p-polar algebra structure on H~ (Pi), and the splitting P  P1  · · · Pp-1 induces a splitting of p-polar algebras in cohomology. In fact,

H(Pi; Fp) =

pol(j) H(P ; Fp)

ji (p-1) pj

So while the Pi are not spaces for i = p - 1, they do retain some likeness to spaces in that their cohomologies are p-polar algebras. This raises the question whether there is a reasonable notion of a "p-polar space" somewhere between connective spectra and spaces.

In a way, the definition of a p-polar k-algebra is wrong in the same way the definition of a manifold as a submanifold of Rn is wrong; it mentions an enveloping object which is not part of the data. The following proposition remedies this to a certain extent:

Proposition 2.6. The functor pol : Algk  Mk has a left adjoint given for A  Mk by
A  hull(A) = Sym(A)/(x1 · · · xp - µ(x1, . . . , xp) | x1, . . . , xp  Ai).
An object A  Mk is a p-polar k-algebra iff the unit map of this adjunction, u : A  pol(hull(A)), is injective.

Proof. The existence and structure of the left adjoint, hull, is obvious.
If u is injective, A is a p-polar algebra by definition. Conversely, if A is p-polar,
say i : A  pol(B) for some B  Algk, then by the universal property of the left adjoint, there is a factorization

A u pol(hull(A))

Since i is injective, so is u.

i
pol(B).

It is possible to give a list of axioms for objects of Mk to be a p-polar algebra, but that list becomes quite unwieldy in the general case. We will only do this in important special cases.

Lemma 2.7. If k = k0 and A = A0 (i.e. in the ungraded case), the definition of a p-polar k-algebra agrees with the one given in [Bau20]; i.e., A  Mk is p-polar iff
(ASSOC): For the symmetric group 2p-1 permuting the elements x1, . . . , xp, y2, . . . , yp  A, µ(µ(x1, . . . , xp), y2, . . . , yp)
is 2p-1-invariant.

Proof. Clearly, axiom (ASSOC) holds if A is p-polar. Conversely, suppose that

(ASSOC) holds, and let i : A  hull(A) be the adjunction unit. In [Bau20], it

was shown that (ASSOC) implies that for any i  0 and any set of 1 + i(p -

1) elements x1, . . . , x1+i(p-1), there is exactly one way of multiplying the xi to-

gether using µ, and any other number of elements cannot be multiplied together.

Write µ(x1, . . . , x1+i(p-1)) for this unique product. Let j :

 i=0

Sym1+i(p-1) (A)



Sym(A) be the inclusion and



hull(A)  B =

Sym1+i(p-1)(A)/j-1((x1 · · · xp - µ(x1, . . . , xp)))

i=0



=

Sym1+i(p-1)(A) / x1 · · · x1+i(p-1) - µ(x1, . . . , x1+i(p-1))

i=0
=A

We have thus exhibited A as a subobject of hull(A).

Next, we consider the important case of a graded p-polar k-algebra over an ungraded ring k = k0.
Lemma 2.8. Let A be an object in Mk, where k = k0 is ungraded. Then A is a p-polar k-algebra iff
(1) A0 is a p-polar k-algebra, and (2) For the symmetric group 2p permuting the elements x1, . . . , x2p  Aj and
elements y3, . . . , yp  Apj,
µ(µ(x1, . . . , xp), µ(xp+1, . . . , x2p), y3, . . . , yp)
is 2p-invariant (up to multiplication with the sign of the permutation if j is odd).

Proof. Again, the implication A p-polar  (1), (2) is straightforward. For the
converse, we may assume by Remark 2.4 without loss of generality that either A = A0 or A = A(j) is p-typical. Lemma 2.7 takes care of the first case, so assume A is p-typical and (2) holds.
For any graded p-typical k-module M = M(j), the free object TM in Mk on M is given inductively by

where (TM )n = 0 if n  Z. We call an element of (TM )n a monomial if it is either

by linearity, any element of TM is a linear combination of monomials. One could describe these monomial elements as some kinds of labelled trees. While this is a good picture to have in mind, I will not use that language.
Define an equivalence relation  on monomials in TM (and hence, by linear extension, on all of TM ) generated by
{{x1, . . . , xp}, {xp+1, · · · , x2p}, y3, · · · , yp}
 (-1)|x1|{{x1, . . . , xp-1, xp+1}, {xp, xp+2, · · · , x2p}, y3 , · · · , yp }
iff yj  yj for 3  h  p, xi  xi for 1  i  2p. Then TM /  is the free object in Mk satisfying (2). (Obviously, the 2p-equivariance is equivalent to the equivariance under interchanging xp and xp+1, given the guaranteed p × p-equivariance.)
There is a linear map f : TM  Sym(M )(j) given on monomials by f (m) = m for m  M and f ({x1, . . . , xp}) = {f (x1), . . . , f (xp)} for {x1, . . . , xp}  Symp(TM ). We claim that this map induces an injective map on TM /  with image Sym(A)(j).
To see this is the image, let X = {x1, . . . , xn}  Sym(M )jpN . If n = 1, {x1} = f (x1) and we are done. Otherwise, because M is p-typical, there has to be a partition of {1, . . . , n} into p parts I1, . . . , Ip such that for Xi = ±{xj | j  Ii}, |Xi| = jpN-1. Inductively, all Xi are in the image of f , hence so is X = f (X1, . . . , Xp).
We proceed to show injectivity. Let x  TM be a monomial. We say that y  TM occurs at depth d in x if either d = 0 and y = x or x = {x1, . . . , xp} and y occurs at depth d - 1 in xi for some i. Now suppose that y1 and y2 occur at a common depth d  1 in x = {x1, . . . , xp}, and let x  TM be the element obtained by interchanging y1 and y2. Then I claim that x  ±x. To see this, we proceed by induction. If d = 1 then the claim is true by symmetry. Suppose that d > 1. Then y1 occurs at depth d - 1 in some xi and y2 occurs at depth d - 1 in some xj. If i = j, we are done by induction. Otherwise, suppose without loss of generality that i = 1 and j = 2. Let x1 = {x11, . . . , x1p} and x2 = {x21, . . . , x2p}. Without loss of generality, suppose that yi occurs at depth d - 2 in xi1 for i = 1, 2. Then
x  ±x(1) = {x(11), . . . , x(p1)} = {{x11, x21, x13, . . . , x1p}, {x12, x22, . . . , x2p}, x3, . . . , xp}.
Then y1 and y2 occur at depth d - 1 in x(11) and by induction, x(11)  (x(1))1 = {x11, x21, x13, . . . , x1p}, the element obtained from x(11) by interchanging y1 and y2. But then
x  ±{{x11, x21, x13, . . . , x1p}, {x12, x22, . . . , x2p}, x3, . . . , xp}  {{x11, x12, . . . , x1p}, {x21, x22, . . . , x2p}, x3, . . . , xp} = x.
We conclude that if x, x  TM with f (x) = f (x) (i.e. they contain the same leaf elements at any given level), then x  x.
Now let A = A(j) be an object of Mk such that (2) holds and FA the quotient of (TA/ ) = Sym(A)(j) by the intersection of the ideal (x1 . . . xp - µ(x1, . . . , xp))  hull(A) with Sym(A)(j). Then the map A  FA is an isomorphism, showing that A  hull(A).
We finish the section with a characterization of the image of A  hull(A), i.e. a determination of which elements can be multiplied together.

Lemma 2.9. For p  d, denote by k(d) the field k = k0[u±1], where |u| = d and k0

is a fixed field of characteristic p. For p  j, let h(j, d) be the smallest h such that

d | (ph - 1)j. Denote by Mod(j)(d) the category of graded k(d)-modules M which

are p-typical in the sense that M =

h(j,d) i=0

Mjpi

.

Then the abelian categories

Mod(j)(d) and Mod(j)(d) are equivalent iff h(j, d) = h(j, d).

Proof. Suppose h(j, d) = h(j, d). For M  Mod(j)(d),

h(j,d)

M=

Mjpi .

i=0

Hence the desired equivalence of categories is given by a regrading

Pol(j)(d)  Pol(j)(d), M  M ,

where (M )jpi = Mjpi .
Conversely, observe that any projective generator of Mod(j)(d) must have k0dimension at least h(j, d). Since any equivalence  : Mod(j)(d)  Mod(j)(d) sends projective generators to projective generators, it follows that h(j, d) = h(j, d).

Corollary 2.10. Denote by Pol(j)(d) the category of p-typical, p-polar k(d)-algebras of degree j. Then Pol(j)(d)  Pol(j)(d) iff h(j, d) = h(j, d).
Proof. One direction follows directly from Lemma 2.9 because the equivalence of categories Mod(j)(d)  Mod(j)(d) extends to the desired equivalence of p-polar algebras. Counting the minimal dimension of a generator for Pol(j)(d) gives the reverse conclusion.

Corollary 2.11. For any p  d and d  j, there exists h  0 such that Pol(j)(d)  Pol(1)(ph - 1).
Proof. h(1, ph - 1) = h.

Proposition 2.12. Let A = A(j) be a Z/dZ-graded, p-typical polar k-algebra, where p  d. Denote by h the smallest positive integer satisfying phj  j (mod d). Let x1, . . . , xn be elements in A, of which exactly ni have degree jpi for i = 0, . . . , h - 1, and hence ni = n. Then x1 · · · xn  Ajpm is in im( : A  hull(A)) iff
h-1
np  pm (mod ph - 1).
=0
In this proposition, the Z-graded case is included with d = 0 and h = .

Proof. Denote by S the set of sequences n = (n0, . . . , nh-1) of nonnegative integers, and call n multipliable if for some, and hence any, set x1, . . . , xn of elements of A with degrees prescribed by n, x1 · · · xn  im(). Define an equivalence relation on S by n  n iff either both or none of n and n are multipliable.
We have that

(n0, . . . , ni + p, . . . , nh-1)  (n0, . . . , ni, ni+1 + 1, . . . , nh-1)
for 0  i < h - 1 because if in the sequence x1, . . . , xn, the elements x1, . . . , xp have degree jpi, x1 . . . xn  im() iff µ(x1, . . . , xp)xp+1 · · · xn  im(). Thus, inductively,
(n0, . . . , nh-1)  (n0 + n1p + · · · + nh-1ph-1, 0, . . . , 0).

The question is thus reduced to the question of when for x1, . . . , xn  Aj , x1 . . . xn  hull(A)jpm is in the image of . If k = pm (mod pj - 1) for any k, Ajn = 0 and hence this is a necessary condition. If k = pm for some m, x1 · · · xn  im(). Furthermore, since phj  j (mod d), µ(x1, . . . , xph )  Aj, so the product of any n = pm + l(ph - 1) elements of degree j is in im().
Corollary 2.13. Let k be a perfect graded field with |u| = d and A = A(j) be a p-typical polar k-algebra with d  j. Let  be the regrading isomorphism
 : Pol(j)(d)  Pol(1)(ph(j,d) - 1).
Then A  -1 hull((A))(1) is an isomorphism.
Proof. When j = 1 and d = ph - 1,  is the identity and the claim follows from Prop. 2.12. The general case follows because  is an equivalence.

3. Graded Witt vectors

In this section, we will consider commutative graded rings A instead of gradedcommutative rings, i.e. graded rings A whose underlying ungraded ring is commutative. We will apply the results of this section to evenly graded, graded-commutative rings or graded, commutative rings over fields of characteristic 2. There does not seem to be an adequate (for our purposes) definition of graded-commutative Witt vectors for graded-commutative rings, nor will it be necessary, in light of Prop. 4.1 below.
Throughout, let p be a fixed prime. For a graded abelian group M and an integer i  0, we write M (i) for the graded abelian group with M (i)n = Mpin.
We assume the reader is familiar with the ungraded theory of p-typical Witt vectors, cf. [Wit37, Haz09, Hes08].

Definition. Let A be a commutative graded ring. As a graded set, the p-typical Witt vectors of A of length 0  n   are defined as

n

n

Wn(A) = A(i), i.e. W (A)j = Ajpi .

i=0

i=0

Just as in the classical case, there is a ghost map

n
w : Wn(A)  A(i)
i=0

given by w(a0, a1, . . . ) = (a0, ap0 + pa1, ap02 + pap1 + p2a2, . . . ).
There is a unique functorial ring structure on Wn(A) making w a homomorphism of graded rings.

If Au denotes A as an ungraded ring then W (Au) and W (A)u are in general distinct:

Example 3.1.

· W (k0[u]) = W (k0)[u] if k0 is a ring concentrated in degree

0 and |u| = d > 0. This is false if d = 0: the (ungraded) p-typical Witt

vectors of W (Fp[x]) are more complicated (cf. [Bor16, Exercise 10]). · W (k0[u±1]) = W (k0)[u±1] in the same situation.

The Verschiebung V : W (A)(1)  W (A) is the map given by V (x0, x1, . . . ) = (0, x0, x1, . . . ); the Teichmüller map is the multiplicative map A  W (A), x  x = (x, 0, 0, . . . ). Furthermore, the Frobenius map is characterized as the unique natural map F : W (A)  W (A)(1) with the property that if w(x) = (w0, w1, . . . )  i A(i) then
w(F (x)) = (w1, w2, . . . )  A(i + 1)
i
The maps V and F restrict to maps V : Wn(A)(1)  Wn+1(A) and F : Wn(A)  Wn-1(A)(1), and we have that F  V = p and F (a) = ap.
Now let k = k0[u±1] be a graded field. Given a graded W (k)-module M and j  0, the abelian group M (j) obtains a W (k)-linear structure  · m = frob()m, where frob is the Frobenius map on W (k), the unique lift of the pth power map on k.

Lemma 3.2. If k = k0[u±1] is perfect with |u| = d > 0 then the functor (1) : M  M (1) is an equivalence, and (l) is a naturally isomorphic with the identity for some l  1.

Proof. Since M (j1)(j2) = M (j1 + j2), it suffices to show the second claim. Since k is perfect, p is a unit in Z/dZ and hence there is a smallest l  1 such that pl  1 (mod d), say pl - 1 = nd. Then the map
Mj  M (l)j = Mjpl ; m  unj m
is a W (k)-linear isomorphism.

Note

that

M

= M (-k)n.

If k = k0, the functor (1) is not an equivalence, but it has a right inverse (-1)

given by

0; p  n M (-1)n = M n ; p | n
p
with the W (k)-linear structure given by .m = frob-1()m. The Frobenius frob is invertible because k = k0 is perfect. Confusingly, (-1) being a right inverse means that M (-1)(1) = M .
In [Fon77, §II.1.5], the group of co-Witt vectors CW (A) is defined for an ungraded ring A, containing the subgroup of unipotent co-Witt vectors CW u(A) = colim(W0(A) -V W1(A) -V · · · ). As a set,









CW (A) = (ai)  A | (. . . , a-r-1, a-r) is a nilpotent ideal for some r  0 ,



i0



and CW u(A) consists of those (ai) with almost all ai = 0.

Proposition 3.3. For a perfect graded field k and a commutative, graded k-algebra A, define the set

CW (A)j =

A(i)  CW (Au),

j

where, as before, Xu denotes the object X with the grading forgotten. Then CW (A) is a W (k)-module such that CW (A)u is a subgroup of CW (Au). It is stable under

the Frobenius and Verschiebung operators, and contains as a submodule
CW u(A) = colim(W0(A) -V W1(A(-1)) -V W2(A(-2)) -V · · · ),
where V : Wn(A) = Wn(A(-1))(1)  Wn+1(A(-1)) is induced by the Verschiebung V : Wn(A)(1)  Wn+1(A).
Note that Wn(A)(-1)  Wn(A(-1)) is an isomorphism iff k = k0[u±1] or A = A0.

Proof. We need to show that the addition in CW (Au) preserves the grading. If Sm  Z[x0, . . . , xm, y0, . . . , ym] denotes the addition polynomial in Wn(A), i.e. such that
(a0, . . . , am) + (b0, . . . , bm) = Sm(a0, . . . , am, b0, . . . , bm),
m
then the addition on CW (Au) is defined in such a way that if (. . . , a-1, a0) + (. . . , b-1, b0) = (. . . , c-1, c0) then
c-n = Sm(a-m-n, . . . , a-n, b-m-n, . . . , b-m)
for m  0, and it is shown in [Fon77, §II.1.5] that this gives a well-defined group structure. Since the polynomials Sm are homogeneous when the variables xi and yi are given degree jpi, the result follows.

3.1. Representability of Witt and co-Witt vectors. Since W (A)j =

 i=0

Ajpi

as sets, this set-valued functors is represented by

(p)j = k[j,0, j,1, . . . ],

where |j,i| = jpi, and W (A), as a graded object, is represented by the bigraded k-algebra p = (p). Each (p)j obtains a Hopf algebra structure by the natural Witt vector addition on W (A)j, and p becomes a Hopf ring (cf. [Wil00]) with a comultiplication

p(A)j 

p(A)j1  p(A)j2 .

j1 +j2 =j

In other words, p represents a graded ring object, even a plethory, in affine schemes. This is a graded version of the p-typical symmetric functions of [BW05,
II.13].
The co-Witt vectors are not representable, but their restriction to algk, i.e. finitedimensional k-algebras, is ind-representable, that is, CWk is a formal group. In the ungraded case, this is described in [Fon77, §II.3­4]. In our graded case, CW (A)j is represented by the profinite ring

(OCWk )j

=

lim k[xj,0, xj,-1, . . . ]/
m,n0

xj,-n, xj,-n-1, . . . , )m

with |xj,i| = jpi, which in the case k = k0 and jpi  Z is to be understood as xj,i = 0. By naturality of the co-Witt vector addition, CWk thus becomes a (graded) formal group.

GRADED p-POLAR RINGS AND THEIR ABELIAN-GROUP VALUED FUNCTORS 11
3.2. Witt vectors of p-polar rings. Observe that the definition of the abelian group of graded Witt vectors makes sense if A merely is a graded p-polar ring. Moreover, if A is a p-polar graded k-algebra, for a commutative graded ring k, then W (A) is a W (k)-module and in fact a p-polar graded W (k)-algebra.
Lemma 3.4. If k is a perfect graded field then the Witt vector functor restricts to
Wn : Pol(j)(k)  Mod(j)(W (k)),
and the Frobenius and Verschiebung operators restrict to Mod(j)(W (k)).
Proof. Obvious from the definition.
Corollary 3.5. Let k be a perfect graded field and A = A(j) a p-typical polar kalgebra with d  j. Denote the regrading equivalence Mod(j)(d)  Mod(1)(ph(j,d) -1) of Cor. 2.11 by . Then
Wn(A) = -1 Wn(hull(A))(1) .
Proof. By the previous lemma, it suffices to consider the case j = 1 and d = ph - 1. The composite A  hull(A)  hull(A)(1) of p-polar algebras is an isomorphism by Cor. 2.13 and hence induces an isomorphism
Wn(A)  Wn(hull(A))  Wn(hull(A)(1)) = Wn(hull(A))(1).
If A is a p-polar k-algebra over a perfect graded field k (the possibility k = k0 is included), we can generalize the ungraded construction of the group of co-Witt vectors [Bau20, Fon77, BC19] to the graded context as follows.
Definition. Let k = k0[u±1] be a perfect graded field of characteristic p and A = A(j) a p-typical polar k-algebra with d = |u|  j.
Define the graded W (k)-module of co-Witt vectors CW (A) by
CW (A) = -1 CW (hull(A))(1) ,
where CW (hull(A)) is defined as in Prop. 3.3. For A = A(j) with d | j, we have that A = A0 k0 k and define CW (A) = CW (A0) W (k0) W (k),
where the ungraded CW (A0) was defined in [Bau20]. For an arbitrary graded p-polar k-algebra A = j A(j), define
CW (A) = CW (A(j)).
j
The submodule CW u(A) is defined in the same way as in Prop. 3.3 and agrees, by Cor. 3.5, with the subset of (. . . , a1, a0)  CW (A) almost all of whose elements are zero.
Note that the Frobenius and Verschiebung operations are well-defined on CW (A) and CW u(A) for A a p-polar k-algebra.

12

TILMAN BAUER

This construction agrees with the one given in [Bau20] when k = k0 and A = A0. If k = k0 with arbitrary commutative graded A, note that for j = 0 almost all factors of

A(i) = Ajpi

j

i0

i0

are zero (namely those where jpi  Z), hence CW (A)j = CW u(A)j for j = 0 and CW (A)0 = CW (A0), in other words, CW (A) = CW u(A) CW u(A0) CW (A0) as abelian groups. Having in mind the as yet unproven Theorem 1.3, this corresponds

to the fact that a connected, graded abelian Hopf algebra must be conilpotent.

Example 3.6. Let k = k0 be perfect of characteristic p and A = k xpi | i  0 the free p-polar algebra on a single generator x in degree 2. Then
Wn(A)2pi = {(a0xpi , a1xpi+1 , . . . , anxpi+n ) | ai  W (k)} = Wn(k)
and Wn(A)j = 0 if j is not twice a power of p. The Verschiebung is given by

V : Wn(A)2pi  Wn+1(A(-1))2pi , (a0, . . . , an)  (0, a0, . . . , an).

Since A0 = 0, we have that CW (A) = CW u(A) = colim(W0(A) -W1 (A(-1)) -··· ) and thus
CW (A)2pi = {(· · · , a-1, a0) | aj  A2pi+j },
which is understood to mean aj = 0 if 2pi+j  Z. Thus CW (A)2pi = Wi(k), and the Frobenius and Verschiebung maps are given by

V : CW (A)2pi  CW (A)2pi-1 the restriction map Wi(k)  Wi-1(k) and

F : CW (A)2pi  CW (A)2pi+1 , the multiplication-by-p map Wi(k)  Wi+1(k).

4. Graded Dieudonné theory
Throughout, let k be a perfect graded field of characteristic p.
Definition. A graded Dieudonné module over k is a graded W (k)-module M together with maps of W (k)-modules
F : M  M (1) and V : M (1)  M
satisfying F V = p and V F = p. We denote the category of Dieudonné modules (with the obvious definition of morphism) by Dmodk.
We call a Dieudonné module M p-adic if for every submodule W (k)-submodule N < M of finite length, the submodule spanned by {V n(N (n)) | n  0} is also of finite length. In other words, M is p-adic if it is a colimit of finite-length W (k)submodules N closed under V in the sense that V (N (1))  N . We call M unipotent if for any finite-length W (k)-submodule N of M , V n(N ) = 0 for n  0. We denote the full subcategories of p-adic and unipotent Dieudonné modules by Dmodpk and DmodVk ,nil, respectively.
Moreover, a Dieudonné module M is called F -profinite if M is profinite as a W (k)-module and has a fundamental system of neighborhoods consisting of W (k)modules N closed under F , i.e. such that F (N ) < N (1). The module M is called connected if the profinite completion of F -1M is trivial and étale if M  F -1M is an isomorphism. Denote the category of F -profinite Dieudonné modules by

GRADED p-POLAR RINGS AND THEIR ABELIAN-GROUP VALUED FUNCTORS 13

D modFk and the full subcategories of connected (resp. étale) Dieudonné modules by D modFk ,c (resp. D modFk ,et).
Now consider the categories AbSchpk resp. Fgpspk. The category AbSchpk is antiequivalent to the full subcategory of bicommutative Hopf algebras H over k such that H = colim H[pn], where H[pn] is the Hopf algebra kernel of the map [pn] : H  H. Similarly, the category Fgpspk is anti-equivalent to the full subcategory of the category of bicommutative complete Hopf algebras consisting of those H such that H = lim coker[pn]. The categories AbSchk and Fgpsk are anti-equivalent by Cartier duality, as are the categories AbSchpk and Fgpspk.
By [Bou96, Prop. A.4], any bicommutative Hopf algebra (and dually, every bi-
commutative complete Hopf algebra) over a field of characteristic p > 2 splits
naturally into an even part and an odd part:

H = He  Ho,
where He is concentrated in even degrees and Ho is an exterior algebra on primitive generators in odd degrees. The functor of primitives gives an equivalence between odd formal groups and oddly graded k-modules inverse to the exterior algebra functor. The odd part carries therefore very little information.
An odd Hopf algebra (or odd formal Hopf algebra) is automatically p-adic because [p] is the trivial map on such Hopf algebras.
This leads us to a simple proof of the odd part of Thm. 1.1:

Proposition 4.1. Let k be a graded field of characteristic p > 2. For a graded
commutative k-algebra A, denote by Fro(A) the odd part of Fr(A), i.e. OFro(A) = (OFr(A))o. Then we have factorizations

Algokp Fro AbSchpk

algokp Fro Fgpspk

(-)o

F^r

and

(Modk )oop ,

(-)o

F^r
(modk )oop ,

where the diagonal map assigns to A the odd part of the underlying k-module A and OF~r(M) = (M ).
Proof. Let H = (M ) be an odd Hopf algebra, where M is some oddly graded k-vector space, and A  Algk. Then
HomModk (M, A) = HomAlgk (H, A) = HomHopfk (H, Cofodd(A)) = HomModl (M, P Cofodd(A)).
Thus P Cofodd(A) = A and thus Cofodd(A) = (A).
We will thus from now on focus only on evenly graded, commutative Hopf algebras (and affine and formal groups). The arbitrarily graded situation in characteristic 2 is completely analogous.
Proposition 4.2. Every formal group G^ splits naturally as G^0 × G^c, where G^0 is étale and G^c is connected. Dually, every bicommutative Hopf algebra H splits as H = Hm  Hu where Hu is unipotent (conilpotent) and Hm is of multiplicative type.

14

TILMAN BAUER

We denote the full subcategory of connected formal groups by Fgpsck and the corresponding full subcategory of unipotent Hopf algebras by Hopfuk .

Proof. In the ungraded context, Fontaine proves this in [Fon77, §I.7]. We give an argument that works in the graded case for the reader's convenience, although no new ideas are needed.
Let A be a finite-dimensional k-algebra. We say that A is étale if it is a (finite) product of (finite) field extensions of k, where a field extension of a graded field k is of course just an inclusion k < k of graded fields. Clearly, A/ nil(A) is étale for any finite k-algebra A.
The formal group G is called connected if OG is a pro-local k-algebra, and it is called étale if OG is pro-étale as a k-algebra.
Define G0 by G0(A) = G(A/ nil(A)) and let Gc be the kernel of G  G0. Then OGc is the pro-local ring having as maximal ideal the kernel of the counit  : OG  k.
We thus get a short exact sequence of formal groups

(4.3)

0  Gc  G  G0  0.

If Ae denotes the maximal étale subalgebra of A, we see that the map

Ae  A  A/ nil(A)

is an isomorphism and OG0 = OG/ nil(OG), so G0 is indeed étale, and the projection map OG  OG0 splits (4.3).

For a graded perfect field k = k0[u±1], the separable (=algebraic) closure is given

by

(For

and

We

will

leave the necessary adjustments in this case to the reader.) We define the Galois

group Gal(k | k) of a field extension k < k to be the group of automorphisms of

k fixing k. Since such a field extension is given by k0[u±1] < k0 [v±1] with u = ve,

we find that

Gal(k | k) = Gal(k0 | k0)  µe(k0 ),

where µe(k0 ) = {  k0 | e = 1} acts by fixing k0 and mapping v to v, and the Galois group Gal(k0 | k0) acts in the natural way on µe(k0 ). We see that k < k is Galois iff k0 < k0 is Galois and k0 contains a primitive eth root of unity. In

particular, the profinite absolute Galois group is

To formulate Galois descent, we will consider 2-functors

C : Sep  Cat

from the category of graded fields of characteristic p and finite, separable field extensions to the 2-category of categories. In particular, for any extension k < k, we obtain an action of Gal(k|k) on C(k). We say that C satisfies Galois descent, and call it a Galois descent category, if the natural map
C(k)  C(k)Gal(k|k)

is an equivalence of categories for every Galois extension k  k in Sep, where C(k)Gal(k|k) denotes the 2-categorical (homotopy) fixed points. This encapsulates the usual definition, as an object in C(k)Gal(k|k) is an object with a Gal(k | k)semilinear action.

GRADED p-POLAR RINGS AND THEIR ABELIAN-GROUP VALUED FUNCTORS 15

Lemma 4.4 (graded Galois descent). The following functors are Galois descent categories, where in each case, i : k  k is a morphism in Sep:
(1) the functor Alg : k  Algk with Alg(i)(A) = A k k; (2) the functor AbSch : k  AbSchekv with AbSch(i)(G) = G ×Spec k Spec k; (3) the functor Fgps defined analogously; (4) the functor Dmod : k  Dmodk with Dmod(i)(M ) = M W (k) W (k).
Each of these categories has an ungraded analog, which we decorate with the letter u, e.g. Algu(k) = {ungraded algebras over k0}. These are not Galois descent categories (over the category of graded fields Sep), but the natural transformations

Algu  Alg, A  A k0 k AbSchu  AbSch,G  G ×Spec k0 Spec k
Fgpsu  Fgps,G  G ×Spec k0 Spec k Dmodu  Dmod,M  M W (k0) W (k),

are equivalences on k = k0[u±1] with |u| = 2.

first part, Note that

let  = 0  any separable

Ce with extension

0 = Gal(k0 | k0) factors as separable

and Ce = extensions

k < K < k, where K = (k)Ce . Explicitly, if k = k0[u±e] and k = k0 [u±1] then

K = k0 [u±e]. For the extension k < K, we have that

A  A k K = A k0 K0 = A k0 k0

induces an equivalence by ungraded Galois descent. For the extension K < k, note

that a Z/deZ-grading is the same as a Z/dZ-grading with an action of the group

Ce, where the degree-di parts can be recovered as the eigenspaces of the Ce-action. For the second part, it suffices to show that Cu(k0)  Ck. Clearly, restriction to
the degree-0 part induces an equivalence Ckev  Cku0 with inverse - k0 k, and this equivalence is compatible with the -action.

Lemma 4.5. Let ModGal(k) be the category of discrete abelian groups with a continuous action of the absolute Galois group Gal(k). Then ModGal : k  ModGal(k) is a Galois descent category equivalent to the category of étale formal groups.
Under this equivalence, formal p-groups correspond to discrete abelian p-groups
with a continuous -action.

Proof. The assignment ModGal becomes a functor by defining i : ModGal(k)  ModGal(k) to be the identity map, restricting the action of Gal(k) to that of Gal(k). This is clearly a Galois descent category since abelian groups with a Gal(k) and a Gal(k | k)-action are the same as abelian groups with a Gal(k)-action.
As in the ungraded context, the equivalence is given by the functors (cf. [Fon77,
§I.7])

Corollary 4.6. We have equivalences of Galois descent categories Fgpsev  ModGal ×(Fgpsc)ev

16

TILMAN BAUER

and Hopfev  ModGal ×(Hopfu)ev

Theorem 4.7. There is an exact natural equivalence Df between the following abelian Galois descent categories:
(1) the category (Fgpsp)ev of even formal p-groups; and (2) the category (D modF )ev of even F -profinite Dieudonné modules.

This natural equivalence is represented by the formal group CWk.

Proof. The statement unwinds to showing that the functor Df represented by CWk from Fgpspk to D modFk is an equivalence, and that Df is compatible with base change in the sense that for any finite, separable extension k of k,

(4.8)

Dfk (G k k) = Dfk(G) W (k) W (k).

This theorem is essentially well-known. An ungraded version appeared in [Fon77,
§III Théorème 1], cf. also [Bau20, Theorem 4.2].
The base change property (4.8) was proved in the ungraded case in [Fon77, Prop. III.2.2]. For any Galois extension k < k with Galois group  and finite
k-algebra A, CW (A k k) = CW (A)

by Galois descent for finite algebras and because  acts componentwise on CW (Ak k)  i0 A k k. If G is a formal group over k then

Dfk(G) = Fgpsk(G, CWk) = {a  CWk(OG) | (a) = a1+1a  CWk(OGkOG)}.

and hence

Dfk (G ×k k) = {a  CWk (OG k k) | (a) = a  1 + 1  a} = Dfk(G).

Equation (4.8) follows from Galois descent for W (k)-modules (Lemma 4.4). This shows that Df is a natural transformation of Galois descent categories. To
show it is an equivalence, we consider two cases: if k = k0 is concentrated in degree 0 then so is W (k), and the classical theorem applies and preserves the grading.
If on the other hand k = k0[u, u-1] with |u| = d, we cannot use the ungraded result directly. By the first part of Lemma 4.4, it suffices to show that Df is an
equivalence after a finite Galois extension, so we may assume d = 2, and by the
second part of the same Lemma, the claim is once again reduced to the ungraded
case.

Proof of the formal case of Thm. 1.3. For an evenly graded, finite-dimensional kalgebra A (arbitrarily graded if p = 2), we have that
Df (Fr(A)) = HomFgpsk (Fr(A), CWk ) = HomFSchk (Spec A, CWk) = CW (A).

Proof of the formal case of Thm. 1.1. By Prop. 4.1, it suffices to consider the case where p = 2 or Frev, the even part of the free formal group functor.
The splitting of Prop. 4.2 gives a splitting of the functor Frev as
Frev = Frev,0 × Frev,c .

GRADED p-POLAR RINGS AND THEIR ABELIAN-GROUP VALUED FUNCTORS 17
The Dieudonné functor restricts to an equivalence between connected formal groups and connected Dieudonné modules, so Thm. 1.3 gives an extension F^rev,c by
F~rev,c(A) = (Df )-1CW (A) c . The same argument would work for étale, p-adic formal groups, but Theorem 1.1 does not require p-adicness. Instead, we observe as in [Bau20, Lemmas 4.3, 4.5] that colimkkk¯ Frev,0(A)(k) = Z HomAlgk (R, k¯) is well-defined for p-polar algebras. By Lemma 4.5, this gives F~rev,0.
We will now turn to the affine case. The analog of Thm. 4.7 is the following:
Theorem 4.9. Let k be a perfect graded field of characteristic p. Then there is an equivalence D between the following Galois descent categories:
(1) The category (AbSchp)ev of p-adic, even group schemes; and (2) the category (Dmodp)ev of p-adic, even Dieudonné modules.
Proof. The equivalence is given by the composition
AbSchpk,ev -d Fgpspk -Df (D modFk )ev -I Dmodpk,ev, where d denotes Cartier duality and I denotes Matlis (Poincaré) duality
M  HomcW (k)(M, CW (k)),
the group of continuous homomorphisms into CW (k). Since both d and I are anti-equivalences and because of Thm. 4.7, D is an equivalence. To see this is an equivalence of Galois descent categories, we need to see that both d and I are. Cartier duality is given by taking linear duals on the level of representing objects, and thus
Homk (H k k, k) = Homk(H, k) = Homk(H, k) k k for finite extension k  k. For Matlis duality, we see that
HomcW (k)(M W (k W (k), CW (k)) = HomcW (k)(M, CW (k) W (k) W (k)) = HomcW (k)(M, CW (k)) W (k) W (k)
since W (k) has finite length as a W (k)-module.
We next study how the free p-adic affine abelian group functors behave with respect to field extensions and Galois descent.
Lemma 4.10. The natural transformation Fr : Alg  AbSch is a natural transformation of Galois descent categories.
Proof. We need to prove that for any finite separable extension k  k of graded fields, Fr(A k k) = Fr(A) ×Spec k Spec k for any graded k-algebra A. Let Fru be the unipotent part and Frm be the part of multiplicative type, corresponding to the connected and the étale parts, respectively, of the Cartier dual formal group.
The unipotent part Fru(A) is represented by the cofree, conilpotent, cocommutative Hopf algebra on A,
Cofu(A) = (Akn)n ,
n0
and since k is flat over k, taking n-fixed points commutes with base change.

18

TILMAN BAUER

The multiplicative part Frm(A) is represented by k¯[(A k k¯)×]. The argument is the same as in [BC19, proof of Thm. 1.3], using graded Galois descent:
Firstly, if k = k¯ and H = k[M ] is a Hopf algebra of multiplicative type, then HomHopfk (H, k[A×]) = Hom(M, A×) = HomAlgk (k[M ], A),
so that the claim holds when k is algebraically closed. Now let k be arbitrary perfect, write A¯ = A k k¯, and let H be a Hopf algebra of multiplicative type with H k k¯ = k¯[M ]. Then
HomHopfk (H, k¯[A¯×]) = HomHopfk¯, (k¯[M ], k[A¯×])
by Lemma 4.4, and the latter group is isomorphic to Hom(M, A¯×) = HomAlgk¯, (k¯[M ], A¯) = HomAlgk (H, A),
again using Lemma 4.4, this time for algebras. Now, if k is a Galois extension of k, we have k¯[A¯×]Gal(k) k k = k¯[A¯×]Gal(k) Gal(k|k) k k = k¯[A¯×]Gal(k),

using Lemma 4.4 once more.
Corollary 4.11. The free p-adic affine group functor Frp : Alg  AbSchp induces a natural transformation of Galois descent categories.
Proof. The functor Frp is just Fr followed by p-completion. By Cor. 4.6 and since unipotent groups are automatically p-complete, it suffices to show that p-completion commutes with separable base change in the opposite category of ModGal. Since p-completion is dual to taking the subgroup of p-power torsion elements in abelian groups, this claim boils down to the obvious statement that restricting group actions and taking p-power torsion elements commutes in abelian groups.

Proof of the affine part of Theorem 1.3. Since for the ungraded Dieudonné functor Du, of the same form as in the statement, this was proved in [Bau20], we will proceed by showing that both the left hand side L(A) = D(Fr(A)) and the right hand side R(A) = CW u(A)(µp (Ak k¯)W (k¯))Gal(k) are natural transformations between the Galois descent categories Alg and Dmod.
For L, this is guaranteed by Lemma 4.10 and Thm. 4.9. For R, it is true for CW u as a subfunctor of CW since CW u(A k k) = CW u(A) as in the proof of Thm. 4.7. For the second factor,

R2(A) =

µp (R k k¯)  W (k¯)

Gal(k)
,

it is almost tautological. Indeed, if k  k is a Galois extension with group , without loss of generality assumed to be a subfield of k¯, then

R2(A k k) =

µp (R k k k k¯)  W (k¯) Gal(k)


= R2(A)

and hence R2(A k k) = R2(A) W (k) W (k) by Galois descent for W (k)-modules. Now if k = k0 is an ungraded field, Theorem 1.3 follows from [Bau20] directly
since the given isomorphism constructed there respects any gradings. If, on the other hand, k = k0[u±1] then we can assume, by the above descent argument, that
|u| = 2.

Remark 4.12. The reader might wonder if Theorem 1.1 cannot be directly derived from the ungraded case using Galois descent technology. The problem is that Polp is not a Galois descent category.

5. Properties and applications

The factorization of the free formal group functor (Thm. 1.1) induces a factor-

ization

(Pro - algk)op

Fr

Fgpsk

pol

F~r

(Pro - polp(k))op,

where the functors denoted by Fr and F~r are the unique extension of the functors from Thm. 1.1 that commute with directed colimits. In this section, we will concentrate on the free unipotent, resp. connected, construction only.
Lemma 5.1. The functor F^rc : (Pro - polp(k))op  Fgpsk commutes with all colimits and has a right adjoint V .
Proof. For the odd part, the functor F^ro factors as
F^ro : (Pro - polp(k))op -U (Pro - modk)oop -F^r AbSchpk
(cf. Prop. 4.1), where U is the forgetful functor. Then an adjoint is given by the composition of the adjoint of F^r (which is the functor of primitives) and an adjoint of U . The latter is the objectwise free p-polar algebra functor, which works because the free p-polar algebra on an odd finite-dimensional k-module is again finite dimensional (it is a sub-p-polar algebra of the exterior algebra).
So we can restrict our attention to even formal groups. For the free connected formal group Frc, it suffices to show that its composition with the Dieudonné equivalence Df commutes with the stated colimits, and by Theorem 1.3, it is therefore enough to show that CWkc : Pro - polp(k)  Dmodk commutes with all limits. But CWkc is a formal group, i.e. representable.
The existence of an adjoint follows from Freyd's special adjoint functor theorem once we show that Pro - polp(k) is complete, well-powered, and possesses a cogenerating set. Any pro-category of a finitely complete category, such as polp(k), is complete, and any pro-category has constant objects as a cogenerating class. Since polp(k) has a small skeleton, the condition on a cogenerating set is satisfied. To see that Pro - polp(k) is well-powered, observe that a subobject S < A for A  Pro - polp(k) is in particular a sub-pro-vector space. By [AM69, Prop. 4.6], a

20

TILMAN BAUER

monomorphism in Pro - Modk can be represented by a levelwise monomorphism. Thus if A : I  Modk represents a pro-finite k-module with # Sub(A(i)) = i for some (finite) cardinals i then # Sub(A)  iI i; in particular, it is a set.
Lemma 5.2. The functor F^ru : Polp(k)op  AbSchuk commutes with all colimits and filtered limits, and has a right adjoint V .

Proof. As in Lemma 5.1, the right adjoint on odd affine groups is given by the
functor of primitives follow by the free p-polar algebra functor, so we will restrict
our attention to even p-adic affine groups. By Theorem 1.3, it suffices to show that the functors CW u : Polp(k)  DmodVk,nil commutes with all limits, which looks wrong until one realizes that limits in DmodVk,nil are not the same as limits in Dmodk.
The functor CW u(A) commutes with finite limits (it is ind-representable), so it
suffices to show it commutes with infinite products. Indeed, the natural map

CW u( Ai)  CW u(Ai)

i

i

is an isomorphism; an element in the right hand side is a set of elements (xi  CW u(Ai)) such that there is an n  0 such that V n(xi) = 0 for all i.
The commutation with filtered colimits is straightforward: CW u commutes with
them because it is a colimits of functors represented by small objects (polarizations
of finitely presented algebras).
For the existence of an adjoint, we apply again the special adjoint functor theo-
rem in the form of [AR94, Thm. 1.66]. The category Polp(k) is locally presentable and the functor D  F^ru, as just shown, is accessible (commutes with -filtered
colimits) and commutes with all limits.

Note that this implies, by taking adjoint functors in Thm. 1.1, that the algebra underlying a unipotent Hopf algebra H is always of the form hull(V (H)), i.e. free over a p-polar k-algebra, and the pro-finite algebra underlying a complete connected Hopf algebra H is always of the form hull(V (H)), i.e. free over a profinite p-polar k-algebra. Of course, this is also a direct corollary of Borel's work on the structure of algebras underlying Hopf algebras [Bor54, MM65] .
Lemma 5.3. Let A be a p-polar k-algebra and H = Cofu(A) the unipotent Hopf algebra representing the p-adic affine group F^ru(A). Then H is isomorphic, as a pointed coalgebra, to the symmetric tensor coalgebra on the k-vector space A.
Proof. The symmetric tensor coalgebra on a vector space V is given by
S(V ) = Si(V ) with Si(V ) = V i i ,
i0
and it is a pointed coalgebra by the inclusion k = S0(V )  S(V ). A pointed coalgebra C is conilpotent if for each x  C, N (x)  C(N+1) maps to 0 in C¯(N+1), where C¯ is the cokernel of the pointing. The coalgebra S(V ) is conilpotent and, indeed, the right adjoint to the forgetful functor U from the category Coalguk of pointed, conilpotent, cocommutative coalgebras to k-vector spaces, mapping a coalgebra C to C¯.

GRADED p-POLAR RINGS AND THEIR ABELIAN-GROUP VALUED FUNCTORS 21

Note that a Hopf algebra is unipotent if and only if its underlying pointed coalgebra is conilpotent. The claim is that the diagram

Polp(k)

2-commutes. By taking left adjoint functors, this is equivalent to the 2-commutativity of the square in the diagram

Polp(k)

Modk U Coalguk .

The free commutative Hopf algebra Sym(C¯), and hence

algebra there is

on C  Coalguk is given by a natural map of k-modules

the symmetric C  Sym(C¯)

given in degree 0 by the augmentation and in degree one by the projection C  C¯.

This map  : U (C)  U1(V (C)) is adjoint to a map  : Fr(U (C))  V (Fr(C)) in Polp(k). To see that this map is an isomorphism, we consider its image under the conservative functor

hull : Polp(k)  Algk .

Since

hull V

:

Hopf

u k

 Algk

is

the

forgetful

functor

and

hull  Fr :

Algk

is the symmetric algebra functor, we see that hull() is the identity on Sym(C).

Corollary 5.4. Let H be a unipotent Hopf algebra which is unipotent cofree on a p-polar k-algebra A. Then A is isomorphic to the vector space of primitive elements PH.
Proof. If H is as in the statement then U2(H) = S(P H) as coalgebras, but by the preceding Lemma, U2(H) = S(U1(A)). Applying the functor P and noting that P (S(M )) = M , we find that P H = U1(A).

Remark 5.5. It is not true that V (H) = P (H) in general, or that P (H) is a p-polar

algebra. Also, if H is a unipotent Hopf algebra whose underlying pointed unipotent

coalgebra is cofree, H is not necessarily cofree over a p-polar k-algebra. For example,

consider the graded Hopf algebra H dual to H = k[x, y] with |x| = j > 0, |y| = p2j,

x primitive and (y) = y 1+1y +

p-1 i=1

1 i!(p-i)!

xpi



xp(p-i).

Then the primitives

P H are dual to the indecomposables Q(H) = x, y , i.e. P H = a, b with |a| = j,

|b| = p2j. Suppose H was cofree, to that P H is a p-polar k-algebra by the corollary

above. For degree reasons, P H cannot carry any but the trivial p-polar algebra structure, P H = a × b . As a right adjoint, Cofu commutes with products and hence Cofu(P H) = Cof( a )  Cof( b ) = (k[x]  k[y]) = H. But H = H as Hopf algebras since P (H) = x, xp, xp2 , . . . , while P ((H)) = x, xp, . . . , y, yp, . . . , a

contradiction.

Proof of Thm. 1.4. Let p = k[j,0, j,1, . . . ] be the Hopf algebra representing the functor of p-typical Witt vectors. Denote by  : p  Cofu(V (p)) the unit of the adjunction. Applying the functor of primitives, since Cofu(V (p)) is cofree as a coalgebra by Lemma 5.3, we obtain a map

P  : P (p)  V (p).

TILMAN BAUER

Now V (p) = pol(j)(p) = k jp,ki | i, k  0 and P (p) = k jp,k0 | k  0 , and P  is the inclusion map. We see that P (p) is in fact a direct factor of V (p) as a
p-polar algebra, with an retraction p : V (p)  P (p) given by

p(j,i) 

j,0 ; 0;

i=0 otherwise

Taking adjoints, we obtain a map of Hopf algebras q : p  Cofu(P p). A map of unipotent Hopf algebras is injective iff it is injective on primitives, and P q : P p  P (Cofi(P p)) = P p is the identity, so q is injective. By dimension considerations, it must also be surjective.
