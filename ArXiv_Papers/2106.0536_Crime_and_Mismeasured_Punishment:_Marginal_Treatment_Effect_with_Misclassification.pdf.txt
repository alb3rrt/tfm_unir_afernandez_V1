Abstract
Using data from criminal cases in the State of S~ao Paulo, Brazil, I analyze whether alternative sentences -- e.g., fines or community services -- decrease recidivism. To do so, I leverage the random assignment of judges within a court district as a source of exogenous variation in the probability of punishment to identify the effect of alternative sentences in comparison to the no-punishment counterfactual. Initially, I show that the usual identification strategy fails to identify the correct treatment effect parameter if it uses the trial judge's sentence, because the trial judge's decision may misclassify the final sentence due to the appeals process. To avoid this measurement error problem, I follow two approaches. First, I propose a novel partial identification strategy to identify the marginal treatment effect (MTE) with a misclassified treatment. This method explores restrictions on the relationship between the misclassified treatment and the correctly measured treatment, and allows for dependence between the instrument and the measurement error. Second, I collect data on Appeals Court's decisions and estimate the MTE based on the correctly measured final sentence. This last exercise is used as a benchmark for the set identification method that I propose.
This draft is preliminary. While its theoretical part is complete, its empirical application is not ready yet.

1 Introduction
Mass incarceration and overcrowded prisons are a severe problem in the U.S. (Wagner and Sawyer, 2018) and in Latin America (Limoncelli et al., 2020). In particular, Brazil has a high prison population rate (357 per 100,000) and high occupancy level for its prisons (151.9%) according to the Institute for Crime and Justice Policy Research (2021). To solve this severe Human Rights issue in Brazil, the NGO Conectas proposed 10 policy changes (Conectas Direitos Humanos, 2017). Their main suggestion is imposing alternatives sentences -- such as fines and community services -- against all crimes whose maximum prison sentence in Brazil is less than 8 years. This policy represents a significant change from the status quo since alternative sentences are currently imposed only against crimes whose maximum prison sentence is less than 4 years.
To evaluate the merit of the proposed policy change, we must measure the impacts of alternative sentences on criminal behavior. In this study, I focus on estimating one dimension of this impact: "Do alternative sentences decrease recidivism?" In other words, if the marginal defendant is punished with fines or community services instead of being acquitted or dismissed, does she decrease her future criminal behavior?
To answer this question, I collect data from all criminal cases brought to the Justice Court System in the State of S~ao Paulo, Brazil, from July 7th 2007 and June 2nd 2020.1 I focus on the criminal cases whose maximum prison sentence is less than 4 years and observe the defendant's full name, the assigned trial judge's full name, the trial judge's full sentence, and the sentence's date. For simplicity, I divide trial judge's sentences in two groups: (i) punished, containing defendants who were fined or sentenced to community services because they were either convicted or signed a non-prosecution agreement, and (ii) not punished, containing defendants who were acquitted or whose cases were dismissed. To measure recidivism, I check whether the defendant's name appears in any criminal case after the trial judge's sentence
1Sa~o Paulo is the largest state in Brazil, with a population above 41 million people according to the Brazilian Census in 2010. Moreover, analyzing the impact of judicial policies on criminal behavior in this state is relevant due to its relatively high criminality. For example, according to Sa~o Paulo Public Safety Secretary, there were 6.48 murders, 878.83 thefts and 490.23 robberies per 100,000 inhabitants in 2020. Importantly, theft is one of the most common crimes in my sample.

date. To address endogenous selection into punishment, I follow Bhuller et al. (2019) and Agan
et al. (2021), and use the trial judge's leave-one-out rate of punishment as an instrument. This variable is independent of the defendant's counterfactual criminal behaviors because trial judge's are randomly assigned to each case conditional on court districts according to state law in S~ao Paulo.
Although standard in the empirical literature, the above identification strategy ignores that the trial judge's sentence may not be equal to the defendant's final sentence if the defendant appeals (Green and Winik, 2010). When the trial judge and the Appeals Court judges disagree between each other, a treatment variable based only on the trial judge's decision misclassifies the true final sentence. Since the treatment variable is binary, the measurement error is negatively correlated with the true treatment value and the usual IV strategies are biased.
To address this misclassification problem while simultaneously accounting for endogenous punishment decisions, I develop a novel partial identification strategy that provides easy-tocompute bounds around the marginal treatment effect (MTE, Heckman and Vytlacil, 1999) of alternative sentences on recidivism. I also collect data on Appeals Court's decisions and compare the results derived from the proposed set identification method against the results derived from the usual IV strategies that use the correctly measured punishment decision based on each case's final sentences.
The marginal treatment effect (MTE) is a function that captures the effect of a treatment for the individual who is indifferent between taking the treatment or not. In my empirical application, the MTE function captures the effect of being punished with an alternative sentence on recidivism for the defendant who is at the margin of being found guilty or not conditional on her judge's leniency levels. By analyzing this treatment effect parameter at different margins of judge's leniency, we may uncover that individuals who would be punished by almost all judges (even very lenient judges) benefit from paying a fine or doing community services while individuals who would be punished only by very strict judges are harmed by
3

their sentences.2 Therefore, understanding the heterogeneity of the impact of alternative sentences is key to understand its benefits and costs. In particular, a policy maker may want to train judges to only use sentencing criteria that reduces recidivism according to the MTE function.3
Following Tamer (2010), my partial identification strategy for the MTE function with a misclassified treatment variable offers a menu of estimates based on three set of assumptions. To derive bounds around the MTE function, these assumptions simultaneously address endogenous selection into treatment and non-classical measurement error. Since these sets gradually add stronger assumptions to tighten the bounds around the MTE function, the researcher can build a menu of estimates and transparently analyze the informational content of each assumption. This type of analyzes is also advocated by Manski (2011), who refers to it as a layered policy analysis.
Four assumptions are common to all sets of assumption used in this paper. First, the instrument is independent from the potential outcomes and the latent heterogeneity variable that defines the true treatment. Second, the instrument is strong, having an impact on the true probability and the mismeasured probability of receiving the treatment. Third, the latent heterogeneity variable that defines the treatment is continuous. Finally, the first moment of the potential outcomes are finite. These assumptions are standard in the literature about instrumental variables as illustrated by Heckman et al. (2006) and are used here to address the problem of endogenous selection into the treatment.
To simultaneously account for misclassification of the treatment variable, I add three increasingly strong assumptions to those four common assumptions.
First, I impose that the impact of the instrument on the true probability of treatment has the same sign of the impact of the instrument on the mismeasured probability of treatment. Using this assumption, I can identify the sign of the MTE function at any point.
2A similar result was found by Bhuller et al. (2019) with respect to the marginal effect of incarceration in Norway.
3Designing this policy would be impossible if the researcher had access only to a single summarizing measure of the distribution of treatment effects such as the average treatment effect, the average treatment effect on the treated or the IV estimand, which is a weighted average of local average treatment effects (Imbens and Angrist, 1994).
4

Second, I impose that the impact of the instrument on the mismeasured probability of treatment is close to the impact of the instrument on the true probability of treatment. Using this assumption, I can bound the magnitude of the MTE function at any point and analyze the sensitivity of these bounds to the degree of misclassification.
Third, I impose a functional relationship between the mismeasured probability of treatment and the true probability of treatment. Using this assumption, I can derive sharp uniform bounds around the MTE function and sharply bound any treatment effect that can be written as a weighted integral of the MTE function, such as the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) and the Average Treatment Effect on the Untreated (ATU).
Besides partially identifying the MTE function of alternative sentences as in my empirical application, the proposed method can be used to analyze important empirical questions in many fields. In Economics of Education, education attainment may be mismeasured (Black et al., 2003; Card, 2001; Kane et al., 1999), implying that, to analyze returns to education, we need to simultaneously address endogenous schooling choices and measurement error as discussed by Acerenza et al. (2021). A similar problem appears when analyzing the effect of welfare programs because recipients endogenously choose to apply for welfare programs and frequently misreport their status due to stigma (Hernandez et al., 2007; Hernandez and Pudney, 2007; Meyer et al., 2015, 2018; Meyer and Mittag, 2019a,b). Estimating the effect of immigration or unionization also requires simultaneously addressing endogenous selection into treatment and misclassification as illustrated by Bernstein et al. (2019) for immigration, and Card (1992) and Bollinger (1996) for unionization. Moreover, with the increasing availability of large data sets, prediction methods are being used to infer the treatment status in a variety of empirical question involving endogeneity problems, as illustrated by Black et al. (2020) and Arellano-Bover (2020).
With respect to its theoretical contribution, this work is inserted in the literature about identification of treatment effect parameters with measurement error. As illustrated by the survey articles by Schennach (2016) and Hu (2017), this literature is vast and growing. This
5

phenomenon is methodologically important since Millimet (2011) finds that measurement error can create severe bias in many estimators that are common in the literature about treatment effect parameters. The studies in this literature differ with respect to four important aspects: whether the true treatment variable is endogenous, whether treatment effects are heterogeneous, which variable is mismeasured (outcome, treatment or instrument), and what is the target parameter.
Similarly to my work, four recent papers focused on identifying treatment effect parameters allowing for heterogeneous effects, endogenous selection into treatment and misclassification of the treatment variable: Ura (2018), Calvi et al. (2019), Tommasi and Zhang (2020) and Acerenza et al. (2021). While the first three papers focus on discrete instruments and the LATE parameter (Imbens and Angrist, 1994), Acerenza et al. (2021) and I focus on continuous instruments and the MTE function. Differently from these four papers, I do not assume that the instrument is independent from the potential misclassified treatment variables nor from the misreporting decision, complementing their analysis with alternative identification assumptions.
Importantly, allowing for co-dependence between the instrument and the misclassified treatment variable is key in my empirical application for two reasons. First, the trial judge's leniency measure (instrument) and her sentence (misclassified treatment) are mechanically connected. Second, extreme trial judges (very strict or very lenient) are likely more frequently over-ruled by the Appeals Court as median trial judges, implying that the instrument is correlated with the measurement error.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the structural model and the misclassification mechanism, and discusses the identifying assumptions. In Section 3, I provide the identification results for the MTE bounds with a misclassified treatment variable under each set of assumptions. Section 4 discusses all the steps that still have to be implemented in my empirical application. All proofs are detailed in Appendix A. Appendices B and C explain two problems generated by misclassification in the MTE framework. In Appendix D, I discuss simple economic models that ensure that the identifying assumption in Section
6

2 hold, while, in Appendix E, I extend my analysis to a binary instrument and the LATE parameter, complementing the work done by Ura (2018) and Calvi et al. (2019). Finally, in Appendix F, I provide details on how to connect the bounds around the MTE function to bounds around common treatment effect parameters.

2 Econometric Framework
In this section, I assume that I do not observe the final judicial decision in each case and develop an econometric method that addresses endogenous selection-into-treatment and misclassification simultaneously. To analyze the Marginal Treatment Effect (MTE) when the treatment variable is mismeasured, I start with the standard generalized selection model (Heckman and Vytlacil, 1999), described in the potential outcome framework:

Y = Y1 · D + Y0 · (1 - D)

(1)

D = 1 {U  PD (Z)}

(2)

where Z is an observable instrumental variable (trial judge's leniency measure) with support given by an open set Z  R, PD : Z  R is an unknown function, U is a latent heterogeneity variable (amount of criminal evidence in favor of the defendant) and D is the correctly measured treatment status (indicator that the defendant received some type of punishment -- non-prosecution agreement or conviction -- in her case's final decision).4 Equation (2) models how the agent self-selects into treatment and imposes monotonicity (Imbens and Angrist, 1994; Vytlacil, 2002). The variable Y is the realized outcome variable (indicator of recidivism), while Y0 and Y1 are the potential outcomes when the agent is untreated and treated, respectively.
I augment this model with the possibly misclassified treatment status indicator T (trial judge's sentence). Note that the binary nature of the treatment variable implies that the measurement error (T - D) is non-classical, i.e., Cov (T - D, D) < 0. The misclassified
4My framework can be adapted to a binary instrument, i.e., Z = {0, 1} . This case, that bounds the LATE parameter, is detailed in Appendix E and complements the work developed by Ura (2018), Calvi et al. (2019), Tommasi and Zhang (2020) and Acerenza et al. (2021).

treatment is relevant because the researcher observes only the vector (Y, T, Z), while Y1, Y0, D and U are latent variables.5
Following Heckman et al. (2006), I impose four assumptions.

Assumption 1 The latent variables (Y0, Y1, U ) are independent of the instrument Z, i.e., Z  (Y0, Y1, U ).
Assumption 1 is an exogeneity assumption and is common in the literature about instrumental variables. In my empirical application, this assumption holds conditional on the court district because, in the State of S~ao Paulo, Brazil, trial judges are randomly assigned to cases within each court district. Moreover, this type of assumption is common in the judge fixed-effect literature (Bhuller et al., 2019; Agan et al., 2021; Norris et al., 2021).

Assumption 2 The derivatives of the function PD and of the mismeasured propensity score

are always different from zero, i.e., dPD (z) = 0 and dPT (z) = 0 for every z  Z, where

dz

dz

PT : Z  R is defined as PT (z) = P [ T = 1| Z = z] for any z  Z.

Assumption 2 is a rank condition, intuitively imposing that the instrument is locally strong
everywhere. Note also that Assumption 2 is stronger than the rank condition usually imposed
in the literature about marginal treatment effects (Heckman et al., 2006, Assumption A-2).
In particular, since the correctly measured treatment variable is not observed, it is impossible to test that dPD (z) = 0 for every z  Z. However, since the mismeasured propensity score
dz is trivially identified, it is possible to test that dPT (z) = 0 for every z  Z. Observe also
dz that Assumption 2 implies that 0 < P [D = 1] < 1, a support condition that is required for any evaluation estimator.

Assumption 3 The distribution of the latent heterogeneity variable U is absolutely continu-
ous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.
5For simplicity, I drop exogenous covariates from the model and assume that there is only one instrument. All results derived in the paper hold conditionally on covariates and with partial derivatives when there is a vector of continuous instrumental variables.

8

Assumption 3 is a regularity condition that allows me to normalize the marginal distribution of U to be the standard uniform. Consequently, I have that the true propensity score P [ D = 1| Z = z] satisfies PD (z) = P [ D = 1| Z = z] for any z  Z. However, due to misclassification of the treatment variable, the propensity score is not identified.

Assumption 4 The expectation of the absolute value of the potential outcomes is finite, i.e., E [|Y0|] <  and E [|Y1|] < .
Assumption 4 is a regularity condition that allows me to apply standard integration theorems and ensures that average treatment effects are well-defined.
Due to measurement error of the treatment variable, Assumptions 1-4 are not sufficient to identify the marginal treatment effect (Proposition 8). To address this problem, I propose a layered policy analysis (Manski, 2011) and gradually impose increasingly strong assumptions that allow me to derive increasingly strong identification results in Section 3. Consequently, I offer a menu of estimates whose credibility can be assessed by each reader based on the plausibility of each assumption (Tamer, 2010). Intuitively, these assumptions restricts the amount of measurement error when comparing D and T by constraining the relationship between D, T and Z.6

Assumption 5 The derivative of the true propensity score has the same sign as the derivative

of the mismeasured propensity score, i.e., sign dPD (Z) = sign dPT (Z) for every z  Z.

dz

dz

Assumption 5 imposes a very weak restriction on the impact of Z on the true treatment

variable D and on the misclassified treatment variable T . Under this assumption, it is possible

to identify the sign of the marginal treatment effect. In my empirical application, it imposes

that tougher trial judges also increase the probability of receiving some type of punishment

according to the last judicial decision in each case.

Assumption 6 The ratio between the derivatives of true propensity score and of the mismea-

dPD (Z)/dz

 , c for a known c  [1, +).

Assumption 6 imposes not only that the impact of Z on the true treatment variable D and on the mismeasured treatment variable T have the same sign, but also that those impacts are not arbitrarily different from each other. Note that using a smaller c imposes a stronger restriction on the relationship between D, T and Z. Under this assumption, it is possible to uniformly bound the marginal treatment effect function. In practice, the researcher may be uncertain about the value of c. After deriving Corollary 10, I explain how to choose the largest value of c that is compatible with the data and the other model assumptions. Alternatively, the researcher can follow a sensitivity analysis strategy (Cinelli and Hazlett, 2019) and present results for different values of c, where c is set equal to the ratio between different percentiles of the distribution of dPT (Z)/dz.

Assumption 7 For a known c  [1, +), a known set A  G × R and an unknown pair

Assumption 7 imposes a restriction on the functional relationship between the true propen-

sity score and the mismeasured propensity score in the sense that it connects the level and all

the derivatives of those two objects. If A = G ×R, then Assumption 7 only adds a invertibility

condition to Assumption 6. An easy-to-interpret version of Assumption 7 imposes that the

mismeasured propensity score is a rescaled version of the true propensity score by defining A := {g  G and g is constant.} × {0}.7 Once more, using a smaller c imposes a stronger

restriction on the relationship between D, T and Z. Under this assumption, it is possible

to derive sharp uniform bounds around the MTE function and to sharply bound a variety of
treatment effect parameters that can be written as a weighted integral of the MTE function.8
7While Assumption 7 in its general form can be seen as high-level condition that is weaker than the restrictions imposed by Acerenza et al. (2021, Section 4), its more intuitive version is more restrictive than the method proposed by Acerenza et al. (2021, Section 4). These authors impose restrictions in the primitives of the model that allow them to write the true propensity score as a linear function of the mismeasured propensity score.
8My definition of sharpness imposes recovery of a derivative of the data distribution instead of recovery of the level of the data distribution. For a more detailed discussion, see Remark 13.

3 Partial Identification of the MTE with a Misclassified Treatment
My goal is to derive partial identification results for the Marginal Treatment Effect as a function of the value of the instrument (MTE function). Formally, I define this object as  : Z  R such that, for any z  Z,
 (z) = E [ Y1 - Y0| U = PD (z)] .
Intuitively, this definition of the MTE function captures the effect of a treatment for the individual who is indifferent between taking the treatment or not, where the margin of indifference is defined by the value of the individual's instrument.
In my empirical application, the MTE function captures the effect of being punished with an alternative sentence on future criminal behavior for the defendant who is at the margin of being found guilty given her judge's leniency levels. Analyzing the MTE function at different margins of judge's leniency is important because being punished may benefit individuals who would be punished by almost all judges (even very lenient judges), but may harm individuals who would be punished only by very strict judges. Consequently, understanding the heterogeneity of the impact of alternative sentences is key to understand its benefits and costs.
Note that, while Heckman and Vytlacil (2005) define the MTE as a function of the latent heterogeneity U , I define the MTE as a function of the instrument. Consequently, different instrumental variables are associated with different MTE functions. Although the function  (·) is not policy-invariant according to the definition of Heckman and Vytlacil (2005), I can still use it to compute interesting policy relevant treatment effect parameters (PRTE). For example, in my empirical application, I can still compute the treatment effect of making all judges as strict or as lenient as the strictest or most lenient judges. Moreover, under Assumption 7, there is a one-to-one map between my definition of the MTE function and its standard definition, allowing me to easily derive bounds around common treatment effect parameters (Corollary 15).
11

To partially identify the MTE function, I, first, analyze the consequences of a misclassified treatment variable on the Local Instrumental Variable (LIV, Chalak, 2017, Heckman et al., 2006) estimand and, then, derive increasingly strong identification results based on Assumptions 5-7.
If the researcher ignores that the treatment variable is misclassified, she can compute the LIV estimand using the misclassified treatment variable T as if it was the actual treatment variable. The next proposition analyzes which object is identified by this naive approach and clarifies two negative consequences of ignoring misclassification.

Proposition 8 (LIV Estimand) Under Assumptions 1-4, the LIV estimand (Chalak, 2017)

satisfies

dPD (z)/dz

f (z) =

·  (z)

(3)

dPT (z)/dz

for

any

z



Z,

where

f:

such

that

Moreover, if Assumptions 1-4 hold and the function PT is invertible, then the LIV estimand

(Heckman et al., 2006) satisfies

dE [ Y | PT (Z) = p] = dPD

dp

dPT

PT-1 (p) /dz ·  PT-1 (p) /dz

PT-1 (p)

(4)

for any p in the support of PT (Z).
Proof. The proof of this proposition follows Heckman et al. (2006) and is detailed in Appendix A.1.
The first negative consequence shown by Proposition 8 is that, when misclassification is ignored, two different definitions for the LIV estimand do not identify the MTE function. Similarly to the comparison between the LATE and the Wald Estimator when the treatment variable is misclassified (Calvi et al., 2019; Tommasi and Zhang, 2020), there is a scaling factor connecting the LIV estimand and the MTE function.
The second negative consequence shown by Proposition 8 is that IV validity tests may fail if misclassification is ignored. For example, when the outcome variable has a compact support,

12

Fradsen et al. (2019, Section 3) proposes to test the monotonicity condition (Equation (2)) by testing whether the function dE [ Y | PT (Z) = p] is bounded between the smallest and the
dp largest possible treatment effects. Proposition 8 shows that this test is not valid when the treatment variable is mismeasured because the scaling factor dPD PT-1 (p) /dz in Equation (4)
dPT PT-1 (p) /dz is possibly unbounded without extra assumptions. A misclassified treatment variable also

renders the monotonicity test proposed by Heckman and Vytlacil (2005, Theorem 1) invalid

as detailed in Appendix B. Moreover, the mismeasured propensity score may not satisfy index

sufficiency as explained in Appendix C.

Furthermore, ignoring misclassification hardens the interpretation of the usual IV esti-

mand. Following Heckman et al. (2006, Section III.B), I can show that the naive IV estimand

satisfies

Cov (Z, Y )

1

= Cov (Z, T )

0

 (u) · E [ Y1 - Y0| U = u] du,

where  (u) = E [ Z - E [Z]| PD (Z)  u] · P [PD (Z)  u] . Unless Cov (Z, T ) = Cov (Z, D), Cov (Z, T )
then the weights  (·) do not integrate to one and the IV estimand do not identify a proper

weighted average of the MTE. Moreover, since Cov (Z, T ) = Cov (Z, D) is equivalent to

Cov (Z, T - D) = 0, this condition intuitively imposes a testable restriction in my empirical

application: extreme trial judges (very strict or very lenient) are as likely to be over-ruled by

the Appeals Court as median trial judges.

Now, to derive increasingly strong identification results for  (·), I add Assumptions 5-7.

The first identification result (Corollary 9) shows that I can identify the sign of the MTE

function under a weak assumption about the signs of the derivatives of the true propensity

score function and of the mismeasured propensity score function.

Corollary 9 (Identifying the sign of the MTE function) Under Assumptions 1-4 and 5, the sign of  (z) is identified for any z  Z.
Proof. In Equation (3), the scaling function that multiplies the MTE function  (·) is strictly positive under Assumptions 2 and 5. Consequently, I have that sign ( (z)) = sign (f (z)) for any z  Z.

13

Knowing the sign of the MTE function  (z) at a point z  Z is important. If the instrument is policy-relevant, this result can be used to ensure that the benefit of every treated person is positive. For example, in my empirical application, the policy maker can reeducate judges' whose conviction rates are related to a positive effect on recidivism to change their conviction criteria to points associated with a negative effect. Even when the instrument is not policy-relevant, knowing whether the MTE function  (·) is mostly positive or negative is useful to evaluate the pros and cons of a treatment.
The second identification result (Corollary 10) shows that, under an assumption about the ratio between the derivatives of the true propensity score function and of the mismeasured propensity score function, I can uniformly bound the MTE function. Moreover, the distance between the true MTE function and any function in this set is bounded above by an identifiable constant under Assumptions 1-4 and 6.

Corollary 10 (Outer Set for the MTE function) Suppose Assumptions 1-4 and 6 hold. I have that   1, where

1 :=

~: Z  R For any z  Z, ~(z) 

1 · |f (z)| , c · |f (z)| .

Moreover, for any ~  1 and d  (0, +],  - ~

Proof. The proof of the first part of Corollary 10 uses Equation (3) and the bounds imposed

dPD (z)/dz

on the ratio

by Assumption 6 to uniformly bound the MTE function, while the

dPT (z)/dz

proof of the second part of Corollary 10 uses the definition of the norm ||·||d. The details are

in Appendix A.2.

Corollary 10 is strictly stronger than Corollary 9 in the sense that not only it identifies

the sign of  (z) at any point z  Z, but also it provides the largest possible effect and the

smallest possible effect for each value of the instrument. If the instrument is policy-relevant,

this result can be used to ensure that the benefit of every treated person is larger than the

cost of treatment. For example, in my empirical application, the policy maker can re-educate

14

judges' whose punishment rates are related to effects that are not large enough to compensate

for punishment costs to change their punishment criteria to points associated with effects that

pass a cost-benefit analysis. Even when the instrument is not policy-relevant, bounding the

MTE function  (·) is useful to know whether most points pass a cost-benefit analysis.

Due to Corollary 10, I can also adapt the test proposed by Fradsen et al. (2019) to test

Assumptions 1-4 and 6 when the support of Y0 and Y1 is bounded. To do so, I check whether sup~1 supzZ ~(z) is smaller than the largest possible effect and whether inf~1 infzZ ~(z) is larger than the smallest possible effect. If that is the case, I do not reject Assumptions 1-4

and 6. Note that this test can be used to define the largest non-falsified value of c  [1, +).

To implement it, find z and z that respectively maximizes and minimizes the function f (·)

1

and, then, find the smallest c that falsifies the model by comparing · f (z), c · f (z), · f (z)

c

c

or c · f (z) against the largest and smallest possible effects.

The third identification result (Corollary 11) derives a more strict uniform bound for the

MTE function under Assumption 7.

Corollary 11 (Outer Set for the MTE Function with Assumption 7) Suppose Assumptions 1-4 and 7 hold. I have that   2, where


      2 := ~: Z  R

in the acceptable MTE functions given the data restrictions. For example, Corollary 10

stills accepts MTE functions that are equal to f (z) times a non-constant scaling factor,

15

while those functions are ruled out in Corollary 11 when A := {g  G and g is constant.} × {0}. Importantly, if f (z) has different signs for different values of z, the upper contour and the lower contour of the bounds in Corollary 10 are not included in the set 2 when A := {g  G and g is constant.} × {0}. As a consequence, treatments that pass a cost-benefit analysis under Corollary 10 may not pass the same analysis under Corollary 11.
Although outer sets -- as the ones described in Corollaries 10 and 11 -- provide reliable information about the true value of the function  (·), it is theoretically interesting to investigate when an outer set exhaust all the information about  (·) based on the data and the model restrictions. Following this line of inquiry, the fourth identification result (Proposition 12) shows that the uniform bound in Corollary 11 is sharp when the outcome variable is binary.

Proposition 12 (Sharp Identified Set for the MTE Function) Suppose Assumptions 14 and 7 hold. In addition, suppose that the outcome variable Y is binary, sup~2 supzZ ~(z)  1 and inf~2 infzZ ~(z)  -1. Then, 2 is the sharp identified set for  in the sense that, for any ~  2, there exist candidate random variables U~ , Y~0, Y~1, D~ and a function
PD~ : Z  [0, 1] such that
1. D~ is monotonic with respect to Z and its index is given by PD~ , i.e.,

D~ = 1 U~  PD~ (Z) ;

(5)

2. Z, U~ , Y~0, Y~1 and PD~ achieve the candidate target parameter, i.e.,

~(z) = E Y~1 - Y~0 U~ = PD~ (z)

(6)

for any z  Z; 3. Z, U~ , Y~0, Y~1 and PD~ satisfy the data restriction given by

dE [ Y | Z = z] = dE Y~ Z = z

(7)

dz

dz

16

for any z  Z, where Y~ = Y~1 · D~ + Y~0 · 1 - D~ ; 4. Y~0 and Y~1 satisfy the support condition given by

Y~0  Y0 = {0, 1} and Y~1  Y1 = {0, 1} ,

(8)

where Y~0, Y0 Y~1 and Y1 are the support of Y~0, Y0, Y~1 and Y1, respectively; 5. Z, U~ , Y~0, Y~1, D~ satisfy Assumptions 1-4 and Assumption 7. Proof. To prove that the set 2 is the sharp identified set for , I construct, for each ~  2, the candidate random variables that satisfy the five restrictions of Proposition 12. The details of this proof are in Appendix A.3.

Remark 13 Since the definition of sharpness in Proposition 12 does not ensure that the data Z, Y~ generated by the candidate random variables U~ , Y~0, Y~1, D~ has the same distribution
of the data (Z, Y ) that is generated by the true latent variables (U, Y0, Y1, D), it is weaker than the definition of sharpness proposed by Canay and Shaikh (2017). However, my definition still uses all the restrictions (Equation (7)) directly imposed by the data on the MTE function in the case of binary variables.

Remark 14 Assuming that the outcome variable Y is binary is not restrictive. If Y is a continuous variable, I can analyze the dummy variable 1 {Y  y} for any y  R and derive point-wise sharp bounds for the distributional marginal treatment effect function.
Corollary 11 and Proposition 12 are useful because they provide easy-to-derive bounds for any treatment effect parameter that can be written as a weighted integral of the marginal treatment effect. Corollary 15 summarizes this result. In Appendix F, I provide explicit formulas for the weights associated with the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), the Average Treatment Effect on the Untreated (ATU) and any Policy Relevant Treatment Effect (PRTE, Heckman and Vytlacil, 2001).

Corollary 15 (Bounds on Treatment Effects Parameters) Suppose Assumption 1-4 and 7 hold. Define a treatment effect parameter T E as

1
T E :=  PD-1 (u) ·  (u, PD) du,
0

where  : [0, 1] × RR  R is a weighting function. Then, the treatment effect parameter T E is bounded by

1

inf (a,~b,PD~ ,~)A~ 0

~ PD-~ 1 (u) ·  u, PD~ du  T E
1

 sup (a,~b,PD~ ,~)A~ 0

~ PD-~ 1 (u) ·  u, PD~ du;





  

a, ~b, PD~ , ~

 A × {g :

such

that

where A~ :=

  

PD~ (z) =

z a (z~) · dPT (z~) dz~ + ~b and ~(z) = 1 · f (z) for any z  Z

-

dz

a (z)

.
  

If, additionally, the outcome variable Y is binary, sup~2 supzZ ~(z)  1 and inf~2 infzZ ~(z) 

-1, then the above bounds are sharp in the sense defined in Proposition 12.

Proof. Note that, under Assumption 7,  PD-1 (u) = E [ Y1 - Y0| U = u], implying that Corollary 15 is a direct consequence of Corollary 11 and Proposition 12.
Corollary 15 illustrates the unifying force of the marginal treatment effect: identification results about the MTE function can be easily extended to many interesting treatment effects. Consequently, bounding the MTE function offers a flexible and off-the-shelf tool to answer many research questions that rely on other treatment effect parameters. For numeric convenience, I also rewrite Corollary 15 imposing that A := {g  G and g is constant.} × {0} in Appendix F.
Moreover, when interest lies exclusively on an uni-dimensional treatment effect parameter (e.g., the ATE or some PRTE), Corollary 15 can be used to implement the breakdown analysis proposed by Kline and Santos (2013), Masten and Poirier (2018) and Masten and Poirier (2019). To do so, it is necessary that some desired conclusion (e.g., ATE is positive) holds

18

when c = 1. Then, I increase the value of c  [1, +) in Assumption 7 until the desired conclusion ceases to hold for some values in the identified set of the parameter of interest. This value of c that starts breaking down the desired conclusion is known as the breakdown point.
4 Further Work
Although the theoretical part of this paper is ready, the empirical application is, at this point, only the motivation for the econometric method proposed here and still needs to be fully implemented. Using data from all criminal cases brought to the Justice Court System in the State of S~ao Paulo, Brazil, from July 7th 2007 and June 2nd 2020, I want to answer whether alternative sentences decrease recidivism. To do so, I will use three approaches.
Approach 1 Using the correctly measured treatment variable (final sentence in each case), I will point-estimate the true MTE (Heckman and Vytlacil, 2005) using the standard Local Instrumental Variable (LIV) approach as discussed by Andresen (2018) and Zhou and Xie (2020). I will also implement all the specification and robustness test that are commonly used in the judge fixed effects literature as discussed by Bhuller et al. (2019) and Agan et al. (2021). Moreover, I will implement tests of instrument validity that focus on the MTE, such as the methods proposed by Fradsen et al. (2019) and Mao and Sant'anna (2020). The results based on this approach will be my main empirical results and offer a benchmark for the other two approaches.
Approach 2 Using the misclassified treatment variable (trial judge's sentence in each case), I will implement the same estimators and tests that were used in Approach 1. By comparing the results based on this approach and the results based on Approach 1, this exercise will illustrate the bias generated by a misclassified treatment variable in an empirical context focused on the MTE function.
Approach 3 Using the misclassified treatment variable (trial judge's sentence in each case), I will implement the partial identification strategy proposed in Sections 2 and 3. By comparing
19

the estimated bounds with the point-estimates found in Approach 1, this exercise will
illustrate the usefulness of set identification when the treatment variable is misclassified.

A Proofs of the main results A.1 Proof of Proposition 8
First, I prove Equation (3).9 Fix z  Z arbitrarily. Note that

E [ Y | Z = z] = E [ Y1 · D + Y0 · (1 - D)| Z = z]

= E [ Y0| Z = z] + E [ (Y1 - Y0) · D| Z = z]

= E [Y0] + E [ (Y1 - Y0) · D| Z = z]

= E [Y0] + E [ (Y1 - Y0) · 1 {U  PD (Z)}| Z = z]

= E [Y0] + E [ (Y1 - Y0) · 1 {U  PD (z)}| Z = z]

= E [Y0] + E [(Y1 - Y0) · 1 {U  PD (z)}]

A.3 Proof of Proposition 12

The proof is by construction. For each ~  2, I define the density of the candidate random variables U~ , Y~0, Y~1, D~ to ensure that they satisfy the five restrictions of Proposition

12.

Fix ~  2 arbitrarily. By definition, there exist a, ~b  A such that P~D~ := Z  [0, 1] is

invertible, PD~ (z) =

Step 1. Note that, by definition, Assumption 7 holds for PD~ .

Observe also that dPD~ (z) dz

=

a (z) · dPT (z) for any z  Z, implying that Assumption 2 holds.

dz

Step 2. Define U~  U nif orm [0, 1] and D~ := 1 U~  PD~ (Z) , ensuring that Assumption 3 and Equation (5) hold.

Step 3. Since fZ,U~,Y~0,Y~1 = fZ · f U~|Z · P Y~0 = ·, Y~1 = · U~ , Z , I define the joint density function of Z, U~ , Y~0, Y~1 through its components fZ , f U~|Z and P Y~0 = ·, Y~1 = · U~ , Z . Fix (z, u, y0, y1)  R2 × {0, 1}2 arbitrarily.

(a) Note that fZ is identified. Consequently, fZ is defined according to the data.
(b) Define f U~|Z ( u| z) = fU~ (u) and P Y~0 = y0, Y~1 = y1 U~ = u, Z = z = P Y~0 = y0, Y~1 = y1 U~ = u , ensuring that Assumption 1 holds. Consequently, I only have to define fU~ (u) and P Y~0 = y0, Y~1 = y1 U~ = u .
(c) Note that fU~ is defined in Step 2. (d) I impose P Y~0 = y0, Y~1 = y1 U~ = u = P Y~0 = y0 U~ = u ·P Y~1 = y1 U~ = u for
simplicity. Define P Y~0 = 0 U~ = u = 1-P Y~0 = 1 U~ = u and P Y~1 = 0 U~ = u = 1 - P Y~1 = 1 U~ = u . Consequently, I only have to define P Y~0 = 1 U~ = u and P Y~1 = 1 U~ = u .

26

(e) Define the set U := u~  R| u~ = PD~ (z) for some z  Z  [0, 1]. (f) If u / U , P Y~0 = 1 U~ = u = 0 and P Y~1 = 1 U~ = u = 0. (g) From now on, suppose that u  U. Define
P Y~0 = 1 U~ = u = -~ PD-~ 1 (u) · 1 ~ PD-~ 1 (u) < 0
and P Y~1 = 1 U~ = u = ~ PD-~ 1 (u) · 1 ~ PD-~ 1 (u)  0 .
Step 4. Note that Y~0 and Y~1 satisfy Assumption 4 and Equation (8). Step 5. Observe that, for any z  Z,
E Y~1 - Y~0 U = PD~ (z) = P Y~1 = 1 U~ = PD~ (z) - P Y~0 = 1 U~ = PD~ (z) = ~ PD-~ 1 PD~ (z) · 1 ~ PD-~ 1 PD~ (z)  0 - -~ PD-~ 1 PD~ (z) · 1 ~ PD-~ 1 PD~ (z) < 0 = ~(z) ,

ensuring that Equation (6) holds.

Step 6. Note that, for any z  Z,

dE Y~ Z = z = dPD~ (z) · ~(z)

dz

= a (z) · dPT (z) · ~(z) dz

by Step 1 by definition by Equation (3),

B Incorrect Rejection of the Generalized Roy Model
Without measurement error, Heckman and Vytlacil (2005, Theorem 1) derive testable implications of Equations (1) and (2) and Assumptions 1-4. For example, they show that E [ D · g (Y )| PD (Z) = p] is an increasing function of p, where g : R  R+. However, when using the mismeasured treatment variable and the mismeasured propensity score, this testable restriction of the model may not hold when naively using the mismeasured treatment variable and propensity score in place of the correctly measured ones. To show this result, I find a joint distribution for (T, D, Y0, Y1, U, Z) such that Equations (1) and (2) and Assumptions 1-4 hold and E [ T · g (Y )| PT (Z) = p] is not an increasing function of p.
Let Z  U nif orm [0, 1], U  U nif orm [0, 1], Y0  Bernouille (1/5) and Y1  Bernouille (4/5) be mutually independent random variables. Define g : R  R+ such that g(y) = y for any y  R, D := 1 {U  Z} and T := 1 {U  1 - 2 · Z}. Note that PD (z) = z and PT (z) = 1-2·z for any z  [0, 1/2]. Observe that

E [ T · Y | PT (Z) = 1/2] - E [ T · Y | PT (Z) = 1/3]

= E [ T · Y | Z = 1/4] - E [ T · Y | Z = 1/3]

= E [ T · (D · Y1 + (1 - D) · Y0)| Z = 1/4] - E [ T · (D · Y1 + (1 - D) · Y0)| Z = 1/3]

= E [ T · Y0| Z = 1/4] + E [ T · D · (Y1 - Y0)| Z = 1/4]

- E [ T · Y0| Z = 1/3] - E [ T · D · (Y1 - Y0)| Z = 1/3]

= E [ 1 {U  1 - 2 · Z} · Y0| Z = 1/4] + E [ 1 {U  1 - 2 · Z} · 1 {U  Z} · (Y1 - Y0)| Z = 1/4]

- E [ 1 {U  1 - 2 · Z} · Y0| Z = 1/3] - E [ 1 {U  1 - 2 · Z} · 1 {U  Z} · (Y1 - Y0)| Z = 1/3]

= E [1 {U  1 - 2 · 1/4} · Y0] + E [1 {U  1 - 2 · 1/4} · 1 {U  1/4} · (Y1 - Y0)]

- E [1 {U  1 - 2 · 1/3} · Y0] - E [1 {U  1 - 2 · 1/3} · 1 {U  1/3} · (Y1 - Y0)]

C Failure of Index Sufficiency
Without measurement error, Heckman et al. (2006) shows that the propensity score satisfy index sufficiency, i.e., E [ Y | Z = z] = E [ Y | PD (Z) = p] for any z  Z and p  [0, 1] such that p = PD (z). However, the mismeasured propensity score may not satisfy this property. To prove this result, I find a joint distribution for (T, D, Y0, Y1, U, Z) such that Equations (1) and (2) and Assumptions 1-4 hold and E [ Y | Z = z] = E [ Y | PT (Z) = p] for some z  Z and p  [0, 1] such that p = PT (z).
Let Z  U nif orm [0, 1], U  U nif orm [0, 1], Y0  N (0, 1) and Y1  N (1, 1) be mutually independent random variables. Define D := 1 {U  Z} and T := 1 U  4 · Z2 - 4 · Z + 1 . Note that PD (z) = z and PT (z) = 4 · z2 - 4 · z + 1 for any z  [0, 1]. Observe that PT (0) = 1, PT (1) = 1,
E [ Y | Z = 1] = E [ Y | PD (Z) = 1] = E [Y1] = 1
and

E [ Y | PT (Z) = 1] = E [ Y | Z  {0, 1}]

= E [ Y | Z = 0] · P [ Z = 0| Z  {0, 1}] + E [ Y | Z = 1] · P [ Z = 1| Z  {0, 1}]

= E [Y0] + E [Y1]

D Simple Sufficient Conditions for Assumptions 5-7
In this appendix, I state simple sufficient conditions that, when combined with Equations (1)-(2) and Assumptions 1-4, ensure that Assumptions 5-7 hold. Moreover, these conditions are stated with specific empirical contexts to illustrate the broad applicability of my theoretical framework to many applied problems. At the end, I follow Tommasi and Zhang (2020) and propose alternative theoretical restrictions that imply Assumption 5.
D.1 Assumption 5: Repeated Decision Making
In this subsection, I analyze two problems when agents with similar behavior have to take the same decision at two points in time and new information is acquired between those two time periods.
D.1.1 Collecting New Evidence in a Criminal Case Let UT be the amount of evidence in favor of the defendant when the trial judge is making
their decision and U be the amount of evidence in favor of the defendant in the Appeals Court. I assume that either the district attorney or the defendant's lawyers can collect new evidence between the trial judge's decision and the Appeals judge's analysis, and I define V := U - UT as the new evidence that was collected. Moreover, I assume that the trial judge and the Appeals judge are equally strict, i.e., their sentences only differ because of the new evidence.10 Mathematically, I write that
D := 1 {U  PD (Z)}
and T := 1 {UT  PD (Z)} = 1 {U - V  PD (Z)} .
10Assuming that two judges are equally strict is plausible. For example, consider the case when the defendant is arrested before the trial and is sent to prison while awaiting trial. In Brazil, if a lawyer petitions the court for a writ of habeas corpus multiple times and brings new evidence each time, the same trial judge will analyze each petition.
30

Assuming that Z  (UT , U ) and denoting FUT as the distribution function of UT and fUT as the density function of UT , I can show that, for any z  Z,

PT (z) := P [ T = 1| Z = z] = FUT (PD (z)) ,

implying, by the chain rule, that

dPT (z) dz

=

fUT

(PD

(z)) ·

dPD (z) . dz

Consequently, Assumption 5 holds because a density function is always positive. Moreover, Assumption 6 may hold depending on the distribution of UT .

D.1.2 Collecting New Information about a Project's Profitability
Suppose that an entrepreneur wants to borrow from the bank to execute a project and talks to her account manager every time she needs a loan. In this context, UT is information about the project's profitability when the entrepreneur talks to her account manager for the first time, U is information about the project's profitability when she talks to her account manager for the second time, Z is the account's manager willingness to lend, T is whether the entrepreneur got a loan the first time and D is whether the entrepreneur got a loan the second time. Assumption 5 holds in this context under the same assumptions explained in Appendix D.1.1.

D.2 Assumption 6: Random Miscoding
Black et al. (2003) documents that schooling is measured with error in the American Census and in the Current Population Survey (CPS). Assume that, similarly to Carneiro et al. (2011), I want to identify the marginal treatment effect of college attendance (D) on wages. To account for measurement error in the treatment variable, I assume that all errors are due to individual inattention when filling the survey questionnaire, i.e., the individual checked the wrong box by mistake. Formally, I assume that the individual's answer to the

31

question "Have you ever attended college?" (T ) is given by

T = 1 {V  0.95} · D + 1 {V > 0.95} · (1 - D) ,

where V  U nif orm [0, 1] captures the individual attention and V  (Z, D). Note that, in this case, 5% of the individuals check the wrong box due to inattention. Observe also that, for any z  Z,

PT (z) := P [ T = 1| Z = z] = P [ T = 1| Z = z, D = 1] · P [ D = 1| Z = z] + P [ T = 1| Z = z, D = 0] · P [ D = 0| Z = z] = 0.95 · PD (z) + 0.05 · (1 - PD (z)) = 0.05 + 0.9 · PD (z) ,

dPD (z)/dz 10

10

implying that

= . Consequently, Assumption 6 holds for c = .

dPT (z)/dz

D.3 Assumption 7: Misreporting due to Stigma
Hernandez and Pudney (2007) documents that welfare participation is measured with error. Assume that I want to evaluate the marginal treatment effect of welfare participation on children's health outcomes. Since people are likely to lie about welfare participation because of social stigma, I assume that the measurement error is unidirectional, i.e., the person will truthfully report no participation (T = 0) if they do not receive welfare benefits (D = 0), but the person may report participation (T = 1) or no participation (T = 0) if they receive welfare benefits (D = 1). Formally, I assume that

T = 1 {V  0.95} · D,

where V  U nif orm [0, 1] captures how much the individual cares about others' opinions and

V  (Z, D). In this case, I have that, for any z  Z, PT (z) = 0.95 · PD (z), implying that,

100

if PT

is invertible, then Assumption 7 holds for c =

, b = 0 and  (z) = c for any z  Z. 95

32

Moreover, if PT is not invertible, then Assumption 7 cannot hold in this context.
D.4 Assumption 7: Dynamic Setting
In Appendix D.3, I show that Assumption 7 holds if T = 1 {V  0.95}·D, V  U nif orm [0, 1], V  (Z, D) and PT is invertible. In this subsection, I provide two dynamic examples that fit into the same framework.
D.4.1 Eviction Order and Execution Humphries et al. (2019, Appendix B) discuss the effect of an eviction order when, after the
judge's decision, the sheriff may or may not execute the order. In this case, there are three counterfactual outcomes: Y0 is the outcome of interest when there is no eviction order; Y1 is the outcome of interest when there is a eviction order, but the sheriff does not execute the order; and Y2 is the outcome of interest when there is a eviction order and the sheriff executes the order. Let D denote the eviction order and T denote the execution of the eviction order. Consequently, the observed outcome variable is given by Y = Y0 · (1 - D) + Y1 · D · (1 - T ) + Y2 · D · T .
For simplicity, I assume that the sheriff's execution does not matter to the individual, i.e., Y1 = Y2. Consequently, the treatment variable of interest is D, as defined by Humphries et al. (2019). However, I decide to erroneously use T as my treatment variable. As Figure D.1a makes clear, the measurement error in this problem is similar to the one described in Appendix D.3, i.e., D = 0 is always correctly measured, but D = 1 may be mismeasured. As a consequence, Assumption 7 holds in this dynamic setting under the same assumptions described in Appendix D.3.
D.4.2 Returns to High School Education Assume that I want to compare the wages of three types of individuals: Y0 is the coun-
terfactual wage of an agent with 11 years of education; Y1 is the counterfactual wage of an agent with 12 years of education and no high school diploma; and Y2 is the counterfactual
33

Figure D.1: Examples: Dynamic Setting

wage of an agent with 12 years of education and a high school diploma. Let D denote whether the person has 12 (D = 1) or 11 years of education and T denote whether the person has a high school diploma (T = 1) or not. Consequently, the observed outcome variable is given by Y = Y0 · (1 - D) + Y1 · D · (1 - T ) + Y2 · D · T .
Following the empirical evidence gathered by Clark and Martorell (2014), I assume that having a high school diploma has no effect, Y1 = Y2. Consequently, the treatment variable of interest is D. However, I decide to erroneously use T as my treatment variable. As Figure D.1b makes clear, the measurement error in this problem is similar to the one described in Appendix D.3, i.e., D = 0 is always correctly measured, but D = 1 may be mismeasured. As a consequence, Assumption 7 holds in this dynamic setting under the same assumptions described in Appendix D.3.
D.5 Assumption 5: General Restrictions from Tommasi and Zhang (2020)
In this subsection, I adapt to the MTE framework two assumptions that were used by Tommasi and Zhang (2020) to analyze the LATE parameter. Proposition D.3 shows that these two extra assumptions are sufficient conditions for Assumption 5.
Assumption D.1 The instrumental variable is independent from the measurement error conditional on the latent heterogeneity, i.e., Z  T | U, D.
34

Assumption D.2 The misclassified treatment variable is an informative proxy about the true treatment conditional on the latent heterogeneity, i.e., P [ T = 1| U = u, D = 1] > P [ T = 1| U = u, D = 0] for any u  [0, 1].
Proposition D.3 If Assumptions 1-4, D.1 and D.2 hold, then Assumption 5 holds. Proof. Fix z  Z arbitrarily. Note that

PT (z) = P [ T = 1| Z = z] by definition

= P [ T = 1| Z = z, U = u] dF U|Z ( u| z) by the LIE

Since (P [ T = 1| U = PD (z) , D = 1] - P [ T = 1| U = PD (z) , D = 0]) > 0 by Assumption D.2, we have that Assumption 5 holds.

35

E Partial Identification of the LATE Parameter
In this Appendix, I adapt my framework in Section 2 and my results in Section 3 to the binary instrument case, complementing the work developed by Ura (2018) and Calvi et al. (2019). To analyze the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) when the treatment variable is mismeasured, I start with the standard generalized selection model (Heckman and Vytlacil, 1999), which is equivalent to the model in Imbens and Angrist (1994) according to Vytlacil (2002).

Y = Y1 · D + Y0 · (1 - D) D = 1 {U  PD (Z)}

(E.1) (E.2)

where Z is an observable binary instrumental variable with support given by Z  {0, 1}, PD : Z  R is a unknown function, U is a latent heterogeneity variable and D is the correctly measured treatment. The variable Y is the realized outcome variable, while Y0 and Y1 are the potential outcomes when the agent is untreated and treated, respectively.
I augment this model with the possibly mismeasured treatment status indicator, T . The mismeasured treatment is relevant because the researcher observes only the vector (Y, T, Z), while Y1, Y0, D and U are latent variables.
I use the following assumptions in order to derive my partial identification results.
Assumption E.1 Z  (Y0, Y1, U )
Assumption E.2 The minimal required rank assumption is

T := P [ T = 1| Z = 1] - P [ T = 1| Z = 0] = 0 and D := P [ D = 1| Z = 1] - P [ D = 1| Z = 0] = 0.

36

However, for ease of notation, I impose

T := P [ T = 1| Z = 1] - P [ T = 1| Z = 0] = 0 and D := P [ D = 1| Z = 1] - P [ D = 1| Z = 0] > 0.
Assumption E.3 The distribution of the latent heterogeneity variable U is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.

Assumption E.7 For a known c  0, , there exists an unknown   , c such that

PD (z) =  · PT (z), where p := max {PT (0) , PT (1)} = PT (1).

My goal is to derive partial identification results for the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) given by  := E [ Y1 - Y0| U  [PD (0) , PD (1)]] . To achieve this goal, I, first, analyze the consequences of a mismeasured treatment variable on the Wald estimand (Imbens and Angrist, 1994) and, then, derive increasingly strong identification results based on Assumptions E.5-E.7.
If the researcher ignores that the treatment variable is mismeasured, she can compute the Wald estimand using the mismeasured treatment variable T as if it was the actual treatment variable. The next proposition analyzes which object is identified by this naive approach.

Proposition E.8 (Wald Estimand) Under Assumptions E.1-E.4, the Wald estimand (Cha-

lak, 2017) satisfies

Y D = · ,
T T

(E.3)

where Y := E [ Y | Z = 1] - E [ Y | Z = 0].

Proof. The proof of this proposition follows directly from Imbens and Angrist (1994).

37

Proposition E.8 shows that, when measurement error is ignored, the Wald estimand does not identify the LATE parameter. This result is discussed in depth by Ura (2018) and Calvi et al. (2019).
Now, adding Assumptions E.5-E.7, I derive increasingly strong identification results for the LATE parameter.

Proposition E.11 (Sharp Identified Set for the LATE Parameter) Suppose Assumptions E.1-E.4 and E.7 hold. In addition, suppose that the outcome variable Y is binary and that B  [-1, 1]. Then, B is the sharp identified set for  in the sense that, for any ~  B, there exist candidate random variables U~ , Y~0, Y~1, D~ and a function PD~ : Z  [0, 1] such that
1. D~ is monotonic with respect to Z and its index is given by PD~ , i.e.,

D~ = 1 U~  PD~ (Z) ;

(E.4)

38

2. Z, U~ , Y~0, Y~1 and PD~ achieve the candidate target parameter, i.e., ~ = E Y~1 - Y~0 U  PD~ (0) , PD~ (1) ;

(E.5)

3. Z, U~ , Y~0, Y~1 and PD~ satisfy the data restriction given by Y = D~ · ~,

(E.6)

where D~ := P D~ = 1 Z = 1 - P D~ = 1 Z = 0 ; 4. Y~0 and Y~1 satisfy the support condition given by

Y~0  Y0 = {0, 1} and Y~1  Y1 = {0, 1} ,

(E.7)

where Y~0, Y0 Y~1 and Y1 are the support of Y~0, Y0, Y~1 and Y1, respectively;

5. Z, U~ , Y~0, Y~1, D~ satisfy Assumptions E.1-E.4 and Assumption E.7.

Proof. The proof is by construction. For each ~  B, I define the density of the candidate

random variables U~ , Y~0, Y~1, D~ to ensure that they satisfy the five restrictions of Proposition

E.11.

Fix ~  B arbitrarily. By definition, there exists a

Step 2. Define U~  U nif orm [0, 1] and D~ := 1 U~  PD~ (Z) , ensuring that Assumption E.3 and Equation (E.4) hold.

39

Step 3. Note that

D~ · ~ = a · T · ~ 1 Y

implying that Equation (E.6) holds.
Step 4. Since fZ,U~,Y~0,Y~1 = P [Z = ·]·f U~|Z ·P Y~0 = ·, Y~1 = · U~ , Z , I define the joint density function of Z, U~ , Y~0, Y~1 through its components P [Z = ·], f U~|Z and P Y~0 = ·, Y~1 = · U~ , Z . Fix (z, u, y0, y1)  {0, 1} × R × {0, 1}2 arbitrarily.
(a) Note that P [Z = ·] is identified. Consequently, P [Z = ·] is defined according to the data.
(b) Define f U~|Z ( u| z) = fU~ (u) and P Y~0 = y0, Y~1 = y1 U~ = u, Z = z = P Y~0 = y0, Y~1 = y1 U~ = u , ensuring that Assumption E.1 holds. Consequently, I only have to define fU~ (u) and P Y~0 = y0, Y~1 = y1 U~ = u .
(c) Note that fU~ is defined in Step 2. (d) I impose P Y~0 = y0, Y~1 = y1 U~ = u = P Y~0 = y0 U~ = u ·P Y~1 = y1 U~ = u for
simplicity. Define P Y~0 = 0 U~ = u = 1-P Y~0 = 1 U~ = u and P Y~1 = 0 U~ = u = 1 - P Y~1 = 1 U~ = u . Consequently, I only have to define P Y~0 = 1 U~ = u and P Y~1 = 1 U~ = u . (e) Define the set U := PD~ (0) , PD~ (1)  [0, 1]. (f) If u / U , P Y~0 = 1 U~ = u = 0 and P Y~1 = 1 U~ = u = 0. (g) From now on, suppose that u  U. Define
P Y~0 = 1 U~ = u = -~ · 1 ~ < 0

and P Y~1 = 1 U~ = u = ~ · 1 ~ > 0 .
40

Step 5. Note that Y~0 and Y~1 satisfy Assumption E.4 and Equation (E.7). Step 6. Observe that E Y~1 - Y~0 U  PD~ (0) , PD~ (1) = ~, ensuring that Equation (E.5) holds.

F Details on Corollary 15
In this appendix, I provide explicit formulas for the weighting functions  associated with the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), the Average Treatment Effect on the Untreated (ATU) and any Policy Relevant Treatment Effect (PRTE, Heckman and Vytlacil, 2001).11 I also derive numerically easy-to-compute bounds around these treatment effect parameters by imposing that the mismeasured propensity score function is a re-scaled version of the true propensity score.
According to Heckman and Vytlacil (2005, Tables IA and IB), we can write the AT E := E [Y1 - Y0], the AT T := E [ Y1 - Y0| D = 1], the AT U := E [ Y1 - Y0| D = 0] and any PRTE using the following weighting functions:

AT E (u, PD) = 1

AT T

FPD (u) - E [PD (Z)]

=

FP  (u) - E [PD (Z)]

FPD -E

,

where u  [0, 1] and P  is the probability of receiving the treatment under an alternative policy regime.
To derive easy-to-compute bounds around these treatment effect parameters, I strengthen Assumption 7 in the following way:

1

Assumption F.1 The function PT is invertible and, for a known c 

1, p

, there exists an

1

unknown  

,c c

such that PD (z) =  · PT (z), where p := supzZ PT (z).

Note that this assumption imposes that the mismeasured propensity score function is a re-

scaled version of the true propensity score. Mathematically, it implies that A = {g  G and g is constant.}×
11For other treatment effect parameters that can be defined as weighted integrals of the MTE function, see Heckman and Vytlacil (2005) and Mogstad et al. (2018).
