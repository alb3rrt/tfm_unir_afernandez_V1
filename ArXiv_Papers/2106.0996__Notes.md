## Abstract

Geographically weighted regression (GWR) models handle geographical dependence through a spatially varying coefficient model and have been widely used in applied science, but its Bayesian extension is unclear because it involves a weighted log-likelihood which does not imply a probability distribution on data. We present a Bayesian GWR model and show that its essence is dealing with partial misspecification of the model. Current modularized Bayesian inference methods accommodate partial misspecification from single component of the model. We extend these methods to handle partial misspecification in more than one component of the model, as required for our Bayesian GWR model. Information from the various spatial locations is manipulated via a geographically weighted kernel and the optimal manipulation is chosen according to a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We justify the model via an information risk minimization approach and show the consistency of the proposed estimator in terms of a geographically weighted KL divergence.
