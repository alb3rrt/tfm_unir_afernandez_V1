Global Regularity for Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes Systems
Fizay-Noah Lee
ABSTRACT. We consider electrodiffusion of ions in fluids, described by the Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes system, in three dimensional bounded domains, with blocking (no-flux) boundary conditions for the ionic concentrations and Robin boundary conditions for the electric potential, representing the presence of an electrical double layer. We prove global existence of strong solutions for arbitrary initial data in the case of two oppositely charged ionic species and also in the case of more than two species when the diffusivities are equal and the magnitudes of the valences are also equal. This result holds unconditionally in the case where fluid flow is described by the Stokes equations. In the case of Navier-Stokes coupling, the result holds conditionally on Navier-Stokes regularity. We also consider a case of mixed blocking-Dirichlet boundary conditions for the ionic concentrations and prove global regularity for two oppositely charged species when the total concentration of one species is sufficiently low.

1. Introduction

We study the Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes (NPNS) system in a connected, bounded domain   R3 with smooth boundary, which models the electrodiffusion of ions in a fluid in the presence of boundaries. The ions diffuse under the influence of their own concentration gradients and are transported by the fluid and an electric field, which is generated by the local charge density and an externally applied potential. The fluid is forced by the electrical force exerted by the ionic charges. The time evolution of the ionic concentrations is determined by the Nernst-Planck equations,

tci + u · ci = Didiv (ci + zici), i = 1, ..., m

(1)

coupled to the Poisson equation

m

-  = zici = 

(2)

i=1

and to the Navier-Stokes system,

tu + u · u - u + p = -K, div u = 0

(3)

or to the Stokes system

tu - u + p = -K, div u = 0.

(4)

In this latter case we refer to the system as the Nernst-Planck-Stokes (NPS) system.
The function ci is the local ionic concentration of the i-th species, u is the fluid velocity, p is the pressure,  is a rescaled electrical potential, and  is the local charge density. The constant zi  R is the ionic valence of the i-th species. The constants Di > 0 are the ionic diffusivities, and  > 0 is a rescaled dielectric permittivity of the solvent, and it is proportional to the square of the Debye length D, which is the characteristic length scale of the electrical double layer in a solvent [18]. The constant K > 0 is a coupling constant given by the product of Boltzmann's constant kB and the temperature TK. Finally,  > 0 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. The dimensional counterparts of  and  are given by (kBTK /e) and e, respectively, where e is elementary charge.
For the ionic concentrations ci we consider blocking (no-flux) boundary conditions,

(nci(x, t) + zici(x, t)n(x, t))| = 0

where n is the outward normal derivative along . This boundary condition represents a surface that is impermeable to the i-th ionic species. For regular enough solutions, blocking boundary conditions imply that the total concentration  ci dx is conserved as can formally be seen by integrating (1) over . For ci, we also consider selective (Dirichlet) boundary conditions,

ci(x, t)| = i > 0,

(6)

which, in electrochemistry [10, 20], represents an ion-selective (permselective) membrane that maintains a fixed concentration of ions.
The boundary conditions for the Navier-Stokes (or Stokes) equations are no-slip,

u(x, t)| = 0.

(7)

The boundary conditions for  are inhomogeneous Robin,

(n(x, t) +  (x, t))| = (x).

(8)

This boundary condition represents the presence of an electrical double layer at the interface of a solvent and a surface [17, 18]. The Robin boundary conditions are derived based on the fact that the double layer has the effect of a plate capacitor. The constant  > 0 represents the capacitance of the double layer, and  :   R is a smooth function that represents an externally applied potential on the boundary (see also [4, 11, 12, 14] where the same boundary conditions are used in similar contexts).
In this paper, we discuss the question of global regularity of solutions of NPNS or NPS in three dimensional bounded, connected domains with smooth boundary. The NPNS system is a semilinear parabolic system, and in general, such systems can blow up in finite time. For example, The Keller-Segel equations, which share some common features with NPNS (e.g. the dissipative structure, Section 3.1), are known to admit solutions that blow up in finite time, even in two dimensions, for large initial conditions [1]. The NPNS system includes the Navier-Stokes equations, where the question of global regularity, as is well known, is unresolved [6]. So for NPNS, we cannot expect at this stage to obtain affirmative results on unconditional global regularity. However, global regularity in three dimensions for the NPS system or even the NernstPlanck equations, not coupled to fluid flow, is still an open problem except in some special cases.
In both the physical and mathematical literature, many different boundary conditions are considered for the concentrations ci and the electric potential , all with different physical meanings. The choice of boundary conditions makes a large difference not only when it comes to determining global regularity, but also in characterizing long time behavior. Global existence and stability of solutions to the uncoupled Nernst-Planck equations is obtained in [2, 3, 5, 12] for blocking boundary conditions in two dimensions. The full NPNS system is discussed in [22] where the electric potential is treated as a superposition of an internal potential, determined by the charge density  and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, and an external, prescribed potential. In this case global weak solutions are obtained in both two and three dimensions. The case of blocking and selective (Dirichlet) boundary conditions for the concentrations and Dirichlet boundary conditions for the potential are considered in [7] for two dimensions, and the authors obtain global existence of strong solutions and, in the case of blocking or uniformly selective boundary conditions, unconditional stability. In [8], these results are extended to three dimensions, for initial conditions that are small perturbations of the steady states. In [4, 11] the authors consider blocking boundary conditions for ci and Robin boundary conditions for , as we do in this paper, and obtain global regularity and stability in two dimensions and global weak solutions in three dimensions. In [9] global regularity in three dimensions is obtained in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions for both the concentrations and the potential. In [15], the authors establish global existence of weak solutions in the case of no boundaries, R3.
As established and used effectively in the works referred to in the previous paragraph, the NPNS system, equipped with blocking or uniformly selective (cf. [7]) boundary conditions for ci, comes with a dissipative structure (Section 3.1), which in particular leads to stable asymptotic behaviors. Deviations from blocking or uniformly selective boundary conditions are known to lead in general to instabilities as verified experimentally, numerically, and rigorously based on simplified models [10, 16, 19, 21, 23]. Such deviations refer

3
to the presence of ion-selective membranes i.e. boundary segments on which the boundary condition for ci is selective.
In light of these observations, it may come as somewhat of a surprise that in three dimensions, large data global regularity has been established in this unstable regime of selective boundary conditions [9], whereas for blocking or uniformly selective boundary conditions, only nonlinear stability results are currently available [8]. Our first main result of this paper (Theorem 2) is to show that, in three dimensions, for two oppositely charged ionic species with blocking boundary conditions, we do in fact have large data global regularity for NPS and NPNS (conditionally on regularity of Navier-Stokes in the latter case) if we impose Robin boundary conditions for the potential , instead of Dirichlet boundary conditions.
Our second main result (Theorem 3) extends this global regularity result to the case of more than two ionic species when the diffusivities and magnitudes of ionic valences are equal (D1 = ... = Dm, |z1| = ... = |zm|) (see also [9]).
For our third and last main result (Theorem 4) we return to a two-species setting and establish a small data global regularity result for a case of mixed boundary conditions, where the anion c2 is imposed with blocking boundary conditions and the cation c1 is imposed with constant selective boundary conditions. Only the initial total concentration of the anion,  c2(x, 0) dx, is required to be small.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the relevant function spaces and state a local existence theorem, the proof of which we omit but can be found in the references provided. In Sections 3-5, we prove the three main results described above.

2. Preliminaries

We are concerned with global existence of strong solutions of NPNS and NPS. To define what we mean

by a strong solution, we first introduce the relevant function spaces.

We denote by Lp() = Lp and W m,p() = W m,p the standard Lebesgue spaces and Sobolev spaces,

respectively. In the case p = 2, we denote W m,2 = Hm() = Hm. We also consider Lebesgue spaces

on the boundary : Lp(). In this latter case, we always indicate the underlying domain  to avoid

ambiguity. We also denote Lpt Lqx = Lp(0, T ; Lq()), Lpt Wxm,q = Lp(0, T ; W m,q()), where the time T is

made clear from context.

Denoting V = {f  (Cc())3 | div f = 0}, the spaces H  (L2())3 and V  (H1())3 are the closures of V in (L2())3 and (H1())3, respectively. The space V is endowed with the Dirichlet norm

f

2 V

=

 |f |2 dx.

In order to avoid having to explicitly deal with the pressure term in the Navier-Stokes and Stokes equa-

tions, we sometimes work with the equations projected onto the space of divergence free vector fields via the Leray projector P : L2()3  H,

tu + B(u, u) + Au = -KP()

(9)

tu + Au = -KP()

(10)

where A = -P : D(A)  H, D(A) = H2()3  V is the Stokes operator, and B(u, u) = P(u · u) (see [6] for related theory).

DEFINITION 1. We say that (ci, , u) is a strong solution of NPNS (1),(2),(3) or of NPS (1),(2),(4) with boundary conditions (5) (or (6)),(7),(8) on the time interval [0, T ] if ci  0, ci  L(0, T ; H1)  L2(0, T ; H2), u  L(0, T ; V )  L2(0, T ; D(A)) and (ci, , u) solve the equations in the sense of distributions and satisfy the boundary conditions in the sense of traces.

The NPNS/NPS system is a semilinear parabolic system and local existence and uniqueness of strong solutions have been established by many authors for many different sets of boundary conditions. We refer the reader to [4] where local well-posedness is established for dimensions greater than one, arbitrarily many ionic species, blocking boundary conditions for ci, and Robin boundary conditions for . However, as the authors remark, the proof, based on methods of maximal Lp regularity, can be adapted in a straightforward

4

FIZAY-NOAH LEE

manner for different boundary conditions, including the selective boundary conditions for ci considered here. Thus we have the following local existence theorem:
THEOREM 1. For initial conditions 0  ci(0)  H1, u(0)  V , there exists T0 > 0 depending on ci(0) H1 , u(0) V , the boundary data ,  (and i if (6) is considered), the parameters of the problem Di, zi, , , K, and the domain  such that NPNS (1),(2),(3) (and NPS (1),(2),(4)) has a unique strong solution (ci, , u) on the time interval [0, T0] satisfying the boundary conditions (5) (or (6)),(7),(8).
REMARK 1. We stress that the nonnegativity of ci is included in our definition of a strong solution. That nonnegativity is propagated from nonnegative initial conditions ci(0)  0 is not self-evident. Its proof is included in the proof of local well-posedness in [4] (see also [7]).
Henceforth, all occurrences of the constant C > 0, with no subscript, refer to a constant depending only on the parameters of the system, the boundary data, and the domain , and this constant may differ from line to line. For brevity, when a constant, other than C, is said to depend on the parameters of the system, we mean this to also include boundary data and the domain.

3. Global Regularity for Blocking Boundary Conditions (Two Species)

In this section we consider the NPNS and NPS systems for two (m = 2) oppositely charged (z1 > 0 > z2) ionic species, both satisfying blocking boundary conditions. In this setting, we prove global existence of strong solutions for the NPS system and the same result, conditional on Navier-Stokes regularity, for the NPNS system.
We begin by proving some a priori bounds that are used for the proof of the global regularity result of this section. We prove some of the estimates in more generality (two or more species) so as to invoke them in Section 4 as well. In Sections 4 and 5, for the sake of brevity and fewer repetitive computations, we shall also frequently make references to some estimates from this section that may not hold verbatim but nonetheless hold up to some minor modifications.

3.1. Dissipation Estimate. The NPNS and NPS systems come with a dissipative structure when blocking boundary conditions for ci and Robin boundary conditions for  are considered. We prove the following proposition:

PROPOSITION 1. Let (ci, , u) be a strong solution of NPNS or NPS on the time interval [0, T ], satisfying boundary conditions (5),(7),(8). Then the functional

for t  [0, T ], where

and µi is the electrochemical potential,

µi = log ci + zi.

(14)

In particular, V (t) is nonincreasing in time.

PROOF. First we note that (1) can be written

tci + u · ci = Didiv (ciµi).

(15)

Then we multiply (15) by µi and integrate by parts. This part is somewhat formal as we cannot exclude the possibility that ci attains the value 0, in which case log ci becomes undefined. Thus, to make this rigorous,

5

we can work instead with the quantity µi = log(ci + ) + zi and later pass to the limit   0, as done in [4]. For conciseness, we stick to the formal computations involving µi. On the right hand side of (15), we
obtain after summing in i,

m

- Di ci|µi|2 dx.

(16)

i=1



which is precisely -D. For the terms on the left hand side, we have after summing in i,

m i=1

In the second line, we used the fact that ci(t) L1 = ci(0) L1 for all time due to blocking boundary conditions. We also used the Poisson equation for . In the fourth line, we used the Robin boundary
conditions (8).
Lastly, for the advective term we obtain after summing,

m

where in the second and third lines we integrated by parts and used the fact that div u = 0. Collecting what we have so far, we have

(19)

Next we multiply (3) (or (4)) by u and integrate by parts, noticing that the integral corresponding to the nonlinear term for Navier-Stokes vanishes due to the divergence-free condition,

(20)

Thus, multiplying (20) by K-1 and adding it to (19), we obtain the conclusion of the proposition.

3.2. Uniform L2 Estimate. Using the dissipative estimate from the previous subsection, we obtain uniform in time control of ci L2 in the case of two oppositely charged species satisfying blocking boundary conditions.

PROPOSITION 2. Let (ci, , u) be a strong solution of NPNS or NPS for two oppositely charged species (m = 2, z1 > 0 > z2) on the time interval [0, T ], satisfying boundary conditions (5),(7),(8). Then there exists a constant M2 > 0 independent of time, depending only on the parameters of the system and the initial conditions such that for each i

sup ci(t) L2 < M2.

(24)

We recall that ci L1 remains constant in time, and by Poincare´'s inequality,  H1() is controlled by  L2 and the boundary data (8). Thus recalling Proposition 1, we conclude  H1 is also uniformly bounded in time. Thus choosing

Here, Cb depends on supt (t) H1 , ci(0) L1 along with the various parameters of the system. Next we use a Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality to bound

and (21) follows.

3.3. Higher Order Estimates. Now we bootstrap the dissipative and L2 estimates to obtain some higher order estimates.

PROPOSITION 3. Let (ci, , u) be a strong solution of NPNS or NPS on the time interval [0, T ] with ci(0)  L, satisfying boundary conditions (5),(7),(8). Assume that for each i, ci satisfies a uniform in time L2 bound,

ci(t) L2 < M2.

(30)

Then there exist constants M, M2 > 0 independent of time, depending only on the parameters of the system, the initial conditions and M2 such that for each i

REMARK 2. For two oppositely charged species, m = 2, z1 > 0 > z2, the hypothesis (30) holds due to Proposition 2.

PROOF. It follows from (2), (30) and elliptic regularity that for some constants P6, P independent of time, we have,

(37)

Now we deduce the uniform in time L bounds, using a Moser-type iteration (see also [4, 5, 8, 22]). For k = 2, 3, 4..., we multiply (1) by ci2k-1 and integrate by parts to obtain

for a constant MT depending on the parameters of the system, the initial conditions, T , and U (T ).

PROOF. We prove the a priori estimates (56)-(58), which together with the bounds on u, (33) and (34), and the local existence theorem allow us to uniquely extend a local solution to a global one by virtue of the fact that the strong norms in Definition 1 do not blow up before time T .
Due to (31), it follows from elliptic regularity that

(t) W 1,  P

for all t, where P depends only on the parameters of the system and uniform Lp bounds on . Next, in order to obtain estimates for ci, we note that the auxiliary variable

c~i = ciezi

(60)

satisfies

tc~i + u · c~i = Dic~i - Dizic~i ·  + zi((t + u · ))c~i

(61)

together with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions

4. Global Regularity for Blocking Boundary Conditions (Multiple Species)

The results of Sections 3.1 and 3.3 hold for more than two species, m > 2. Therefore the question of

whether or not we can extend our global regularity result to a multiple species setting boils down to whether or not we can establish the uniform L2 estimates from Section 3.2 in our current setting. Once such a bound

is established, the proof of global regularity for multiple species follows exactly as in the proof of Theorem

2.

In the proof of Proposition 2 of Section 3.2, specifically in (26), we use the fact that, due to the assumption of two species and z1 > 0 > z2,

(z12c21 - z22c22) = (|z1|c1 - |z2|c2)(|z1|c1 + |z2|c2) = 2(|z1|c1 + |z2|c2)  0.

(78)

Even for the simplest extension of taking 3 species, with z1, z2 > 0 > z3, the corresponding leftmost term in (78) is (z12c21 + z22c22 - z32c23), and in general this term need not be nonnegative. Due to this fact, an analogous proof does not work for more than two species. However, there is one special multiple species

setting where we do have global regularity: namely if all the diffusivities are equal D1 = ... = Dm and all the valences have the same magnitude (e.g. z1 = z2 = 1 = -z3) (see also [9]). Indeed, we have the
following theorem,

THEOREM 3. For initial conditions 0  ci(0)  H1  L (i = 1, ..., m), u(0)  V and for all T > 0, if D1 = ... = Dm = D for a common value D and |z1| = ... = |zm| = z for a common value z, then NPS (1),(2),(4) has a unique strong solution (ci, , u) on the time interval [0, T ] satisfying the boundary conditions (5),(7),(8). For NPNS (1),(2),(3), under the same hypotheses, a unique strong solution on [0, T ]
satisfying the initial and boundary conditions exists provided

T

u(s)

4 V

ds < .

(79)

0

Moreover, in the case of NPS, the solution satisfies the bounds (31),(32),(33),(56),(57) for each i. In the

case of NPNS, the solution satisfies the bounds (31),(32),(34),(58) for each i.

PROOF. We only prove the result corresponding to Proposition 2. As discussed at the beginning of this
section, the other results leading to the proof of global regularity extend naturally from Section 3. This special case of multiple species effectively boils down to a two species setting. The variables  and
 = z(c1 + c2 + ... + cm)  0 satisfy

t + u ·  = Ddiv ( + z)

(80)

t + u ·  = Ddiv ( + z)

(81)

and boundary conditions

(n + zn)| = (n + zn)| = 0.

(82)

Multiplying (80) and (81) by  and  respectively and integrating by parts, we obtain

(89)

where R is a constant that depends on uniform bounds on  H1,  L1 and  L1 , along with the parameters of the system. Thus by applying Poincare´ inequalities to  L2 and  L2 as in (27), we conclude after a Gro¨nwall estimate on (89) that  L2 and  L2 remain uniformly bounded in time. In particular, because ci are nonnegative, it follows from the boundedness of  L2 that ci L2 are uniformly bounded in time for each i. This result replaces Proposition 2.

5. Global Regularity for Mixed Boundary Conditions

In this section, we again consider NPNS and NPS for two oppositely charged species. Suppose  represents a cation selective membrane which allows for permeation of cations but blocks anions. As previously mentioned, ion selectivity is typically modelled by Dirichlet boundary conditions. So in this case, the boundary conditions for ci, assuming z1 > 0 > z2, are

c1(x, t)| =1 > 0

(90)

(nc2(x, t) + z2c2(x, t)n(x, t))| =0

(91)

where 1 is constant. The boundary conditions for  and u are unchanged (see (7),(8)). As briefly discussed in the introduction, such configurations are known, in general, to lead to electroki-
netic instabilities whereby, for large enough voltage drops sup  - inf , one starts seeing vortical flow
patterns, and for even larger drops, even chaotic behavior, resembling fluid turbulence and reminiscent of
thermal turbulence in Rayleigh-Be´nard convection [10].
To prove global regularity in this mixed setting, we aim to obtain a priori control of the growth of the strong norms, which characterize strong solutions, namely ci  L t Hx1  L2t Hx2, u  L t V  L2t Hx2. At this stage, it is unclear whether such control is possible for arbitrarily large initial data. However, we
prove below that it is possible if we assume that the anion (i = 2) concentration is sufficiently low i.e. if c2(0) L1 is sufficiently small. This smallness condition is needed to obtain L t L2x bounds for ci in the spirit of Proposition 2.

PROPOSITION 4. Let (ci, , u) be a strong solution of NPNS (1),(2),(3) or NPS (1),(2),(4) for two
oppositely charged species (m = 2, z1 > 0 > z2) on the time interval [0, T ] satisfying boundary conditions (90),(91),(7),(8). Then there exists a constant ic > 0 depending only on the parameters such that the following holds: if c2(0) L1  ic, then there exist M~2, m~ 2 > 0 depending on the parameters of the system and the initial conditions such that for each i = 1, 2

sup ci(t) L2 < M~ 2em~ 2T = M2(T ).

(113)

This completes the proof of the proposition.

As in the case of blocking boundary conditions, the L2 bounds obtained in the previous proposition are sufficient, in the mixed boundary conditions setting, to obtain control of ci in the space L t Hx1L2t Hx2. Since the L2 bound (92) is time dependent, all higher regularity bounds are also time dependent. In particular,
even for NPS, no time independent bounds of the type (57) are available.

THEOREM 4. For initial conditions 0  ci(0)  H1, u(0)  V with c2(0)  ic (Proposition 4) and for all T > 0, NPS (1),(2),(4) for two oppositely charged species (m = 2, z1 > 0 > z2) has a unique strong solution (ci, , u) on the time interval [0, T ] satisfying the boundary conditions (90),(91),(7),(8). Under the same hypotheses, NPNS (1),(2),(3) for two oppositely charged species has a unique strong solution on [0, T ]
satisfying the initial and boundary conditions provided

REMARK 3. We remark that, from a modelling point of view, one of the main hypotheses in the derivation
of the Nernst-Planck-Poisson (1), (2) model is the treatment of ions as point charges, and this simplification is justified for sufficiently dilute solutions [17]. Thus, requiring the total concentration c2(0) L1 to be small is at least self-consistent.

PROOF. As in the proofs of Theorems 2 and 3, global existence of strong solutions follows from the

local existence theorem and the a priori bounds (115)-(118). Step 1. L t L4x bounds for ci. L t Wx1, bounds for . L t V  L2t Hx2 bounds for u. From (92) and
elliptic regularity, we obtain as in (36),

 L6  P6(T )

(119)

This, together with (122), allows us to conclude that there exists a time dependent constant M4(T ) such that

for each i,

ci L4  M4(T ).

(125)

Furthermore, since W 2,4  W 1,, we have for a time dependent constant P(T ),

 W 1,  P(T ).

(126)

At this point, we have established enough bounds to mimic the derivations of (51), (53) to obtain the bounds

(116), (118) for u. Step 2. L t Hx1  L2t Hx2 bounds for c1. Now we bound derivatives of c1. First we multiply (107) by

for a time dependent constant C(T ). Using a Gro¨nwall estimate, from (128), we obtain (117) for c1 in the
case of NPNS. In the case of NPS, (128) together with (116) gives us (115) for c1. Step 3. L t Hx1  L2t Hx2 bounds for c2. To obtain the corresponding bounds for c2, we start with (63),
which holds verbatim for i = 2:

As for the term I3 = I31 + I32 (see (66)), we note that

Then recalling that we already have the bounds (115), (117) for c1, we obtain as in (74), using the embedding

H1  L6,

t L6  Ct(T, U (T ))( c~2 L2 + c~1 L2 + u V + 1)

(135)

for a time dependent constant Ct(T, U (T )) depending also on U (T ) (though in the case of NPS, this latter dependence is redundant). Thus we bound I32 as in (75),

|I32|

It is straightforward to verify using the chain rule that

c~1 L2  CP (T )( c1 L2 + c1 L2 + c1 L2 + c1 L2 )

(138)

for a time dependent constant CP (T ) depending on P(T ). So, by the previously established bounds (115), (117) for c1 (cf. (128)), together with (125), we have

(139)

Then from (137), a Gro¨nwall estimate together with (139) gives us (117) for i = 2 in the case of NPNS,
after we convert back to the variable c2. In the case of NPS, (116) together with (137) and (139) gives us (115) for i = 2. This completes the proof.

Appendix A. Trace Inequalities

LEMMA 1. Let   R3 be an open, bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary. Then for p  [2, 4], we have the embedding H1()  Lp(). Moreover, for p  [2, 4], there exist constants Cp, Cp depending
only on  and p such that

(140)

In particular, for p = 4, there exists a constant c4 depending only on  such that

f L4()  c4 f H1().

(141)

And, for p  [2, 4) and any  > 0 there exists C depending on , p and  such that

PROOF. The proof is based on the proof of Theorem 1.5.1.10 in [13]. Because C1(¯ ) is dense in H1(), we assume without loss of generality that f  C1(¯ ). Next we use the fact (Lemma 1.5.1.9, [13]) that for bounded Lipschitz domains   R3, there exists µ  (C(¯ ))3 and a constant  > 0 such that µ · n   almost everywhere on , where n is the outward pointing normal vector on . Then, on one hand, we have

|f |p · µ dx = p |f |p-2f f · µ dx.





On the other hand, integrating by parts, we have

(143)

|f |p · µ dx = |f |pµ · n dS - |f |pdiv µ dx.







(144)

Therefore,

 |f |p dS  |f |pµ · n dS





=p |f |p-2f f · µ dx + |f |pdiv µ dx





(145)

p µ L() |f |p-1|f | dx + div µ L() |f |p dx





p µ L() f

div µ L() f

where the last line follows from a Ho¨lder inequality. Then, (140) follows from taking both sides of (145) to the p-1 power. Taking p = 4 in (140) we have

(146)

so (141) follows from the embedding H1()  L6(). Lastly, (142) follows from (140) by interpolating the spaces L2(p-1)() and Lp() between L1() and H1(), followed by Young's inequalities.
