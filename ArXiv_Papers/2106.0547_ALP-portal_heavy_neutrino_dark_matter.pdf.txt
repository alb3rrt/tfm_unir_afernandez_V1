Axion like particles(ALPs) and right handed neutrinos (RHNs) are two wellmotivated dark matter(DM) candidates. However, these two particles have a completely different origin. Axion was proposed to solve the Strong CP problem, whereas RHNs were introduced to explain light neutrino masses through seesaw mechanisms. We study the case of ALP portal RHN DM taking into account existing constraints on ALPs. We consider the leading effective operators mediating interactions between the ALP and SM particles and three RHNs to generate light neutrino masses through type-I seesaw. Further, ALP-RHN neutrino coupling is introduced to generalize the model which is restricted by the relic density and indirect detection constraint.
1. INTRODUCTION
Dark matter is one of the most important issues of modern particle physics and cosmology. Although a wide variety of experiments ranging from sub-galactic scale to a large cluster of galaxies have accumulated data in support of DM's existence [1­5], its microscopic properties still remain unknown. Several DM candidates have been proposed and searched for, however, no completely satisfactory DM candidate has been found so far. Among a lot of possibilities, the axion and sterile neutrinos can be regarded as a leading candidates for DM. These particle arises in well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model and have very rich phenomenology.
It is known from the cosmological observations that the sum of the active neutrino masses m  0.12 eV [6, 7] and contribution to the relic density  4.5 × 10-3, which is too low to explain the DM abundances today, hence there is no explanation for DM within the SM. However, a new heavier neutrino field could explain DM and it is naturally required

to explain the masses of active neutrinos as inferred from the oscillation experiments [8]. The discovery of neutrino oscillations confirming the existence of at least two non-vanishing neutrino mass-squared differences necessitate physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). In principle neutrino mass could be simply generated by addition of right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) to the SM particle content. These RHNs interact with SM fields via mixing with active neutrinos. Since RHNs are SM singlet, they allow Majorana mass term along with usual Dirac mass term. This is known as type-I seesaw mechanism [9­12]. Mass of these RHNs could range from eV to GUT scale depending on the models [13­16]. RHNs can also play the role of warm dark matter(WDM), which is singlet under the SM gauge symmetry and has tiny mixing with the SM neutrinos leading to a long lifetime [17, 18]. Also, KeV scale RHNs has been studied as a viable DM candidate [19­21]. In this work we have instead focused on the prospects of having GeV scale RHNs as a Weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) DM candidate.
Axion [22] was postulated in the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism to solve the strong CP problem [23­25] of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This axion can be identified as a (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of the U (1)PQ global symmetry [26, 27]. This QCD axion gets a tiny mass from the explicit breaking of this global symmetry due to QCD anomaly. Astrophysical and experimental searches have not favoured the PQ model. To resolve issues with PQ model, other popular solutions like KSVZ [28, 29], DFSZ [30] etc. invoking axion were also proposed and studied afterwards. The magnitude of the couplings of axions to ordinary matter is inversely proportional to the axion decay constant fa which is associated with the U (1)PQ symmetry breaking scale. Hence, the couplings are highly suppressed if fa is sufficiently large and this features make the axion suitable to be a DM candidate. Many BSM extensions which features spontaneously broken global U (1) symmetry predict massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons whose couplings are not constrained unlike the original QCD axion. These kind of particles are known as axion like particles (ALPs). Mass of these ALPs are not related to its symmetry breaking scale unlike PQ axion. In general they are not supposed to solve the strong CP problem, but with the introduction of planck scale operators they could solve the strong CP problem [31, 32]. Here we will consider most general SU (2)L  U (1)Y invariant formulation of ALP interactions developed in Refs. [33, 34]. This generic effective ALPs Lagrangian allows ALPs coupling with all the SM gauge bosons as well as with all the SM fermions. In addition to this effective ALP Lagrangian, we introduce three RHNs which can generate light neutrino masses through type-I seesaw. We invoke a Z2 symmetry under which all SM and BSM particles are even except the lightest RHN. Further we introduced the RHN-ALP coupling and show that the lightest RHN which is odd under Z2 can play the role of DM candidate. Note that the phenomenology of this ALP-mediated DM will be similar to pseudoscalar-portal DM. Also DM interacting via the exchange of a light ALP

can induce observable signals in indirect detection experiments while evading the strong bounds from direct DM searches. Note that ALPs with mass Ma  O(GeV) may also show up at colliders [35­37] or in rare meson decays [38, 39].
Rest of the manuscript is organised as follows. In Sec. 2 we introduced our model, detailing the new interactions present. In Sec. 3 we summarise the existing constraints on ALP parameter space coming from various observables and collider searches. In Sec. 4 we have explored and discussed the feasible parameter space coming from DM analyses such as relic density, direct and indirect detection. Finally, we give our conclusions in Sec. 5.

2. MODEL

The model that we consider is the minimal combination of type-I seesaw and effective ALP interaction with additional Z2 symmetry apart from the SM gauge symmetry [40, 41]. The matter content of the model is shown in Table. I. Let's first briefly discuss the features of a generic ALP Lagrangian. We extend the SM particle content by adding an additional ALP which is a singlet under SM charges and is a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken symmetry at some energy which is higher than the electroweak scale v. In effective theory the operators will be weighted by powers of a/fa, where fa is the scale associated to the physics of the ALP, a. Effective linear Lagrangian with one ALP has been already discussed in great detail in Ref. [33, 34]. For linear EWSB realizations the most general linear bosonic Lagrangian involving a is given by,

L = LSM + LALP,

Parameters Ma and fa are the ALP mass and energy scale associated to ALP physics. YD, YU and YE are 3 × 3 matrices in flavour space which stands for down-type quarks, up-type quarks and charged leptons, respectively. We see that ALP Lagrangian has a very generic form than that of the QCD-axion, where the mass of ALP is not restricted by the new physics scale. The remaining fields and parameters are the same as in SM. References [34, 42, 43] have discussed the phenomenology of the various pieces of the model. Now let's introduce the type-I seesaw Lagrangian with three additional SM singlet RHNs:

where Ni are the SM singlet RHNs, Yj is the Dirac Yukawa coupling and Mij is the Majorana mass term. As, N1 is odd under Z2 symmetry, Dirac type of Yukawa interaction is forbidden unlike N2,3. As a result of this, one of the light neutrino will be remain massless and we have enough parameters to describe the neutrino oscillations data. In addition to this, Z2 symmetry stabilizes the N1 and it can play the role of DM candidate if one allows the following ALP-RHN interaction,

where CaNi denotes the ALP-RHNs Wilson coefficient and through this DM particle N1 can communicate with the ALP sector. We call this ALP-portal RHN DM. We consider ALP mass of the order of few hundreds of MeV to GeV. We have considered N1 can have mass up to few TeV. In the next section we discuss the allowed range for the several parameters of the model from the various phenomenological bounds.

3. EXISTING CONSTRAINTS ON ALP PARAMETER SPACE

Before diving into the details of DM analyses, lets first recall the existing experimental bounds on the couplings of ALPs to gluons, photons, fermions and also from collider searches with fa  O(1 TeV) [35, 36, 38, 39, 44­54]. ALP photon coupling is the primary parameter through which astrophysical and cosmological bounds are set on such particles. The ALP and photon coupling can be deduced

Particularly experiments like CAST, using primakoff process, constrained the parameter space (Ma - Ca) heavily for Ma smaller then few eV [55]. For Ma  1 MeV the best present

5

constraint comes from Beam Dump experiments, Ca  10-5 GeV-1 [35] 1. A slightly higher mass range is constrained by the collider experiments such as LEP and LHC [35]. In LEP, the process like e-e+  a  3 is being analysed to constrain the coupling
whereas in LHC it is pp  a which searched for mono, di or tri photon signals. All
these constraints are described in the references [34, 56, 57]. Constraint on CG~ is set by mono jet 8 TeV LHC analysis. Unlike Ca, here it is much more complicated to put bound on CG~ due to large numbers of diagrams involved in the process. However, the dominant digram was found to be gg  ag, which is complicated due to hadronisation that leads to
jets in the final state. These constraints have been analysed in the reference [35, 49]. The limit from this study reads as CG~  10-4 GeV-1 for Ma  0.1 GeV. Also the bound on BR(K+  + + nothing) [58] can be used to constrain the process K+  + + 0(0  a) which can be reinterpreted in terms of ALP-gluon coupling CG~, yielding CG~  10-5 GeV-1 for Ma  60 MeV. Constraints on the ALP matter coupling Ca is studied less compared to gauge boson coupling, however several processes involving flavors have been studied to put
bound on it [38]. The constraints on ALP-fermion coupling Ca depends on the ALP mass. The higher mass range is tested through the rare meson decays. Rare meson decay at Beam
Dump experiments (CHARM) sets tight constraints on Ca for mass range 1 MeV  Ma  3 GeV as Ca/fa < (3.4 × 10-8 - 2.9 × 10-6)GeV-1 [59]. For our interested mass range we summarise the existing tightest constraints in Table. II.

we choose CG~/fa = Ca/fa = 0.1 TeV-1, Ca/fa = 1 TeV-1 and CG~/fa = Ca/fa = 0.1 TeV-1, Ca/fa = 0.001 TeV-1, respectively. We see from Fig. 1 that ALP mostly decays to gluon and photon pair. Also W +W -, ZZ pair contributes significantly as ALP mass

lepton channels only contributes when Ca is relatively large.

4. DARK MATTER ANALYSIS
So far we have discussed the constraints on ALP couplings to SM field. In this section we collect the results of our analyses of DM phenomenology. In our case N1 plays the role of DM due to Z2 symmetry protection. In order to calculate all the vertices, the model is implemented in the FeynRules package [60]. All DM observables such as the thermal component of the DM relic abundance are determined using micrOMEGAS [61] which relies on CalcHEP [62] model file obtained from FeynRules. In the scanning of the relevant parameters of the model, we have imposed phenomenological bounds we discussed earlier. The mass of ALP, Ma is taken O(10 GeV) and mass of N2,3 is always chosen to be greater than N1 for further analysis.

4.1. Relic density
The relevant processes responsible for the freeze-out of DM in the early universe are shown in Fig. 2. All together, they determine the relic abundance of our assumed DM, N1. The annihilation cross section() and thermal average annihilation cross section v and

thus the relic abundance, scales straightforwardly with the parameters of the model. The
exact analytical expressions for all the annihilation cross section are given in Appendix. B
and Appendix. C. For our considered benchmark, only gauge bosons channels are relevant. We see that annihilation cross section for the process N1N1  f f¯ is negligible due to very small value of Ca. On the other hand with the limit MN1 > Ma, N1N1  aa annihilation channel opens up but is v2 suppressed. In Fig. 3, we show the annihilation

narrow horizontal band is the 3 range for cold DM derived from the Planck satellite data [6]:

0.1126  N1h2  0.1246.

(6)

Only for solutions falling exactly within this band the totality of the DM can be explained
by N1. We see from Fig. 4 that for smaller value of DM mass MN1, the required values of CaN1/fa is relatively large to explain the correct relic density.
In Fig. 5 we show the region where the relic density bound N1h2  0.12 holds on the MN1 - CaN1 plane. In the left panel we have choosen three discrete values for the ALP-gluon coupling CG~/fa = 10-3 TeV-1 (red), 10-2 TeV-1 (pink) and 10-1 TeV-1 (gray) by fixing other couplings as Ca/fa = 10-1 TeV-1 and Ca/fa = 10-3 TeV-1. In the right panel, the same analysis is done but now we have fixed CG~/fa = 10-1 TeV-1 and choose three discrete values of ALP-photon coupling, Ca/fa = 10-3 TeV-1 (red), 10-2 TeV-1 (pink) and 10-1 TeV-1 (gray). Note that in left (right) panel for relatively smaller values of ALP-
gluon (ALP-photon) couplings red and pink region overlap. This happens due to subdomi-
nant contribution to the relic density of annihilation channel N1N1  gg (N1N1  ). We
find that when gg channel dominates compared to other annihilation channel, the required
value of CaN1/fa is smaller to satisfy the relic density.

4.2. Direct detection

(7)

Note that this is only valid when mediator ALP mass Ma is relatively large compared to momentum transferred involved in the scattering process. Following Ref. [38, 64­67] we found that in non-relativistic limit, differential scattering cross section to scatter of a nucleus is d/dER  q4, where q2 = 2mN ER is the momentum transfer, mN is the mass of nucleus and ER is the nuclear recoil energy. In direct detection experiments typical recoil energy is O(10 KeV), hence direct detection cross section is heavily suppressed.

4.3. Indirect detection

If DM N1 annihilates to SM final states with annihilation cross section near the thermal relic benchmark value v  3 × 10-26 cm3/s, it may be detected indirectly. Perhaps, 
rays are the best messengers since they proceed almost unaffected during their propagation,
thus carrying both spectral and spatial information. -rays can be produced from DM
annihilation, either mono-energetically from direct annihilation N1N1  , X or with continuum spectra from decays of the annihilation products N1N1  XX¯ (X = SM state). For the process N1N1  X, photons are monochromatic with rest frame energy:

 along with our model predictions for our chosen ALP parameter spaces. We see from the

left panel that even with relatively large coupling Ca/fa the cross-section for mono- lie well below the Fermi-LAT upper bound, whereas in case of di- with relatively large ALPphoton coupling Ca/fa = 0.1 TeV-1, the model prediction lie very close to the Fermi-LAT upper limit. This happens as larger the ALP-photon coupling, larger the DM annihilates

to  channel. This also suggests that future sensitivities of Fermi-LAT can either probe or

exclude large parameter space of the model considered by us.

5. CONCLUSION
We have analysed heavy neutrino DM candidate in a minimal extension of SM, which features three RHNs and one ALP. This model is well motivated as it not only accounts

11
for DM, but it also explains the neutrino oscillations. Hence, ALP mediated RHN DM is interesting from both the model-building and phenomenological perspectives. We have considered the lightest RHN as DM which is odd under Z2 symmetry and identified the region of parameters where DM predictions are in agreement with DM relic abundance. In addition, this model also quite naturally explain the null results of LUX and XENON1T due to the pseudoscalar nature of interactions with quarks. We have highlighted the importance of complementary searches, for instance via indirect detection with single and di-photon. Although the current limits from Fermi-LAT lie above the predicted signals for our choice of parameter space, future sensitivities of Fermi-LAT might offer promising prospects to probe both the low as well as high DM mass regions.
