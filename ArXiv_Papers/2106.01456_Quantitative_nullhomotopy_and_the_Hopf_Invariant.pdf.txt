QUANTITATIVE NULLHOMOTOPY AND THE HOPF INVARIANT
LUIS KUMANDURI
Abstract. Let G : S4n-1  S2n be a map with nonzero Hopf Invariant. Using the generalized Hopf invariant introduced by Hajlasz, Schikorra and Tyson, we show that any null-homotopy F : B4n  B2n+1 of G with small (2n + 1)-dilation must have large (2n)-dilation. In the limit, this gives a simple proof that a Lipschitz null-homotopy cannot have rank(DF )  2n almost everywhere. Conversely, we show that these results are sharp by constructing smooth null-homotopies with arbitrarily small (2n + 1)-dilation.
1. Introduction
The k-dilation dilk(G) of a smooth map G is a generalization of the Lipschitz constant, measuring how much the map stretches or shrinks k-dimensional volumes. In this paper we will study the problem of finding extensions of a map with small k-dilation, and obstructions that arise from topology.
Maps with small k-dilation are closely connected to maps with low-rank derivative. In particular we have that rank(DG)  k - 1 if and only if dilk(G) = 0. The first interesting example of a low-rank map is due to Kaufman in [11], who constructed a surjective map G : [0, 1]3  [0, 1]2 with rank dG  1 almost everywhere. In [14], Wenger-Young constructed rank n extensions of many maps Sm  Sn to maps Bm+1  Bn+1. In [10] Hajlasz-Schikorra-Tyson showed that these extensions do not exist for maps with non-trivial Hopf invariant.
Problems about low-rank extensions are related to the Lipschitz homotopy groups of the Heisenberg group introduced in [3] by Dejarnette, Hajlasz, Lukyanenko and Tyson. Any Lipschitz map from a Riemannian manifold to the Heisenberg group Hn must have rank  n almost everywhere, and so a necessary condition for a map Sm  Hn to admit a Lipschitz null-homotopy is that it has a low-rank extension to the ball. Wenger-Young used their construction to show that some surprising elements of the Lipschitz homotopy groups Lip(Hn) were trivial, while Hajlasz-Schikorra-Tyson showed that the groups 4Lnip-1(H2n) were non-trivial. For most of the groups Lip(Hn), non-triviality is an open question. In [3] and [12], nLip(Hn) was shown to be non-trivial and in [9], Hajlasz show that nL+ip1(Hn) for n  2 is non-trivial. In [14] and [13], Wenger-Young showed the groups nLip(H1) for n  2 and kLip(Hn) for k < n are all trivial. Using different language, Gromov gave an earlier proof of the triviality of kLip(Hn) for k < n in [5]. These are the only known examples. Our hope is that k-dilation will become a useful tool for obstructing low-rank extensions and studying Lip(Hn).
Our main result finds an obstruction to the existence of extensions with small (2n+1)-dilation.
Theorem 1.1. Let G : S4n-1  S2n be a map with nonzero Hopf invariant, and let i : S2n  Rk be an embedding. Let F be a null-homotopy of i  G with 2n-dilation dil2n(F )  C. Then there is a constant c(C, G, i) > 0 so that dil2n+1(F )  c.
As a corollary, we obtain the following theorem of Hajlasz-Schikorra-Tyson ([10]), which can be used to show that 4Lnip-1(H2n) is non-trivial.

Corollary 1.2. The map i  G does not admit a Lipschitz null-homotopy F with rank(DF )  2n almost everywhere.

Proof assuming Theorem 1.1. If there were a homotopy F with rank  2n almost everywhere, we could approximate F by smooth homotopies F with dil2n+1(F) <  and bounded Lipschitz constant Lip(F)  Lip(F ) + . But dil2n(F)  Lip(F)2n, contradicting Theorem 1.1

In order to prove Corollary 1.2, Hajlasz-Schikorra-Tyson introduced a generalized Hopf invariant of maps G : S4n-1  Rk with rank(DG)  2n and showed that it was invariant under Lipschitz homotopies F with rank(DF )  2n almost everywhere. The generalized Hopf invariant is similar to the Whitehead definition of the Hopf invariant and the proof of invariance proceeds similarly. However, a Lipschitz map of rank  2n almost everywhere may not necessarily be approximated by a smooth one preserving the rank condition; therefore one needs to work through the serious technical details to make this argument rigorous for general Lipschitz functions.
The proof of Theorem 1.1 uses similar ideas. We will use the generalized Hopf invariant to obstruct homotopies with bounded 2n-dilation and small (2n + 1)-dilation. The generalized Hopf invariant is no longer an invariant, but we show that it is robust under homotopies of small (2n + 1)-dilation. This gives us the advantage of being able to work directly with smooth functions while also proving a more general theorem.
It is natural to ask if we can drop the condition on 2n-dilation, but our next result shows that this is impossible and that Theorem 1.1 is sharp.

Theorem

1.3.

Let

G : Sm

 Sn

be

a

smooth

map

with

m>n>

m 2

.

Then

for

any

 > 0,

G

extends to a map F : Bm+1  Bn+1 with diln+1(F ) < .

Extending the embedding i : S2n  Rk to a ball and applying Theorem 1.3 immediately gives the following corollary.

Corollary 1.4. i  G admits null-homotopies F : B4n  Rk with arbitrarily small (2n + 1)dilation.

To prove Theorem 1.3, we will utilize Guth's h-principle for k-dilation proved in [7]. Guth

showed

that

maps

Sm



Sn

are

homotopic

to

maps

of

arbitrarily

small

k-dilation

for

k

>

m+1 2

.

Although this theorem doesn't apply directly, we will adapt the construction to create extensions.

Theorem 1.3 is similar to the previously mentioned result of Wenger-Young, who showed in

[14] that if all of the Hopf-Hilton invariants of G : Sm  Sn vanish, then G admits a Lipschitz

extension Bm+1  Bn+1 which has rank  n almost everywhere, i..e diln+1 = 0. This extension was upgraded to C1 in [4]. In particular, if G is homotopic to a suspension, then G admits a rank

n extension to the ball. By the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, when n + 1  m < 2n - 1 all

G are homotopic to suspensions, so Theorem 1.3 gives a new answer for maps S2n-1  Sn.

2. Preliminaries
2.1. k-dilation. In this section we will collect a few basic facts about k-dilation that we use throughout this paper. For proofs of these facts and a broader discussion of k-dilation in topology, we refer the reader to [7].
Let F : M  N be a C1 map between Riemannian manifolds. The k-dilation dilk(F ) is defined by
2

dilk(F )

=

sup
k M

Volk(F (k)) Volk (k )

Here k ranges over k-dimensional submanifolds of M . In particular, if F (M ) lies in a k - 1dimensional subset of N , then dilk(F ) = 0. k-dilation can also be computed infinitesimally from the singular values s1(x)  s2(x)  · · · of DFx : TxM  Tf(x)N by

k
dilk(F ) = sup si(x)
xM i=1
The latter perspective shows that if dF has rank  k - 1, then dilk(F ) = 0. This definition also allows us to relate the k-dilation for different values of k.
Proposition 2.1. If k > j, the dilj(F )1/j  dilk(F )1/k
We use this proposition several times in the paper, but of particular interest to us is the case of j = 1. dil1(F ) = Lip(F ), and so we get the inequality Lip(F )k  dilk(F ). In particular, if a map has small Lipschitz constant, it will also have small k-dilation.
To prove Theorem 1.1, we will take a dual perspective on k-dilation, working with differential forms instead of submanifolds.
Proposition 2.2. Let   k(N ) be a differential form, then

||F ||L(k(M))  dilk(F )||||L(k(N))
Proposition 2.2 is very useful for establishing obstructions to small k-dilation in special cases. Many rational homotopy invariants can be computed using the pullback of differential forms, and Proposition 2.2 allows one to bound these invariants using k-dilation.
2.2. Generalized Hopf Invariant. In [10], Hajlasz-Shikorra-Tyson introduced the generalized Hopf invariant of a rank 2n-map F : S4n-1  Rk. By rank 2n we mean that rank(DF )  2n. In this section we will give the definition and discuss some properties and results about the generalized Hopf invariant.
Let   2n(Rk) be a 2n-form. Then F  is a closed form on S4n-1. This is because dF  = F d = 0, where the last fact follows since F has rank 2n and d is a (2n + 1)-form. Thus there is a form  on S4n-1 so that d = F , and we can define the generalized Hopf invariant H(F ) by

H(F ) =

  F

S 4n-1

Proposition 2.3. H(F ) is independent of the choice of primitive .

Proof. If  is another primitive of F , then d( - ) = 0. Therefore we can find  so that d = ( - ). But then we have that d(  F ) =   F  -   F , so Stoke's Theorem gives
the result.

We can now consider the case that F factors through an embedding i : S2n  Rk via a map G : S4n-1  S2n, and S2n i = 1 Then the definition of H coincides with the Whitehead definition of the Hopf invariant ([1]) and we see that Hopf(G) = H(i  G).
Lastly we state the main result of [10], and sketch the proof ignoring the technical details needed to make the argument work for general Lipschitz homotopies.

Theorem 2.1. Let F be a Lipschitz homotopy between rank 2n maps F0 and F1 such that rank(DF )  2n almost everywhere. Then H(F0) = H(F1)
Proof Sketch. We will give the proof pretending that F is smooth. In this case, F  is a closed 2n-form on S4n-1 × I, hence exact and we can find  on S4n-1 × I so that d = F . Notice that F |S4n-1×{i} = Fi, and so by Stoke's Theorem.

H(F1) - H(F0) =

d(  F )

S 4n-1 ×I

d(  F ) = F (  ) -   F d. But since F has rank 2n, both F d = 0 and F (  ) =

0

3. Proof of Theorem 1.1
In this section we prove Theorem 1.1, which will follow from a more technical result about the generalized Hopf invariant.
Theorem 3.1. Let F0, F1 : S4n-1  Rk be smooth maps of rank 2n, and   2n(Rk) be a 2n-form, with ||||L , ||d||L  c. Let F be a smooth homotopy between F0 and F1. Then there is a constant c depending only on n and c such that

|H (F0 )

)dil2n+1(F

)

dil2n+1(F

) 2n+1

Recall that H is the generalized Hopf invariant discussed in Section 2.2.

In other words, Theorem 3.1 tells us that the generalized Hopf invariant is robust under
homotopies of small (2n + 1)-dilation, even though it is not an invariant for general homotopies. In particular, if F is L-Lipschitz, then dil2n(F )  L2n, and we obtain an inequality of the form

|H(F0) - H(F1)| dil2n+1(F ) + dil2n+1(F )2 Our strategy is to mimic the sketch we gave of Theorem 2.1. The proof relies on the form F  being closed. In our case, it is no longer closed but instead is almost closed in a precise sense. We will then use the co-isoperimetric inequality to show that F  is almost exact. Using these estimates, we will bound the failure of Theorem 2.1 in terms of dil2n(F ) and dil2n+1(F ), which will give the result.
Proof of Theorem 3.1. In the proof we will use the notation A B to mean there is a constant c depending on n and c so that A  cB. We will use the following lemma repeatedly.
Proposition 3.1 (Co-Isoperimetric Inequality ([6])). Let M = S4n-1, S4n-1 × I and   (M ) be an exact form. Then  = d with ||||L ||||L
Proposition 3.1 follows from Lemma 7.13 of [6]. Other variants of this lemma appear in [2] and [8], and the result is well-known as a dual to the linear isoperimetric inequality on a compact manifold.
Consider the 2n-form F , and notice that ||F ||L dil2n(F ). F  is not closed, but dF  = F d, so ||dF || dil2n+1(F ). By the co-isoperimetric inequality, there is a 2n-form  on S4n-1 × I so that d = F d and ||||L dil2n+1(F ). F  -  is a closed 2n-form, and hence exact, so by the co-isoperimetric inequality we can find   2n-1(S4n-1 × I) with d = F  -  and ||||L dil2n(F ) + dil2n+1(F ).
By Stoke's Theorem, we have that

S 4n-1 ×[0,1]

Our goal is to relate the boundary terms to H(Fi), with an error term involving dil2n+1(F ), and then expand d(  F ) and bound all the terms individually.
On the spheres S4n-1 × {i}, for i = 0, 1 we have that dF  = Fid = 0 since the maps Fi have rank  2n. Therefore there is a form ~ on S4n-1 with d~ = Fi, and ||~|| dil2n(F ). Thus S4n-1×{i} ~  F  = Hw(Fi) for i = 0, 1, so we have that

(2)

  F  = Hw(Fi) +

Now d( - ~) = |S4n-1 , so there is a form   2n-1(S4n-1) such that d =  and |||| dil2n+1(F ).  -~- is a closed and exact 2n-1-form. Thus we can find  so that d =  -~-. Then d(  F ) = ( - ~)  F  -   F  since dF |S4n-1×{i} = 0. Therefore by Stoke's Theorem

where the latter estimate follows from our estimates for  and F . Combining (1), (2) and (3) we obtain that

|H(F1) - H(F0)| |

d(  F )| + dil2n(F )dil2n+1(F )

S 4n-1 ×[0,1]

It remains to estimate d(F ) = -F d+F ()-F . We have that ||F ||

||||||F || (dil2n(F ))(dil2n+1(F )). Similarly we can estimate ||F (  )|| dil4n(F ) 

4n
dil2n+1(F ) 2n+1 .

Finally

we

can

estimate

||  F d||

(dil2n(F ) + dil2n+1(F ))dil2n+1(F ). Inte-

grating all of these estimates over S4n-1 × [0, 1] proves the theorem.

We can now prove our main result

Proof of Theorem 1.1. We use the notation in the statement of Theorem 1.1. In order to apply the theorem, take F0 = i  G, and F1 to be any constant map. We can choose  to be any extension of a volume form on i(S2n) which vanishes outside some compact set, so that there exists c depending only on i, with ||||, ||d||  c. Then H(F0) = Hopf(G) and H(F1) = 0. If there was a null-homotopy F with dil2n(F )  C and dil2n+1(F ) < , then Theorem 3.1 implies

But since Hopf(G) is nonzero, we cannot take  arbitrarily small, which gives the result.

4. Proof of Theorem 1.3

For convenience, we restate Theorem 1.3

Then

for

any

G

extends to a map F : Bm+1  Bn+1 with diln+1(F ) < .

Our strategy is to modify Guth's construction of maps with small k-dilation in [7], which we will now briefly describe. Guth started with a map F0 : Sm  Sn, and constructed degree 1-maps  : Sm  Sm and  : Sn  , so that   F0   has small k-dilation.
 was constructed by splitting Sn = A  B into two subsets. (A) lies in a (k - 1)-dimensional subcomplex of Sn, and hence dilk(|A) = 0, while |B has bounded Lipschitz constant.
To construct , we only have to worry about dilk(|-1(F0-1(B))). Guth did so by constructing embeddings F0-1(B)  Sm which expanded all directions by a large factor. When k is in the right range of dimensions, these embeddings are isotopic to the inclusion F0-1(B)  Sm, and so extend to a diffeomorphism -1 : Sm  Sm. Because these embedding expand all directions, 
has small Lipschitz constant on the desired subset and therefore small k-dilation.
To prove Theorem 1.3, we will have to modify this argument to work so that  and  are now maps from Bn+1  Bn+1 and Bm+1  Bm+1 which fix the boundary of the balls, and therefore
the resulting map is an extension.

Proof of Theorem 1.3. For the following proof, we will take Bm+1, Bn+1 to be unit balls of radius

1, and equip Sm and Sn with the round metric.

Fix a smooth extension F0 : Bm+1  Bn of G. We will use the notation A B to mean

that there is a constant c(F0) depending only on F0 so that A  cB. Fix small constants  > 0

and W 1. W will be chosen later depending only on F0, and  will be as small as we like and eventually taken to 0. We will find maps  : Bm+1  Bm+1 and  : Bn+1  Bn+1 such that

|Sm, |Sn = Id and diln+1(  F0  ) <  as   0.

so

Let Q = Zn+1  Br(O), and we will let VW be the W  neighborhood of Q  Br(O). Notice

that the complement Br(O)/VW retracts relative to the boundary onto an n-dimensional complex,

namely the union of the sphere Br(O) with the n-dimensional lattice that is dual to Q. The

map  will essentially be given by this retraction.

(3) Lip(R)  c(W ), in particular the Lipschitz constant depends only on W and is independent of .

By modifying H near 0 and 1,  can be made smooth. Since H, , R are all maps with

 and property (1) of R, (Bn+1/VW ) lies in (~ )Sn, which is an n-dimensional subcomplex of

Bn+1, in particular we have that diln+1(|Bn+1/VW ) = 0. Finally we have that |Sn = |Sn = Id,

as desired.

With the construction of  in hand, let us turn our focus to the construction of . Let UW = F0-1(VW ). Using the diffeomorphism F0-1(Br(O)) = F0-1(O) × Br, we see that UW = F0-1(O) × VW , and the map F0 is given by projection onto the second factor. Let h0, h1 be the metrics on F0-1(O), VW respectively given by restricting the standard metrics from the balls. Let g0 = h0 + h1 be a metric on UW under the product identification. Note that g0 is bi-Lipschitz to the restriction of the standard metric on UW with bi-Lipschitz constant 1. Let g1 = 2h0 +h1 be a metric on UW given by shrinking the F0-1(O) factor. Notice that Lip(F0 : (UW , g1)  VW ) 1, since all we did is shrink the fibers of F0.

Lemma 4.3. We can choose W 1 so that there is a diffeomorphism  : Bm+1  Bm+1 with the following properties

all lengths by a factor L  n+1

This isotopy can be taken to miss a point p. When  is small, F0-1(Br(O)) lies in (1 - )Bm+1, and there is a c-expanding map P : Sm+1/p  Bm+1(1-) for c 1. Then P I is an embedding
n-m
isotopic to the inclusion which expands all lengths by a factor of cL  n+1 . Since this isotopy lies in (1 - )Bm+1, we can extend it to a diffeomorphism -1 of Bm+1 which is the identity near the boundary. Since -1 is expanding on UW , we immediately obtain that |-1(UW ) has small Lipschitz constant, as desired.

We can now complete the proof of Theorem 1.3. Let F =   F0  . Let A1 = -1(UW ), and A2 = Bm+1/A1. By construction, F0  (A2)  Bn+1/VW , and so by Lemma 4.1, we have that diln+1(F |A2 ) = 0. On A1, we have that

, which follows from Lemmas 4.1 and 4.3 as Lip(F0 : (UW , g1)  VW 1. Then by Proposition 2.1, we have diln+1(F |A1 )  Lip(F |A1 )n+1 m-n. Thus we have that diln+1(F ) m-n, and taking   0 we can make the (n + 1)-dilation as small as we like. Lastly, since |Sm = Id and |Sn = Id, we see that F agrees with F0 on Sm, and is therefore an extension of G to the ball.
