Magnetic impurities in s-wave superconductors lead to spin-polarized Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) in-gap states. Chains of magnetic impurities offer one of the most viable routes for the realization of Majorana bound states which hold a promise for topological quantum computing. However, this ambitious goal looks distant since no quantum coherent degrees of freedom have yet been identified in these systems. To fill this gap we propose an effective two-level system, a YSR qubit, stemming from two nearby impurities. Using a time-dependent wave-function approach, we derive an effective Hamiltonian describing the YSR qubit evolution as a function of distance between the impurity spins, their relative orientations, and their dynamics. We show that the YSR qubit can be controlled and read out using the state-of-the-art experimental techniques for manipulation of the spins. Finally, we address the effect of the spin noises on the coherence properties of the YSR qubit, and show a robust behaviour for a wide range of experimentally relevant parameters. Looking forward, the YSR qubit could facilitate the implementation of a universal set of quantum gates in hybrid systems where they are coupled to topological Majorana qubits.

I. INTRODUCTION
The goal to build a fault tolerant quantum computer has allowed to deepen the understanding of the quantum realm in a plethora of systems, as well as to an advancement in developing novel quantum technologies. Trapped ions, semiconductor quantum dots, superconducting circuits and hybrid semiconductor-superconductor platforms are some of the examples which have played crucial role in developing the field of quantum computing [1­14].
While superconducting-circuit based qubits have been at the forefront of the immense recent progress, proposals that utilize the low-energy bound states in superconductors, i. e. the Andreev levels, have been also under intense scrutiny for quantum computing [15­21]. The reasons are two-fold: (i) the dimensions of Andreev states-based qubits ( µm) are typically much smaller than the sizes of the conventional superconducting qubits (mm), which facilitates designing quantum registers with higher qubit densities and (ii) they constitute the building blocks of topological quantum computers based on Majorana zero modes, which have experienced significant theoretical and experimental research efforts [22­ 27].
Magnetic impurities in superconductors lead to localised Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) in-gap Andreev states [28­34], with chains and lattices of impurities being viable setups to realize topological superconductors hosting the Majorana modes [35­44, 44­58]. The advantage of these implementations is rooted in the ability to pattern superconducting surfaces with magnetic impurities, and possibly engineer (topological) quantum processors in a controlled fashion. Moreover, through the use of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) techniques, they can be interrogated locally, with high spatial resolution. A drawback, however, is that the system parameters are hard to

FIG. 1: The YSR qubit: Two classical spins, target (red) and test (blue), are placed on top of a 2D s-wave superconductor at a distance R inducing a double-well potential that accommodates two in-gap YSR states for a given parity. The odd parity states |0 and |1 define the YSR qubit states. The asymmetry of the potential stems from the slightly different coupling parameters at the two sites. The hybridization of the two YSR states is quantified by a tunneling Hamiltonian HT . Driving the test spin effectively tunes the potential bias and, when at resonance with the qubit splitting 2 = q, it allows for coherent rotations of the qubit. The target spin is interrogated off-resonantly at a frequency 1 = q for quantum non-demolition detection of the YSR qubit state. Alternatively, the qubit can be also operated with just a single tip.

tune making it difficult to control the topological regime of the system, or to manipulate the emerging Majorana modes. Several solutions have been put forward, among which are exploiting the dynamics of the magnetic impurities [59, 60], driving the YSR states with microwave fields [61], varying the orientation of external magnetic

2

fields [62, 63], or tuning the Josephson effect through a superconducting tip coupled to the YSR states [64].
The realization of the Majorana-based topological quantum computer in Shiba chains looks distant since no quantum coherent degrees of freedom have yet been identified in these systems. In this paper, we show that the minimal system for the demonstration of the quantumness of these systems is a new type of superconducting qubit, the YSR qubit, stemming from two nearby impurities. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the magnetic impurities can be used for controlling the quantum state of the YSR qubit and we uncover the requirements for experimentally observing Rabi oscillations in this system. The precession of the magnetic impurities also leads to a feedback torque acting on the impurities due to the YSR states [65], and we show that this effect can be utilized for the read out of the YSR qubit states. We also address the effect of the spin noises on the coherence properties of the YSR qubit, and show a robust behaviour for a wide range of experimentally relevant parameters. Our proposal is feasible with the state-of-the-art experimental techniques, because controlled coupling of YSR states in impurity dimers have already been experimentally demonstrated [66­68] and the manipulation of the impurity spins is possible through STM electron spin resonance (STM-ESR) techniques [69­73]. Finally, we discuss the possibilities to utilize the YSR qubits in hybrid systems where they are coupled to Majorana qubits.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we introduce the model Hamiltonian describing the dynamical spin dimer. Using a time-dependent wave-function approach, in Sec. III we derive the effective YSR qubit Hamiltonian in the presence of the precessing spins. In Sec. IV, we discuss how to implement coherent Rabi oscillations of the YSR qubit and provide a specific manipulation protocol. Then, in Sec. V we demonstrate that spin dynamics can be utilised for the read-out of the YSR qubit. In Sec. VI we introduce a hybrid YSR qubit - Majorana (topological) qubit that can be operated to achieve a universal set of quantum gates. We conclude with a discussion in Sec. VII.

II. MODEL HAMILTONIAN

The time-dependent Bogolioubov de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian describing the spin dimer system in Fig. 1 can be written in the Nambu basis (r) = [c(r), c(r), c(r), -c(r)]T as

HBdG(t) = H0 +

Vj(t)(r - Rj) ,

(1)

j=1,2

H0 = pz + x ,

Vj(t) = JjSj(t) ·  ,

where H0 is the superconductor Hamiltonian and Vj(t) describes the coupling of electrons to the classical spins
Sj(t) = S[sin j(t) cos j(t), sin j(t) sin j(t), cos j(t)]

with time-dependent polar j(t) and azimuthal j(t) angles (j = 1, 2). Here, Rj = 0(R) is the position of the spin j = 1 (j = 2), Jj are the coupling strengths,  = (x, y, z) and  = (x, y, z) are the Pauli matrices in the spin and particle-hole spaces,  is the superconducting order parameter and p = p2/2m - µ is the kinetic energy of the electrons with effective mass m, momentum p, and chemical potential µ. For simplicity, we neglect the scalar potentials generated by the magnetic impurities as they do not affect directly the dynamics. The target spin S1 and test spin S2 can be addressed and driven individually through STM-ESR, and they are used for read out and manipulation, respectively.
Before proceeding with a detailed description of the dynamics, let us provide some physical insights to the spin dimer in Fig. 1 based on the recent findings in Ref. 65 concerning the dynamics of a single magnetic impurity in an s-wave SC. We first note that for the static case, the Shiba energy is given by ES = (1 - 2)/(1 + 2), with  = 0JS and 0 being the density of states at the Fermi level in the normal state. For a spin precessing with frequency   (adiabatic limit) at an angle  around the z axis, the effective Shiba energy was found to be ES() ES - (/2) cos , i. e. it is shifted by the Berry phase contribution. Moreover, this dynamical YSR state was found to act back on the classical spin via a universal torque  S(t) = (nS - 1/2)FS n (t), where n(t) = S(t)/S, nS is the YSR state occupation number and FS is the radial Berry curvature. In the absence of spin-orbit interaction FS = 1/2. This torque modifies the bare resonance frequency 0 of the classical spin as /0  (1/S)(nS - 1/2)FS, being a direct measurement of the occupation nS. The energy shift (on the Shiba side) and the frequency shift (on the classical spin side) are at the core of our proposal depicted in Fig. 1: the former allows to control the bias of the double well potential by driving one of the spins, analogously to tuning the voltage-bias in double quantum dots [74], while the latter facilitates extracting the occupation of the ingap states, in analogy to quantum non-demolition qubit readouts in cavity quantum electrodynamics setups [75]. The hybridization between the two YSR states will modify the single-impurity findings, and in the following we proceed to describe in detail the dynamical YSR dimer system.
III. EFFECTIVE QUBIT HAMILTONIAN
Next we derive the low-energy Hamiltonian describing the in-gap "molecular" YSR states stemming from the dynamical spin dimer using a time-dependent wave function approach which will allow us to identify the effective two-level system defining the YSR qubit. The system dynamics is described by the time-dependent BdG equation it(r, t) = HBdG(t)(r, t), where (r, t) = [u(r, t), u(r, t), v(r, t), -v(r, t)]T is the BdG wavefunction. It is instructive to switch to the Fourier space

k e-ik·r(k, t) (d is the dimension of the

system), which in turn allows us to write

j=1,2

Assuming that the Shiba energies are close to the Fermi
level (deep Shiba limit 1,2  1) and adiabatic dynamics of the classical spins on the scale of T = /, we can follow the approach described in Ref. [41, 60] to derive
an effective time-dependent 8 × 8 Schrodinger equation that describes the dimer it~i(t) = Hij(t)~j(t). Here, ~1(2)(t) = 1(2)(0(R), t) is a 4-component spinor at position r = 0 (r = R) in the Nambu and spin space, while
the diagonal elements H11(22)(t)  H1(2)(t) describe the interaction of SC with the spins at the positions r = 0(R)

and H12(t) = HT (t) represents the tunnelling between the YSR states at different impurities
HT (t) = -(n1 · )(n2 · )[I~0(R)x + I~1(R)z] . (4)

Here, ni(t) = Si(t)/Si and I~0,1(R) are evaluated from the overlap integrals for two impurities separated by a distance R in the superconductor [76]. We point out that the time-dependence of the classical spins generates a Berry-phase contribution (the second term in Eq. (3)) that cannot be captured by only forging the effective static theory time-dependent. As shown later, while this term does not affect the qubit Hamiltonian, it does change drastically the spin expectation values at each impurities, in particular the contributions perpendicular to the instantaneous classical spin directions (and which are responsible to the torques acting on the latter). This is one of the instances when an effective static theory does not suffice to describe the low-energy sector dynamics.
Let us first consider the dimer in the absence of dynamics. Projecting the above 8 × 8 Hamiltonian blocks, Hi and HT , onto the low energy sector results in an effective 4 × 4 Hamiltonian describing the in-gap states [41, 60], (see [76] for more details). Assuming 1 = 0 (i. e. the first spin defines the z-axis) the in-gap energy spectrum of the 4 × 4 Hamiltonian becomes |E1,2| = (B ± C)/(212), where

Here 2 is the classical spin precession frequency that matches the qubit splitting. The inset shows the energy width E = [ q(0) - q()] / [ q(0) + q()] as a function of  = 1 - 2, and for several values of R. (b) The many-body energy spectrum EMB for 1 = 1.15, 2 = 1.1 and R = 2.9 in the absence of Coulomb interactions. The dotted lines represent the many-body energy spectrum for 1 = 2 = 1.1, showing a crossing at  = . Here, {|10 , |01 } and {|00 , |11 } label the odd and even parity states, respectively, with the YSR qubit being encoded in the former. In both plots we have used kF = 13.55.

with vF being the Fermi velocity. In Fig. 2a we show the corresponding energy spectrum as a function of . The inset of Fig. 2a depicts the relative maximum deviation in the energy difference between the lowest two energy states as a function of  = 1 - 2 for various separation distances R. From these plots we can infer that (i) even for moderate values of  the dependence of the energies Ei on  is negligible and (ii) generally these energies are not equidistant. We can then encode the YSR qubit in the two lowest energy states defined by the {-E1, -E2} which, for a wide range of parameters, are also well separated from the excited pair {E1, E2}. The qubit Hamiltonian can be written as Hq = ( q/2)z, where q  q() = C/(12) is the qubit splitting, and z is the z component of the Pauli matrix acting on the states defined by {-E1, -E2}.
It is useful to describe the YSR qubit using a manybody states |n1n2 , where n1,2 = 0, 1 are the occupancies of the single particle states. Specifically, the pair of states {|00 , |11 } ({|01 , |10 }) span the even (odd) parity many-body states with energies ±|E1 + E2|/2 (±|E1 - E2|/2). Note that within the BdG description the two parity sectors are decoupled, and the YSR qubit defined above acts within the odd-parity states. This choice for the YSR qubit is further justified by its insensitivity to the Coulomb interaction effects that are present for double occupancy (even parity). The many-body energy spectrum depicting the odd and even parity states is shown in Fig. 2b. While the ground state corresponds to the even parity state |11 for the chosen parameters, the odd parity sector can be selected by tuning the offset charge with a gate voltage in the case of a finite supercon-

4

ducting island with a sufficiently large charging energy. Alternatively, one can utilize the spin dynamics for the initialization of the system to the odd parity state.
The many-body picture also allows us to gain further insight on the origin of the qubit states, which is determined by max(, th). For  th, the qubit states stem from the two individual YSR states formed under each of the impurities, while in the opposite regime  th, they correspond to the symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of the individual YSR states, being dictated by the tunneling. The first scenario is more advantageous as the qubit energies become insensitive to , as depicted in Fig. 2, rendering it more robust against fluctuations.
Having defined the YSR qubit, we can now reinstate the dynamics of the classical spins which we will exploit for the manipulation and read out of the qubit states. Without loss of generality, in the following we assume that only one spin precesses. Projecting the 4 × 4 timedependent Hamiltonian onto the YSR qubit subspace, we obtain the following qubit Hamiltonian [76]:

Eqs. (6) and (7) establish the imprints of the classical spin dynamics on the effective YSR qubit Hamiltonian and represent one of our main findings. Above we disregarded the terms that act as identity in the qubit space. The first two terms in Eq.

IV. YSR QUBIT MANIPULATION
The YSR qubit can be manipulated by utilising the second term in Eq. 6. The pulse sequence for introducing Rabi oscillations is shown schematically in Fig. 3a. The logical states of the qubit are defined in a parallel classical spins alignment, and the resonant oscillations between the states of the qubit are induced in the antiparallel configuration. Before describing the details of the sequence, let us underline the physical reasons for this choice. The i(t) terms in Eq. (7) are much weaker for deviations  around  = 0 (x,z  ()2 and y  ) than when the same deviations occur in proximity of

FIG. 3: (a) The pulse sequences proposal for coherent manipulation of the YSR qubit: the right spin (blue) is first rotated adiabatically from  = 0 to  =  in time Ta, then driven into resonant precession with the qubit for a time Tl, after which it is rotated back adiabatically to its original orientation. The qubit can also be fully operated in the anti-parallel configuration. (b) The Rabi oscillations encoded in the probability of state |1 being occupied, P1(Tl) = | 1|(Tl) |2, as a function of the pulse time Tl for Ta = 6Tq and Tb = 0.6Tq.

phase, on the other hand, this is beneficial since the qubit

will be more robust against random fluctuations in the

angles  and  (discussed below). Nevertheless, the qubit

can also be operated fully in the anti-parallel geometry,

at the expense of shorter coherence times.

Let |0 and |1 be the eigenstates of the static qubit

Hamiltonian at  = 0, and assume the qubit is initial-

ized in state |0 at time t = 0. Then, at time t, the

qubit state becomes |(t) = Uq(t, 0)|0 where the evo-

lution operator is Uq(t, 0) = T e- i

be-

ing the time-ordering operator. In the first part of the

protocol in Fig. 3a, the right classical spin is rotated

from parallel to the anti-parallel configuration via a pulse

(t) =  tanh(2t/Ta) where Ta is the pulse length, and the evolution operator is Uq,1  Uq(Ta, 0). The amplitude of the Rabi oscillations is largest if the the qubit

5

remains in state |0 during this pulse. Thus, ideal results are obtained if 0 -  transition is adiabatic, i. e. Ta Tq with Tq = / q, but almost ideal Rabi oscillations can be achieved also for fast pulses [76]. In the second part of
the sequence the classical spin is driven into circular pre-
cession around the z axis so that the precession frequency
2 is in resonance with the qubit splitting 2 = q. Consequently, the qubit undergoes coherent Rabi oscillations, and the evolution is described by Uq,2  Uq(Ta + Tl, Ta). In our calculations we use a spiral pulse (t) = 2t and

which first stabilizes the precession of the spin to a cone

angle  =  -  in a time Tb, then causes a precession of

the spin for a duration Tl - 2Tb and finally restores the

classical spin back Tq implies that the

teovolu=tioninintdimuceedTbb.yAs(stu)mduinrginTgbthe

ramping periods is practically frozen and we can write

Uq,2  Uq-,21gUq,2rUq,2g, where Uq,2g and Uq,2r correspond

to the evolution from  to  -  at  = 0 and the

evolution induced by the circular precession at fixed  ( = 0) during the time Tl-2Tb, respectively. Finally, the classical spin is rotated back to the parallel configuration using Uq,3  Uq-,11.
The amplitude and the period of the Rabi oscilla-

tions can be determined by calculating how the prob-

ability for the qubit to be in state |1 after a pulse,

P1(Tl) = | 1|(Tl) |2 with |(Tl) = Uq(Tl)|0 , depends on the precession time Tl. We have implemented numerically the evolution operator pertaining to Uq(t), and in Fig. 3b we plot P1(Tl) showing the Rabi oscillations of the qubit for the parameters  = 0.05,  = 0.1, R = 2.9.

Increasing the precession angle  increases the Rabi os-

cillations frequency as R  th, but in turn reduces

their amplitude, as depicted in Figs. 3c,d. The latter is

a consequence of the transformation Uq,2g which gener-

ates a finite weight c1  (th/) on the state |1 for

th . Therefore, for a given R, the requirement for

P1m  max[P1(Tl)]  1 is R

q which, coinciden-

tally, is similar to the adiabaticity condition in the first

part of the protocol. Moreover, in the limit Tb Tq

the transformation Uq,2g is purely geometrical [76], and thus independent on the details of the pulse that tilts

the classical spin away from the z axis by an angle .

As stressed above, the manipulation can be fully per-

formed in the anti-parallel configuration, in which case

Uq(Tl, 0)  Uq,2. Both the parallel and anti-parallel configurations have been observed experimentally, their re-

alisation depending on the specific implementation and

the distance between the impurities [67, 77].

To give some estimates for the time scale of the Rabi

oscillations, let us assume  = 0.1, R = 2.9 and

 = 0.05. These rather conservative parameter values

result in Rabi oscillation period TR  8.5 ns, which is comparable to the Rabi times observed in implementa-

tions of the Andreev qubits [17]. For the YSR qubit to

be useful, the Rabi time should be much shorter than the

time scales over which it looses its coherence, namely the relaxation (T1) and pure dephasing (T) times, which to the best of our knowledge, are largely unknown for the YSR states. Nevertheless, we can readily identify several possible sources of decoherence: (i) quasiparticle poisoning, that can lead to relaxation times as large as seconds in state-of-the-art devices [78­80], (ii) phononinduced excitations of the Shiba electrons into the bulk of the SC activated at finite temperature [81], and (iii) thermal fluctuations in the magnetic moments that define the YSR states. The first two mechanisms can be accounted for by a phenomenological line-width of the YSR states, r, which in-principle can be extracted from STM-ESR measurements in the limit of weak tunnel coupling [82]. The last mechanism, on the other hand, have not been discussed in the literature and in the following we give a short account of its effects. The Hamiltonian describing the coupling of the qubit to the magnetization fluctuations of spins k = 1, 2 reads:

Hq(t) =

nk(t) · k ·  ,

(9)

k=1,2

with the tensor k  [k] quantifying the coupling of the two orthogonal fluctuations  = 1, 2 (nk(t)  nk) of each classical spin k to the qubit Pauli matrices  = x, y, z. The elements of the tensor k can be found by projecting nk HBdG onto the qubit basis [76]. Within the Bloch-Redfield framework [83], we find the following
expressions for the dephasing and relaxation times, re-
spectively:

where k  = k x + ik y and Sk() = (1/2) dte-it nk,(t)nk,(0) is the noise spectrum pertaining to the fluctuations nk,(t). Above, the  = +(-) terms represent the emission (absorption)
rates that are related by the detailed balance condition
at equilibrium. The spectrum of the fluctuations nk(t) is determined by the specific form of the classical spins
free energy FS(n) and, in order to give estimates for the above decoherence times, we consider the following form
(assuming the two spins identical):

stochastic contribution whose Fourier components satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation relations B()B( ) = (g )/(2S) [coth ( /2kBT ) - 1] ( +  ) [84], where g and  are the Gilbert damping and gyromagnetic coefficient, respectively. Utilising the Landau-Lifhitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation that describes the dynamics of the classical magnets in the presence of the stochastic magnetic fields B(t), we can evaluate the correlators Sk() in terms of B()B( ) (see [76] for more details). For simplicity, we focus only on the static (idle) parallel and anti-parallel spin configurations, assuming a spin S = 5/2 at each site [85]. In both cases, we find that 1/T = 0 and, furthermore 1/T1 = 0 at  = 0, justifying quantitatively our choice for the qubit basis in the idle phase. However, at  =  the longitudinal relaxation rate is non-zero, and assuming g = 0.001,  = 0.1 meV, 1 = 1.15, 2 = 1.1, R = 2.9 and temperature T0 = 100 mK < q, we obtain T1  3.5 µs and T2 = 2T1  7 µs [86]. Comparing that to the Rabi oscillation period we estimate that the YSR qubit can undergo a large number of Rabi oscillations before it decoheres.

The ability to measure efficiently and fast the outcome of a computation is a prerequisite for a practical qubit. Furthermore, it allows to initialize the qubit state at the beginning of the computation. Here, we show that the qubit state can be measured using STM-ESR techniques via the torques induced by the YSR states on the classical spins. In the following, we focus on the case when the measurement is performed in the parallel spin configuration and the left spin (target) is interrogated offresonantly with the qubit splitting as shown in Fig. 1. The former condition is considered in order to minimize the decoherence effects, while the latter allows to physically separate the manipulation and detection.
The dynamics of the left spin, S1, is governed by the LLG equation
S 1 = -S1 × B(t) +  + gS1 × S 1 , (13)
where  = J1S1 × (r) is the torque pertaining to the electrons in the SC that act on spin S1, including the YSR qubit contribution, while B(t) is the timedependent external magnetic field utilised to drive the precession.
We have employed a Green function approach that describes the 8 × 8 Hamiltonian [60] to evaluate the total torque   for the two YSR qubit states  = 0, 1 (see [76] for more details). Considering S1 to precess with frequency 1 in the adiabatic limit 1 , we can write     s +  d, where the first term ( s) originates from the misalignment of the two classical spins, and it describes the in-gap states contribution to the RKKY interaction, while the latter ( d  1) have been unravelled recently in Ref. 65 and found to have a geometrical (Berry phase) origin. In Fig. 4a we show the magnitudes

of the total torque  , as well as the two individual contributions  s and  d, as a function of  for each of the two qubit states. We see that the torques are deter-

mined by the static term s while in the opposite regime,

in the 1||

limtit2h,t1h|ed|ynamt2hi-,

cal contribution d dominates and, moreover, it reaches

a universal value associated with an isolated impurity

[65]. We mention that throughout the section we have

neglected the effect of the bulk states on both the static

and dynamical torques. In Ref. [87] it was shown that the

(static) bulk contribution, which represents the conven-

tional RKKY interaction, becomes negligible compared

to that of the YSR in-gap states for separations R  1.

Furthermore, a full non-equilibrium calculation for a sin-

gle impurity showed that the YSR states dominate the

dynamical torque in the adiabatic regime and, moreover,

that a finite YSR linewidth imprints onto the magnetic

impurity linewidth [65], which could be utilised to mea-

sure the coherence times of the YSR qubit.

In the limit of small cone angle precession (  0), we

can linearize the LLG equation, and extract the renor-

malized resonance frequency of spin S1 for each qubit state in terms of the torques as [76]

(14)

where d = (2/1) (d/) |=0, s = (s/) |=0, and 0 is the bare resonance frequency. The difference  = r,1 - r,0 discriminates the two qubit states in STM-ESR measurements and represents one of our main
findings. In Fig. 4b we plot  as a function of  for

7

various distances R. For separations R such that t2h 1||, the difference  saturates to a constant value, which we find to be   8S0/(16S2 - 1) [65]. That is

because the two impurities become practically decoupled,

resulting in s  0, and only the dynamical torque from the isolated impurity contributes to the signal. We see

again here that the optimal regime for operating the YSR

qubit is t2h 1||, as  is almost invariable (flat) for a wide range of system parameters.

To enrich the understanding of the above results, here

we present an heuristic derivation of the YSR qubit

torques from basic energy considerations. In the read-

out regime  = 0 and 1 =  = q, so that the effective

qubit splitting is

eff q

=

q + 2z and we can neglect the

x,y terms in Eq. (7). Then, the magnitude of the torque

acting on the spin S1 by the YSR qubit in state  = 0, 1

can

be

expressed

(15)

We see that for t2h

1|| the dynamical torque

dominates, reaching a universal value d  (1/4) sin ,

consistent with the findings in Fig. 4a. On the other

hand, for t2h 1|| the torque is controlled by the static contribution s, and reaches the asymptotic value s  -(th/412) sin(kF R + /4) sin (/2) that depends strongly on the separation R between the impurities.

This is again consistent with the findings in Fig. 4a. In-

terestingly, while for t2h 1|| the torque d behaves similarly around  = , for 1 = 2   we obtain s  -(th/42) sin(kF R + /4), which is a consequence of the two qubit levels crossing each other: even though

the spins are anti-parallel, a torque is exerted between

the two, which is to be contrasted with the RKKY in-

teractions mediated by the bulk [87]. This can be also

interpreted as a fractional spin Josephson effect that is

protected by the presence of the inversion symmetry.

To give estimates for the possible frequency shifts ,

let us consider the following experimentally pertinent val-

ues: 1 = 1.15, 2 = 1.1, R = 2.9,  = 1 meV  241 GHz, and S = 5/2. Interrogating the classical spin with

frequencies 0  25 GHz, results in   4.9 GHz, which is well within the state-of-the-art experimental res-

olution [72]. Note that with the above parameters, the

qubit splitting q  9.5 GHz, and thus the target spin precesses off-resonantly, which is essential for the non-

invasive read-out of the qubit.

FIG. 5: Sketch of the hybrid YSR qubit (YSRQ) - Majorana qubit (MQ). The magnetic adatoms (black arrows) deposited on the top of an s-wave SC form three Shiba chains in a T-junction geometry. The left (l) and right (r) chains are assumed topological, hosting Majorana zero modes i (i = 1, . . . , 4) at their ends (red) and are coupled via tunnelings tl,r to a spin dimer that accommodates a YSRQ (green), while the lower Shiba chain is non-topological. The states of the MQ are defined by the fermionic occupations nl(r) = 0, 1 of the two Majorana modes on the left (right) chain, and the topologically protected Clifford gates can be implemented by braiding [steps (1), (2), and (3)] and fusing the Majorana zero modes. Driving locally the dimer rotates coherently the YSRQ (see Sec. IV), and by combining this rotation with the SWAP gates facilitated by tl,r (described in detail in Ref. [94]) the missing /8 phase gate can be implemented. The SWAP gate can also be used for the measurement of the MQ via the readout of the YSRQ.

on top of superconductors that can be addressed individually. More importantly, they could be integrated with Majorana zero modes hosted at the ends of spin chains in superconductors and exploited for performing universal quantum computation. Indeed, the braiding statistics of the Majorana zero modes alone is not sufficient for implementing a universal set of topological gate operations necessary for quantum computation, and additional nontopological gates are needed to achieve universality. The best way to implement the missing /8 phase gate is to control the couplings of the Majorana zero modes [88], e. g. by varying the magnetic fluxes in transmon geometries [23, 89, 90], and extremely robust geometric [91] and distillation [92] protocols can be utilized if sufficiently accurate control of the couplings is possible. However, it is not easy to realize suitable pulses to control the couplings of the Majorana modes in Shiba chains, and to our knowledge there currently does not exist proposals for robust protocols to implement the /8 gate in these systems. An alternative proposal to implement the /8 gate is to integrate the Majorana zero modes with quantum dots-based qubits [24, 93, 94], and here we show that this idea can be transferred to the context of the Shiba chains by utilizing the YSR qubit.
In Fig. 5 we sketch our proposal for generating a universal set of gates in a hybrid YSR qubit (YSRQ) and

8

the Majorana qubit (MQ) system. A T-junction formed by three Shiba chains generated by magnetic impurities (or adatoms) placed on top of an s-wave superconductor interacts via tunnelings tl,r with a spin dimer that encodes a YSRQ described in the previous sections. The left and right Shiba chains are topological, hosting Majorana zero modes i = i (i = 1, . . . , 4), while the lower one is in the trivial regime. Two Majorana zero modes on the left (right) chain define a fermionic state, which can be occupied or empty. Thus, the states of the MQ can be encoded either as {|0l0r , |1l1r } (in the case of even parity) or as {|0l1r , |1l0r } (odd parity).
The hybrid qubit can be operated as suggested in Ref. [94]. The Clifford gates can be implemented in a topologically protected fashion by fusing Majorana zero modes and by braiding them in a T-junction shown in Fig. 5 [22]. Additionally, the non-topological /8 gate can be performed by first swapping the MQ state to YSRQ, then performing the /8 gate on the YSRQ, and finally swapping the YSRQ state back onto the MQ. The SWAP gate can be constructed by utilizing the general ideas presented in Ref. [94]. The tunable couplings tl,r lead to a interaction Hamiltonian between the qubits

Hint(t) =

Jij (t)iMj ,

i,j=x,y,z

(16)

where Mj (j = x, y, z) are the Pauli matrices acting on the MQ and Jij(t) are time-dependent coupling strengths originating from tl, tr = 0. In the case of q = 0 (degenerate YSRQ qubit), a specific sequence of operations
for implementing the SWAP gate has been provided in
Ref. [94]. In our case q = 0 can be achieved easily in the anti-parallel configuration by applying a magnetic field
Bz along z-axis. Indeed, for  =  the tunneling vanishes, and we get that q = 0 at gµBBz = 2 with g and µB being the g-factor and the Bohr magneton, respectively.
Moreover, since we are assuming the deep Shiba limit
( 1), the condition gµBBz 1 is satisfied, which means the bulk SC remains unaffected. Alternatively, it
might be possible to utilize the dynamics of the classi-
cal spin in the implementation of the SWAP gate. The
SWAP gate can also be used for the initialization and
measurement of the MQ via the readout of the YSRQ.

VII. DISCUSSION
In this work, we introduced and studied a novel type of quantum bit, the YSR qubit, that is encoded in the energy states of a spin dimer coupled to an s-wave superconductor. We have demonstrated theoretically that both the coherent manipulation and the readout of the YSR qubit can be efficiently implemented by harnessing the dynamics of the spins that engenders it. Furthermore, we scrutinized the effect of the classical spins fluctuations on the coherence of the YSR qubit, and showed robust behaviour compared to the manipulation times.

Given the ability to manipulate magnetic adatoms on superconducting substrates with a high degree of control, the YSR qubit could be utilised together with Majorana topological qubits to facilitate performing universal quantum computation. We proposed one such hybrid implementation that is based on topological Shiba chains and a spin dimer hosting the YSR qubit.
There are several avenues for future studies. An immediate objective would be to generalize the time-dependent formalism described here to account for the spin-orbit effects originating from both the substrate [68] and the anisotropy of the exchange coupling between the classical spins and the superconducting electrons [67]. The spinorbit coupling effects can provide the microscopic mechanism for the easy-axis anisotropy and therefore they are potentially useful for the operation of the YSR qubit, but additionally they can stabilize the ferromagnetic order in adatom chains and facilitate the realization of the Majorana modes. Thus, these effects are crucial for the operation of the hybrid qubit.
Another important direction is to establish the Hamiltonian of the hybrid qubit from the microscopics in order to study the possible quantum gates and to optimally engineer the adatom deposition. Additionally, transferring coherently the information between the two types of qubits might be beneficial for entangling MQs which are separated by a large distance. The YSRQs could be entangled for example by utilizing cavity quantum electrodynamics similarly as it has been employed in various other solid-state qubits [75]. While the coupling of the YSR qubit to the magnetic field of a microwave cavity should be weak (< kHz), the stronger electric field component instead could couple to the qubit by affecting the tunneling th or via the spin-orbit coupling. Alternatively, thes interactions could be ignited indirectly, via the coupling of the quantum fluctuations of the classical spins to the microwave photons [51, 95], which could also be used to drive them into precession. Moreover, such setups would naturally allow for the YSRQ to interact with other types of qubits, and enhance their functionality.
Further down the road, it would be interesting to extend the dynamical framework describing the spin dimers also to Shiba chains and 2D Shiba islands that can host Majorana end modes and chiral Majorana edges [58, 96], respectively. We believe that by triggering the magnetic dynamics it should be possible to both manipulate and detect the Majorana edge modes, the latter by leaving their fingerprints on the STM-ESR signals. Moreover, such approaches should be advantageous as they would allow to interrogate Shiba systems with well established methods from spintronics [97]. As catalyst for another direction of future work, we speculate that the in-gap Shiba states, either in dimers or chains, could mediate out-of-equilibrium spin interactions in the presence of external magnetic drives that have no counterparts in the static situations. Given the non-perturbative nature of the coupling between the electrons in the superconductor and the spins, which converts into torques as in Eq. (15),

9

that would require solving self-consistently the combined dynamics of the two systems. This might result in novel spin configurations that are stabilized dynamically and, on the electronic side, induce new types of (possibly dissipative) phases [98].
In conclusion, the YSR qubit proposed in this work operates well within the current experimental capabilities, and we expect to open up new possibilities for fu-

ture studies on superconducting systems patterned with spins. We hope our findings will help create a roadmap towards a functional MQ in these systems.

Supplementary material for "A Yu-Shiba-Rusinov qubit"

A. Derivation of the low-energy Hamiltonian

In this section we show the derivation of the Hamiltonian describing the YSR qubit given by Eq. (7). The total SC Hamiltonian written in the Nambu basis (r) = c(r), c(r), c(r), - c(r) T reads

Htot(t)

=

1 2

dr (r)HBdG(t)(r) ,

(17)

where, as described in the main text [Eq. (1)], the BdG Hamiltonian is

HBdG(t) = H0 +

Vj(t)(r - Rj) ,

(18)

j=1,2

H0 = pz + x ,

Vj(t) = JjSj(t) ·  ,

(19)

while Si(t) = S(sin i cos i, sin i sin i, cos i), with i and i being the (time-dependent) polar angles for spin

i = 1, 2. The time dependent Schrodinger equation can be written as it(r, t) = HBdG(r, t). By using the Fourier

decomposition

(r, t)

=

1 Ld

k e-ik·r(k, t), we can recast the BdG equation in the following form:

i

 t

-

H0(k)

(k, t) =

Vj (t)(rj , t)eik·rj ,

(20)

j=1,2

which, in the static limit pertains to the substitution it  E and coincides with the equation for the spectrum presented in Ref. [41]. In the frequency domain, and retaining only the leading order terms in , we obtain:

(ri, )  -

[( + x)I0(rj - ri) + I1(rj - ri)z] d Vj( )(rj,  -  )eik·rj ,

(21)

j=1,2

where

;

I1(r)  I1(r) =

dk (2)d

k eik·r

2 k

+

.

(22)

In the above expressions, we retained only the leading order corrections in , assuming that the time dynamics of
the classical spins as well as that of the emerging Shiba energies is such that   (adiabatic regime). For a 2D superconductor the integrals I0,1(r) can be written as I0(r) = (20/)I~0(r) and I1(r) = 20I~1(r) [41], where

I~0(1)(r) = Im(Re) K0

(23)

0 is the density of states, kF the Fermi momentum, vF the Fermi velocity and K0 is the modified Bessel function of second kind. At r = 0 they give I~0 = 2 and I~1 = 0, while for kF r 1 (a limit utilised throughout our work) the asymptotic expressions are [41]

I~0(r) 

2 sin (kF r + /4) e-r/vF ,



kF r

I~1(r) 

2 cos (kF r + /4) e-r/vF .



kF r

(24)

Next we switch back to the time-domain, and we get

(ri, t)  - [(it + x)I~0(rj - ri) + I~1(rj - ri)z]Vj(t)(rj, t) .

(25)

j=1,2

Defining ~(ri, t) = i(ri, t), we can manipulate further this expression by writing the combined evolution as:

i

 t

~(r1, t) ~(r2, t)

=

H1(t) HT (t) HT (t) H2(t)

~(r1, t) ~(r2, t)

,

(26)

14

where

Hi(t) = -

ni ·  i

+

x

+ (ni × n i) ·  ,

(27)

HT (t) = -(n1 · )(n2 · )[I~0(R)x + I~1(R)z] ,

(28)

and ni  ni(t) = Si(t)/Si. As mentioned in the main text, the dynamics of the spins induce an extra term in the local Hamiltonian matrix element of Berry phase origin. Without this term, the transverse spin expectation values at the positions of the impurities would have the wrong sign.
To help distinguish the low and high energy sectors, which in turn will allow us to eliminate perturbatively the terms that couple them, it is instructive to perform first a unitary transformation U0 = exp (iy/4) that converts x  z, followed by a (time-dependent) Ui(t) = 0  U~i(t) that acts on site i = 0(R) and diagonalises the terms  ni · :

U~i(t) =

cos i/2

sin i/2

eii sin i/2 -eii cos i/2

.

(29)

These rotations affect the terms in Eq. (28) and they become:

Hi(t) = U~iHi(t)U~i - iU~iU~ i = -

,

HT (t) = U~1HT (t)U~2 = - U1(n1 · )(n2 · )U2 [I~0(R)z - I~1(R)x] .

(30)

The low (high) 4 × 4 energy sector is spanned by the zz = -1(1) and the corresponding energies of the isolated Shiba states are ±(1 - 1/i) [±(1 + 1/i)]. Consequently, we can then project the remaining terms, i. e. the tunneling and the velocity contributions  i, i, onto the low-energy sector to obtain an effective time-dependent Hamiltonian.
To simplify the discussion, from here onward, we assume the left spin (1) is static and aligned along the z-direction, or 1, 1 = 0, and that 2   and 2  . Furthermore, we also consider that all lengths are expressed in terms of SC = vF /, and set  = 1. Then, the projected 4 × 4 low-energy Hamiltonian can be written as

Hl(t)  PlH~ (t)Pl = Hl,0(t) + Al,(t) + Al,(t) ,

(31)

where Pl is the corresponding projector while

represents the instantaneous projected Hamiltonian, with Al,(t) and Al,(t) being the projected gauge field terms associated with the  and  contributions in Eq. (30).

B. Effective qubit Hamiltonian

We can further diagonalize the instantaneous 4 × 4 Hamiltonian Hl,0(t) in order to identify the effective 2 × 2 YSR qubit Hamiltonian presented in the main text. That is achieved by another time-dependent unitary transformation

C± = C ± (1 - 2) ,

(34)

with s1 = sign[sin(kF R + /4)] and s2 = sign[cos(kF R + /4)]. Its effect on Hl(t) can be formally written as:

H~l(t) = U3Hl(t)U3 - iU3U 3 = H~l,0(t) + A~l,(t) + A~l,(t) ,

(35)

H~l,0(t) = U3Hl,0(t)U3 ; A~l,s(t) = U3Al,sU3 - iU3sU3 ,

(36)

with s = , . Note that while H~l,0(t) is now diagonal, with energies ±E1,2, where E1,2 = (B ± C)/(212), the gauge field terms can induce transitions between its eigenstates. More importantly, these terms have two separate
contributions: one from the initial gauge fields, originating from the first unitary transformations U1,2, and one from the diagonalization of the 4 × 4 effective (instantaneous) time-dependent Hamiltonian Hl,0(t). Both are required to correctly capture the low-energy sector dynamics, and starting from the static effective theory by turning the
parameters  and  time-dependent would lead to erroneous results.
In order to establish a qubit that is well separated from the excited states, we assume that both 1, 2 = 1, as well as th,  2min|1 - 1,2|, with  = |1 - 2|. Then, we can further project H~l(t) to the two lowest energy states, resulting in the qubit Hamiltonian presented in the main text (up to terms that act as identity in this subspace)

C. Details on the read out via torques

Here we provide details on the calculation of the torque  = -J1Sn1 × (0) acting on the precessing spin S1
by the SC electrons, and its effects on the STM-ESR signal. We first note that at the operator level, the torque can be written as ^ = -n1 × h^, where we introduced the magnetic field operator h^(t) = n1 Htot(t). Then, for a given many-body state |(t) that acts in the occupation number basis we have

h = (t)|h^|(t) = (t)|n1 Htot(t)|(t) .

(39)

For a static BdG Hamiltonian, we can write Htot = i i(ni)(ii - 1/2), with i(n1) being the BdG eigenvalues, and i (i) being the Bogoliubov annihilation (creation) operator found from diagonalization. Then, in such a case we obtain the average field:

h = h^ = (fi - 1/2)n1 i(n1) ,

(40)

i

with fi = ii being the occupation of state i. This encodes both the well-known RKKY interaction mediated by the bulk states, as well as the (static) YSR contribution [87]. Dynamics can induce transitions between different instantaneous energy levels, and in general a full diagonal form for the BdG Hamiltonian might not be found. However,

16

in our perturbative scheme in the dynamics, when q = 2z, we can neglect the transitions caused by x and y. Moreover, since 1 , the bulk states are also unaffected. Then, the many-body Hamiltonian is still diagonal, and the magnetic field reads:

h

n1 i(n1) +

(fi - 1/2)n1

(n1)



hbulk

(41)

where the first and second terms determine the bulk contribution (all levels i empty, or fi = 0) and YSR in-gap states

contributions, respectively. Importantly,

eff i

are

the

full

single-particle

energies

that

include

the

dynamics (which, in a more formal language, corresponds to Berry phase effects [65]). The YSR states that define

the qubit states correspond in the many-body picture to the configurations f1(2) = 0(1) and f1(2) = 1(0). Thus, the field for each qubit state is

with  = 0, 1. Consequently, one can find the corresponding torques from   = -n1 × h,  s = -n1 × n1 q and  d = -2n1 × n1 z, as presented in the main text (note that these are more general as they assume arbitrary changes in the angles  and ).
For the numerical evaluation of the torques we have employed a Green function approach that describes the dimer
when the target spin precesses circularly. In this case, an exact solution can be found, assuming (t) = t and
 =const, with  being the precession frequency. Indeed, the dynamical problem in Eq. (18) can be made static by rotating it with the time-dependent unitary transformation U (t) = e-i(/2)zt. In this frame, the stationary
Schrodinger equation from Eq. (18) can be written as

H~ BdG

-

(43)

where the second term acts as a fictitious magnetic field on the superconductor. Following Ref. 60, the wave-function at any point r can be written as, (r) = rj0,R G0(r - rj, E)Vj(rj), where

(E + /2)I0+ + I1+

I1±(r) =

.

(45)

We then get the following set of eigenvalue equations:

(1 - G0(0, E)V1) (0) = G0(R, E)V2(R) ,

(1 - G0(0, E)V2) (R) = G0(R, E)V1(0) ,

(46)

and the in-gap spectrum can be found numerically for arbitrary frequencies /2 < 1 from the 8 × 8 determinant

1 - G0(0, E)V1 G0(R, E)V2 G0(R, E)V1 1 - G0(0, E)V2

= 0.

(47)

Then, the associated torques (that include all orders in /2) can be evaluated as in the previous subsection. The plots depicted in Fig. 4 in the main text were obtained assuming the deep Shiba limit (1,2  1) and /2 1 (adiabatic driving), which is the relevant regime in this work. Nevertheless, this approach can be readily employed to study the
effects of the dynamics beyond the adiabatic realm.

D. Linearization of LLG equation and resonance frequency renormalization

The LLG equation describing the dynamics of the classical spin S1 in the presence of the torque   torque pertaining to the YSR qubit in state  = 0, 1 can be written as

S1(t) = -S1(t) × B(t) +  (t) + gS1 × S1 ,

(48)

17

where B(t) = B0z + B(t) is the external magnetic field, being the sum of a constant term along z which defines the bare resonance frequency 0 = B0, and a weak in-plane rf component. Specifically, we consider B(t) = B(cos(1t), sin(1t), 0) and B B0. In the stationary limit, the impurity spin can be written as S1(t) = Szz + S(t), with S(t) = S (cos(1t + ) , sin (1t + ), 0), where S = S sin   S and Sz = S cos   S, and  quantifies the lagging of the spin with respect to the driving field. In this limit, we can also expand the torque   in terms of the small parameter , which in turn gives [65]:

(49)

where s = (s/) |=0 and d = (b/) |=0 with b = (d/1) |1=0. From the above equations, we can readily evaluate both the amplitude S and the phase lag , respectively:

(52)

Note that each type of torque will also contain a constant contribution, independent of the qubit state, that originates from the (occupied) bulk states. Hence, we can write s  bs + s and d  bd + d, where the index b labels bulk contribution. Nevertheless, as showed in Ref. [87] the static bulk contribution is negligible for R  1, while as argued in Ref. [65], the dynamical contribution of the bulk states is negligible in the adiabatic regime. We can then extract the resonance frequency difference as

E. Manipulation of the YSR qubit: Rabi oscillations
1. Behavior of Rabi oscillation period around  = 0 and 
The Rabi frequency and hence, the time period of the Rabi oscillation is determined by x. Notably, the i terms are much weaker for deviation  around  = 0 as compared to such deviation around  =  making it inefficient for manipulation in the parallel configuration. In Fig. 6a we show x as a function of  near  = 0 and near , suggesting that x varies linearly (quadratically) around  =  ( = 0).

2. Numerical approach for qubit state evolution

The time evolution operator corresponding to the qubit Hamiltonian can be written as U (t, t0) = T e- i

, t
t0

dt

Hq (t

)

where T represents the time ordering operator. We have implemented the evolution of the qubit state by performing

time slicing with small increment t, so that the evolution operator during one slice can be expanded as U (t, t - t) =

1 - (i/ )Hq(t)t. Then, starting from the initial state |0 , the qubit state at time t can then be written as

|(t) = U (t, 0)|0 = U (t, t - t)U (t - t, t - 2t) · · · U (t, 0)|0 ,

(54)

which we evaluate numerically for |(t) by evolving the state under the sequence of pulses described in the main text.

Note that for these parameters, th/ = 0.34. (b) The probability amplitude of the qubit initialized in state |0 to remain in that state after time Ta, 0|(Ta) , in terms of Tq = / q for  = 0.05, or th/ = 0.34 (inset  = 0.01, or th/ = 1.75). The blue curve is the result obtained from the full numerical implementation of the evolution, while the red-dashed line is 0|(Ta) evaluated in the geometrical limit using Eq. (55). As Ta is increased, the full curve starts deviating from the geometric limit valid for Ta Tq, and reaches almost unity already for Ta  Tq, consistent with the adiabatic result. All plots are obtained using kF = 13.55.

3. Analytical approach for qubit state evolution in the geometric regime

The qubit state evolution subjected to the pulse (t) =  tanh(2t/Ta) can be studied analytically in two extreme limits: the adiabatic (Ta Tq) and geometric (Ta Tq) limit, respectively. In the adiabatic limit, the qubit evolution is trivial, as it remains in state |0 during the pulse. In the geometric limit, the energy splitting q becomes unimportant (thus can be neglected), and the qubit evolution is solely determined by yy  . Then, the evolution operator under
an arbitrary rotation of the qubit from  = 0 to a final 0 reads Ug(0) = e-i yydt  cos A(0) - i sin A(0) y, where

A(0) =

(55)

and thus the first pulse corresponds to 0 =  in the geometric limits. Fig: 6b shows the probability amplitude of the qubit state to be in |0 as a function of time Ta (scaled with Tq),
c0(Ta), starting from |0 . The blue solid line represents c0 evaluated numerically while the red dashed line corresponds to the geometric limit evaluated as c0 = cos A(). The deviation of the geometric amplitude from adiabatic result increases with decreasing , which is due to the effect of tunneling that makes it easier for the qubit to explore the
Bloch sphere. For  > q, the deviation is negligible and c0(Ta) depends weakly on the pulse length Ta. Thus, this situation is preferable for the qubit manipulation.

4. Geometric effects around  = 

The Rabi oscillations amplitude is also reduced because the geometric pulse (t) = ( - ) tanh(2t/Tb) leads to a probability amplitude c1 to excite the qubit from state |0 to state |1 . Assuming that th <  and  1, we obtain

c1

(56)

This linear increase of c1 with  shows good agreement with the full numerical results, as shown in Fig. 7 for various values of . In the limit th , c1  0 and the amplitude of Rabi oscillations approaches unity, as argued in the main text.

We see that for  such that th/  1, the weight c1 increases linearly with , matching well the geometric limit in Eq. (56), represented by the dashed lines, for a wide range of deviations .

F. Decoherence due to the Gilbert damping

Here we provide details on the decoherence of the YSR qubit by the stochastic fluctuations in the magnetic moments

orientations. The fluctuations of the spin k = 1, 2 can be accounted for by performing the substitution nk 

nk + nk(t), where nk(t) = ek,1nk,1 + ek,2nk,2  nk describe the induced fluctuations of the magnetic moment

perpendicular to the deterministic orientations nk. Here, ek,i and nk,i with i = 1, 2 label the orthogonal fluctuations

Then, the coupling between the qubit and the classical spins changes accordingly, V  V + V (t), with

where h^k is the magnetic field operator acting on the electrons. Projecting the above Hamiltonian onto the qubit subspace, leads to the following extra contribution:

Hq(t) =

k =1,2;=x,y,z

(58)

where k represent the components of the tensor coupling between the fluctuations and the qubit, and which can be extracted from above:

k

(59)

with the trace being taken over the qubit states. In the following, we assume the external driving is absent, and only focus on the static coherence properties. Then, we can evaluate explicitly the matrix elements of the field:

where the factor (-1)k reflects that the magnetic fields are opposite for given relative angles. Note that for  = 0, the diagonal terms vanish at both  = 0 and  = . From the above expressions, we can write the total magnetic field operator acting in the qubit subspace as:

h^qk = (-1)k

where x = x/ and y = y/ in the qubit Hamiltonian in Eq. (38). From here, the the matrix k can be readily

configurations, respectively. In the former case, the coupling to the magnetic fluctuations, while

is the effective coupling strength of the qubit to the fluctuations whose magnitude is dictated by the tunneling th. For this specific orientation, Eq. (58) becomes:

Hq(t) = gc (-1)k+1 [nk,2(t)x + nk,1(t)y] .

(64)

k

We are now in position to calculate the decoherence rates engendered by this coupling. We first introduce the noise power spectrum pertaining to the fluctuations nk(t) in the Fourier space:

Skk

()

=

1 2

dte-it nk,(t)nk ,(0) kk  Sk() ,

(65)

where the averages are taken over the thermal equilibrium, and we assumed the fluctuations of the two spins are not correlated. Within the Bloch-Redfield framework [83], the dephasing and the longitudinal relaxation rates read, respectively:

 =

(|1kz|2 + |2kz|2)S1k1(0) ,

k=1,2

1 =

k k¯ Sk ( q) ,

, k=1,2;=±

(66) (67)

where k± = kx ± iky. The pure dephasing rate  vanishes at both  = 0 and , and 1 = 0 at  = 0. The relaxation rate at  =  is

1 = 1/T1 = 2gc2

S1k1( q) + S1k1(- q) - i(S1k2(- q) - S1k2( q)) ,

k=1,2

(68)

while the dephasing time satisfies T2 = 2T1. In order to give estimates, we need to describe the noise spectrum of the magnetic fluctuations. To do that, we start by employing the stochastic LLG equation describing the magnets in the presence of magnetic noises (here we disregard the effect of the qubit on the dynamics, as it would only manifest in higher orders in the coupling):

n k = -nk × Bk,eff + Bk(t) + gnk × n k .

(69)

Here Bk,eff = --1FS(nk)/nk is the effective magnetic field acting on the impurity with FS(nk) being the kth classical spin free energy, and Bk(t) is the stochastic magnetic field whose Fourier components Bk,() with  = ek,1, ek,2 satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation relation [84]:

Bk,()Bk ,( )

(70)

S(, T )

In order to describe the experimental observations [85, 86], we assume z to be an easy-axis (the spin orients perpendicular to the surface), so that the free energy can be written as in the main text:

FS

(71)

where B = Bzz is external magnetic field along z and  is the strength of the anisotropy, which is assumed to be identical for the two spins. Consequently, the effective magnetic field that determines the dynamics can then
be written as Bk,eff = Bk,eff z, with the magnitude Bk,eff = Bz + (/)nk,z. For the anti-parallel alignment and

21

considering the deterministic direction of the spins to be along the z-axis, inserting the effective field in the LLG equation, we can extract the noise spectrum, for which we find

(72)

where k = 1, 2. To give some estimates, we assume 1 = 1.15, 2 = 1.1, R = 2.9, g = 0.001. Considering magnetization anisotropy energy  = 0.1 meV and 0 = 25 GHz, we find T2  7 µs allowing around 800 Rabi oscillations to be experimentally observable before the qubit is hampered by the decoherence stemming from magnetic
fluctuations. In the presence of a small applied magnetic field, say, Bz = 0.2 T which corresponds to 0 = 30.5 GHz, T2  4.5 µs allowing around 500 Rabi oscillations to be experimentally observable.
