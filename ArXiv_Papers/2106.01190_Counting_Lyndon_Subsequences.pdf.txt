Abstract
Counting substrings/subsequences that preserve some property (e.g., palindromes, squares) is an important mathematical interest in stringology. Recently, Glen et al. studied the number of Lyndon factors in a string. A string w = uv is called a Lyndon word if it is the lexicographically smallest among all of its conjugates vu. In this paper, we consider a more general problem "counting Lyndon subsequences". We show (1) the maximum total number of Lyndon subsequences in a string, (2) the expected total number of Lyndon subsequences in a string, (3) the expected number of distinct Lyndon subsequences in a string.
1 Introduction
A string x = uv is said to be a conjugate of another string y if y = vu. A string w is called a Lyndon word if it is the lexicographically smallest among all of its conjugates. It is also known that w is a Lyndon word iff w is the lexicographically smallest suffix of itself (excluding the empty suffix).
A factor of a string w is a sequence of characters that appear contiguously in w. A factor f of a string w is called a Lyndon factor if f is a Lyndon word. Lyndon factors enjoy a rich class of algorithmic and stringology applications including: counting and finding the maximal repetitions (a.k.a. runs) in a string [2] and in a trie [8], constant-space pattern matching [3], comparison of the sizes of run-length Burrows-Wheeler Transform of a sting and its reverse [4], substring minimal suffix queries [1], the shortest common superstring problem [7], and grammar-compressed self-index (Lyndon-SLP) [9].
Since Lyndon factors are important combinatorial objects, it is natural to wonder how many Lyndon factors can exist in a string. Regarding this question, the next four types of counting problems are interesting:
· MTF (, n): the maximum total number of Lyndon factors in a string of length n over an alphabet of size .
· MDF (, n): the maximum number of distinct Lyndon factors in a string of length n over an alphabet of size .
· ETF (, n): the expected total number of Lyndon factors in a string of length n over an alphabet of size .

· EDF (, n): the expected number of distinct Lyndon factors in a string of length n over an alphabet of size .
Glen et al. [5] were the first who tackled these problems, and they gave exact values for MDF (, n), ETF (, n), and EDF (, n). Using the number L(, n) of Lyndon words of length n over an alphabet of size , their results can be written as shown in Table 1.

Table 1: The numbers of Lyndon factors in a string of length n over an alphabet of size , where n = m + p with 0  p <  for MTF (, n) and MDF (, n).

The first contribution of this paper is filling the missing piece of Table 1, the exact value of MTF (, n), thus closing this line of research for Lyndon factors (substrings).
We then extend the problems to subsequences. A subsequence of a string w is a sequence of characters that can be obtained by removing 0 or more characters from w. A subsequence s of a string w is said to be a Lyndon subsequence if s is a Lyndon word. As a counterpart of the case of Lyndon factors, it is interesting to consider the next four types of counting problems of Lyndon subsequences:
· MTS (, n): the maximum total number of Lyndon subsequences in a string of length n over an alphabet of size .
· MDS (, n): the maximum number of distinct Lyndon subsequences in a string of length n over an alphabet of size .
· ETS (, n): the expected total number of Lyndon subsequences in a string of length n over an alphabet of size .
· EDS (, n): the expected number of distinct Lyndon subsequences in a string of length n over an alphabet of size .
Among these, we present the exact values for MTS (, n), ETS (, n), and EDS (, n). Our results are summarized in Table 2.
The exact value for MDS (, n) is left open for future work.
2 Preliminaries
2.1 Strings
Let  = {a1, . . . , a} be an ordered alphabet of size  such that a1 < . . . < a. An element of  is called a string. The length of a string w is denoted by |w|. The empty string  is a string of length 0. Let + be the set of non-empty strings, i.e., + =  - {}. The i-th character of a string w is denoted by w[i], where 1  i  |w|. For a string w and two integers 1  i  j  |w|, let w[i..j] denote the substring of w that begins at position i and ends at position j. For convenience, let w[i..j] =  when i > j. A string x is said to be a subsequence of a string w if there exists a set

of positions {i1, . . . , i|x|} (1  i1 < . . . < i|x|  |w|) such that x = w[i1] · · · w[i|x|]. We say that a subsequence x occurs at {i1, . . . , i|x|} (1  i1 < . . . < i|x|  |w|) if x = w[i1] · · · w[i|x|].

2.2 Lyndon words

A string x = uv is said to be a conjugate of another string y if y = vu. A string w is called a Lyndon word if it is the lexicographically smallest among all of its conjugates. Equivalently, a string w is said to be a Lyndon word, if w is lexicographically smaller than all of its non-empty proper suffixes.
Let µ be the M¨obius function on the set of positive integers defined as follows.

3 Maximum total number of Lyndon subsequences

Let MTS (, n) be the maximum total number of Lyndon subsequences in a string of length n over an alphabet  of size . In this section, we determine MTS (, n).
Theorem 1. For any  and n such that  < n,
MTS (, n) = 2n - (p + )2m + n +  + 1

where n = m + p (0  p < ). Moreover, the number of strings that contain MTS (, n) Lyndon

subsequences is

 p

,

and

the

following

string

w

is

one

of

such

strings;

w = a1m · · · a-pma-p+1m+1 · · · am+1.

Proof. Consider a string w of the form

w = a1k1 a2k2 · · · ak

where

 i=1

ki

=

n

and

ki



0

for

any

i.

For

any

subsequence

x

of

w,

x

is

a

Lyndon

word

if

x

is

not a unary string of length more than 2. It is easy to see that this form is a necessary condition

3

for the maximum number ( there exist several non-Lyndon subsequences if w[i] > w[j] for some i < j). Hence, the number of Lyndon subsequences of w can be represented as







(2n - 1) - (2ki - 1 - ki) = 2n - 1 - 2ki + ki + 

i=1

i=1

i=1


= 2n - 1 - 2ki + n + .

i=1

This formula is maximized when

 i=1

2ki

is

minimized.

It

is

known

that

2a + 2b > 2a-1 + 2b+1

holds for any integer a, b such that a  b + 2. From this fact,

 i=1

2ki

is

minimized

when

the

difference of ki and kj is less than or equal to 1 for any i, j. Thus, if we choose p ki's as m + 1, and

set m for other ( - p) ki's where n = m + p (0  p < ), then

 i=1

2ki

is

minimized.

Hence,


min(2n - 1 - 2ki + n + ) = 2n - 1 - p · 2m+1 - ( - p)2m + n + 

i=1
= 2n - (p + )2m + n +  - 1

Moreover, one of such strings is

a1m · · · a-pma-p+1m+1 · · · am+1.

Therefore, this theorem holds.

We can apply the above strategy to the version of substrings. Namely, we can also obtain the following result.

Corollary 2. Let MTF (, n) be the maximum total number of Lyndon substrings in a string of length n over an alphabet of size . For any  and n such that  < n,

MTF (, n) =

n 2

- ( - p)

m+1 2

-p

m+2 2

+n

where n = m + p (0  p < ). Moreover, the number of strings that contain MTF (, n) Lyndon

subsequences is

 p

,

and

the

following

string

w

is

one

of

such

strings;

w = a1m · · · a-pma-p+1m+1 · · · am+1.

Proof. In a similar way to the above discussion, the number of Lyndon substrings of w can be represented as

n+1 2


-

i=1

ki + 1 2

- ki

=

n+1 2


-

ki + 1 2

+ n.

i=1

We can use the following inequation that holds for any a, b such that a  b + 2;

a 2

+

b 2

>

a-1 2

+

b+1 2

.

Then,

min holds.

Finally, we give exact values MTS (, n) for several conditions in Table 3.

4 Expected total number of Lyndon subsequences

Let TS (, n) be the total number of Lyndon subsequences in all strings of length n over an
alphabet  of size . In this section, we determine the expected total number ETS (, n) of
Lyndon subsequences in a string of length n over an alphabet  of size , namely, ETS (, n) = TS (, n)/n.

Theorem 3. For any  and n such that  < n,

n
TS (, n) =
m=1

L(, m)

n m

n-m

.

Moreover, ETS (, n) = TS (, n)/n.

Proof. Let Occ(w, x) be the number of occurrences of subsequence x in w, and L(, n) the set of Lyndon words of length less than or equal to n over an alphabet of size . By a simple observation, TS (, n) can be written as

TS (, n) =

Occ(w, x).

xL(,n) wn

Firstly, we consider wn Occ(w, x) for a Lyndon word x of length m. Let {i1, . . . , im} be a set

of m positions in a string of length n where 1  i1 < . . . < im  n. The number of strings that

contain x as a subsequence at {i1, . . . , im} is n-m. In addition, the number of combinations of

m positions is

n m

.

Hence,

wn Occ(w, x) =

n m

n-m.

This

implies

that

n
TS (, n) =
m=1

L(, m)

n m

n-m

.

Therefore, this theorem holds.

Finally, we give exact values TS (, n), ETS (, n) for several conditions in Table 4.

5 Expected number of distinct Lyndon subsequences

Let TDS (, n) be the total number of distinct Lyndon subsequences in all strings of length n
over an alphabet  of size . In this section, we determine the expected number EDS (, n) of distinct Lyndon subsequences in a string of length n over an alphabet  of size , namely, EDS (, n) = TDS (, n)/n.

Theorem 4. For any  and n such that  < n,

n
TDS (, n) =

n
L(, m)

n k

( - 1)n-k

.

m=1

k=m

Moreover, EDS (, n) = TDS (, n)/n.

To prove this theorem, we introduce the following lemmas.

Lemma 5. For any x1, x2  m and m, n (m  n), the number of strings in n which contain x1 as a subsequence is equal to the number of strings in n which contain x2 as a subsequence.
of Lemma 5. Let C (n, , x) be the number of strings in n which contain a string x as a subsequence. We prove C (n, , x1) = C (n, , x2) for any x1, x2  m by induction on the length m.
Suppose that m = 1. It is clear that the set of strings which contain x   is n - ( - {x})n, and C (n, , x) = n - ( - 1)n. Thus, C (n, , x1) = C (n, , x2) for any x1, x2 if |x1| = |x2| = 1.
Suppose that the statement holds for some k  1. We prove C (n, , x1) = C (n, , x2) for any x1, x2  k+1 by induction on n. If n = k + 1, then C (n, , x1) = C (n, , x2) = 1. Assume that the statement holds for some   k + 1. Let x = yc be a string of length k + 1 such that y  k, c  . Each string w of length  + 1 which contains x as a subsequence satisfies either

· w[1..] contains x as a subsequence, or

· w[1..] does not contain x as a subsequence.

The number of strings w in the first case is  ·C (j, , yc). On the other hand, the number of strings w in the second case is C (, , y) - C (, , yc). Hence, C ( + 1, , x) = C (, , yc) + C (, , y) -
C (, , yc). Let x1 = y1c1 and x2 = y2c2 be strings of length k + 1. By an induction hypothesis, C (, , y1c1) = C (, , y2c2) and C (, , y1) = C (, , y2) hold. Thus, C ( + 1, , x1) = C ( + 1, , x2) also holds.
Therefore, this lemma holds.

Then, we can obtain Theorem 4 as follows.

of Theorem 4. Thanks to Lemma 6, the number of strings of length n which contain a Lyndon

word of length m is also
