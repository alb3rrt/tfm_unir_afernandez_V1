## Abstract

Let $H_{s,k}$ be the graph defined by intersecting $s$ triangles and $k$ cycles of odd lengths at least five in exactly one common vertex. Recently, Hou, Qiu and Liu [Discrete Math. 341 (2018) 126--137], and Yuan [J. Graph Theory 89 (2018), no. 1, 26--39] determined independently the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph that does not contain $H_{s,k}$ as a subgraph. In this paper, we determine the graphs of order $n$ that attain the maximum spectral radius among all graphs containing no $H_{s,k}$ for $n$ large enough.

## Comments

22 pages. In the end of this paper, we raised some open problems. For example, maximizing the largest signless Laplacian spectral radius. In the forthcoming paper, the first author (joint with Dheer Noal Desai and Michael Tait) shall prove the extremal spectral problem involving the intersecting cliques. I here announce our result in advance. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1911.13082 by other authors
