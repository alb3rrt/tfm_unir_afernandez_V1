## Abstract

This work evaluates the performance and energy efficiency for a well-known set of regular and irregular HPC benchmarks, using an integrated GPU and CPU. Experimental results show that co-execution is worthwhile when using dynamic algorithms, improving efficiency even more when using unified shared memory.
