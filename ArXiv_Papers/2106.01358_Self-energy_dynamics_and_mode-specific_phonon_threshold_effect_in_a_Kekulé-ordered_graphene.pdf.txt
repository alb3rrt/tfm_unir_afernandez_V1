Electron-phonon interaction and related self-energy are fundamental to both the equilibrium properties and non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics of solids. Although electron-phonon interaction has been suggested by various time-resolved measurements to be important for the relaxation dynamics of graphene, the lack of energy- and momentum-resolved self-energy dynamics prohibits direct identification of the role of specific phonon modes in the relaxation dynamics. Here by performing time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy mea-

surements on a Kekule´-ordered graphene with folded Dirac cones at the  point, we have succeeded in resolving the self-energy effect induced by coupling of electrons to two phonons at 1 = 177 meV and 2 = 54 meV and revealing its dynamical change in the time domain. Moreover, these strongly coupled phonons define energy thresholds, which separate the hierarchical relaxation dynamics from ultrafast, fast to slow, thereby providing direct experimental evidence for the dominant role of mode-specific phonons in the relaxation dynamics.

Electron-phonon interaction is ubiquitous in solids and fundamental to the transport properties 1,2 as well as the non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics. Electron-phonon interaction determines the electrical resistivity of metals 1,2, affects the electron mobility of semiconductors, and drives phase transitions such as charge density wave 3, superconductivity 4,5. Electron-phonon interaction also plays a critical role in the non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics, as has been revealed by various time-resolved optical measurements, where the relaxation rate of electrons is determined by the electron-phonon coupling strength averaged over all phonons 6­9. In order to further identify whether the relaxation dynamics is dominantly determined by specific phonon modes that are strongly coupled with electrons or contributed by all phonons, it is important to experimentally resolve the self-energy  in the time domain and reveal its dynamic evolution. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a powerful tool for extracting the real and imaginary parts of the self-energy Re and |Im|, which show up in the ARPES data as a renormalization of the electronic dispersion 2 and an increase of the scattering rate near the phonon energy. By combining ARPES with ultrafast pump-probe, time-resolved ARPES (TrARPES) provides unique opportunities for revealing the self-energy effect in the time domain with mode-specific information and establishing a direct connection between the strongly coupled phonons and the relaxation dynamics.
Graphene with low-energy excitations resembling relativistic Dirac fermions 10,11 and strong electron-phonon coupling indicated by Kohn anomaly 12 is a model system for investigating the electron-phonon interaction in both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium states. Electron-phonon coupling induced self-energy effect has been resolved in ARPES measurements of graphene and

graphite 13­19 and suggested to be important for the carrier relaxation from time-resolved optical measurements 20­22. While TrARPES measurements have been performed to reveal the relaxation dynamics of photo-excited carriers 23­35, so far, the electron-phonon coupling induced self-energy effect and the associated self-energy dynamics have not been resolved in any TrARPES measurement of graphene or graphite yet. Experimentally, this is limited by the reduced efficiency and resolution of the high harmonic generation (HHG) light source 35­37, which is required for generating a sufficiently high photon energy to probe the Dirac cone at the K point with a large momentum value of 1.7 A° -1.
Here by taking an experimental strategy of folding the Dirac cones from K to  by inducing  a ( 3 × 3)R30 (Fig. 1(a)) Kekule´ order 38,39 through Li intercalation 40­42, we are able to probe the dynamics of Dirac cones using 6.2 eV photon energy with greatly improved momentum resolution. This leads to successful identification of coupling of electrons to phonons at 1 = 177 meV and 2 = 54 meV in both Re and |Im| in the time domain. Moreover, these two strongly coupled phonons dominate the relaxation dynamics of electrons by setting energy thresholds for the hierarchical relaxation dynamics from ultrafast, fast to slow. Our work reveals the dynamical modification of the electron-phonon coupling induced self-energy effect in the time domain and highlights the dominant role of mode-specific electron-phonon interaction in the non-equilibrium dynamics.
The Kekule´-ordered graphene sample is obtained by intercalating Li 40­42 into a bilayer graphene sample grown on SiC substrate. The intercalation releases the bonding between the buffer
5

layer and SiC substrate 43, resulting in three weakly interacting graphene layers in AA stacking as schematically shown Fig. 1(a). The electronic structure of a Kekule´-ordered bilayer graphene has been investigated recently where experimental evidence of chiral symmetry breaking has been provided 42. In this work, we focus on the electronic dynamics of the folded Dirac cones at the  point by TrARPES measurements using 6.2 eV laser source with a higher repetition rate, which leads to a much higher experimental efficiency and at least three times improvement in the momentum resolution (see more information about resolution in methods and Supplementary Fig. S1) compared to previous TrARPES measurements with HHG light source. Such improvement is critical for successfully resolving the self-energy effect in the TrARPES measurements.
Figure 1(b) shows the Fermi surface map measured by a Helium lamp source, which contains three large Fermi pockets (indicated by ,  and , and colored curves) with different sizes around each Brillouin zone (BZ) corner. The large pocket size indicates large electron doping induced by
 the intercalated Li. Folded Dirac cones by the ( 3 × 3)R30 Kekule´ superlattice are observed at the  point similar to previous work 42, and these folded pockets are better resolved in the zoom-in Fermi surface map measured by using 6.2 eV laser source (Fig. 1(c)). We note that Li-intercalated monolayer graphene does not show folded Dirac cones at the  point 43, and the Li-intercalated trilayer graphene sample shows a much stronger intensity for the folded pockets at the  point than the Li-intercalated bilayer graphene sample 42. Therefore, a Li-intercalated trilayer graphene sample is used in this TrARPES study. Considering that the Li-intercalated samples are arranged in the AA stacking with weak interlayer coupling, the physics of Li-intercalated trilayer and bilayer graphene is expected to be similar.

The high-resolution ARPES data allow to resolve the electron-phonon coupling induced selfenergy effects in the folded Dirac cones at the  point. Figure 2(a) shows the three-dimensional band structure measured by the laser source with sharp dispersions, and a kink (indicated by the red arrow) is observed in the dispersion along the -K (-M) direction (labeled by red broken line in Fig. 2(a)) for the  pocket. The kink is more clearly resolved in the dispersion image in Fig. 2(b). By fitting the momentum distribution curves (MDCs) in Fig. 2(c), we extract the dispersion (black curve in Fig. 2(d)) and the peak width, which can be converted into Re and |Im| using standard ARPES analysis 13. Re is extracted by assuming a linear bare band dispersion (dotted line in Fig. 2(d)). A peak at -1 (red arrow in Fig. 2(e)) and a shoulder at -2 (black arrow) is observed, which is accompanied by an increase of the scattering rate in |Im| (Fig. 2(f)), and possible coupling to an additional phonon at 3 (gray arrow)) is also observed. Further fitting of the Eliashberg function gives the phonon energy of 1 = 177 ± 1 meV and 2 = 54 ± 4 meV (see detailed analysis in Supplementary Fig. S2). We note that electron-phonon coupling has been reported and suggested to be important for superconducting CaC6 17,18 or Li decorated graphene samples 19,44. Here, the high data quality by laser source allows to resolve fine structures in the self-energy, indicating coupling of electrons to multiple phonons. Such mode-specific electronphonon interaction lays an important foundation for further investigating the role of these phonons in the relaxation dynamics.
The electron dynamics is revealed by comparing dispersion images measured at different delay times with a pump photon energy of 1.55 eV at a pump fluence of 215 µJ/cm2. Figure 3(a-d) shows dispersion images measured at 0.7, 1.1, 1.6 and 4.2 ps after pump excitation respectively,

and the extracted dispersions at different delay times are plotted in Fig. 3(e). The spectral weight redistribution with an increase of intensity above EF (red color) indicating photo-excited electrons above EF and a suppression of intensity below EF (blue color) indicating photo-excited holes below EF is clearly resolved in the differential images shown in Fig. 3(f-i) after subtracting the dispersion image measured at -2.1 ps. In contrast to previous TrARPES studies where the TrARPES signal is widely spread out in a large energy range of approximately 1 eV 23­30,32, our TrARPES signal is mostly confined in a much smaller energy range within 177 meV (indicated by red arrows) with a much stronger TrARPES signal observed within 54 meV (gray arrows), indicating energy threshold effect in the TrARPES signal and the relaxation dynamics. Such energy threshold effect with TrARPES signal confined within 177 meV is ubiquitous across the entire BZ (see more data in a larger momentum space in Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition, the differential images in Fig. 3(f-i) show an unusual fine feature indicated by red arrows around -1 with an increase of intensity (red color) at the negative side of the peak and a decrease of intensity at the positive side (blue color), indicating a modification of dispersions measured at different delay times. The zoomin dispersions in Fig. 3(j) further reveal the dynamical modification of the dispersion near the kink energy at different delay times (see Supplementary Fig. S4 for a detailed analysis of the self-energy at -2.1 ps and 0.7 ps). At later delay time, the dispersion almost recovers (see comparison of blue curve at -4.2 ps and black curve at -2.1 ps in the inset of Fig. 3(j)).
To further reveal the underlying physics behind the dynamical change of the dispersion in the time domain, we show in Fig. 4 an analysis of Re and |Im| at different delay times. A decrease of the peak is observed in Re in Fig. 4(a) and the zoom-in Re near the kink energy in

Fig. 4(b), which gradually recovers at a later delay time (from orange to blue curves in Fig. 4(b)). A corresponding change is also observed in |Im| (pointed by black open arrows in Fig. 4(c)), which is related to Re by the Kramers-Kronig relationship. To check if the electron-phonon coupling induced self-energy effect is correlated with the pump-induced spectral weight transfer revealed in Fig. 3(f-i), we show in Fig. 4(d) a comparison of the temporal evolution of the pump induced change in the self-energy -Re (red symbol) and the electron population above EF which is obtained by integrating the TrARPES intensity from 0 to 50 meV (black symbols and dotted curve). The same temporal evolution suggests a correlation between the dynamical selfenergy and the pump-induced spectral weight redistribution and the corresponding change in the scattering phase space 45,46. In the equilibrium state (Fig. 4(e)), the scattering rate for electrons (holes) inside the phonon energy window (±1, 0) 1/2 is much less than that outside this window 1/1 due to the insufficient energy to emit a phonon at 1, as is indicated by the jump in |Im| (Fig. 2(f)). Upon pump excitation, electrons are populated above the Fermi energy EF and holes below EF (indicated by gray and white balls on the red curve in Fig. 4(f)), therefore, the scattering rate for holes (or electrons) inside the phonon window (1/2) increases due to an increase in the scattering phase space to scatter into, while that outside the phonon window (1/1) decreases. Such change of the scattering rate by the photon-induced spectral weight redistribution leads to a dynamical modification of the |Im| in Fig. 4(c) and Re in Fig. 4(b), implying the significant role of the phonons that are coupled to electrons.
The electron-phonon interaction not only modifies the self-energy in the time domain, but also sets energy thresholds as indicated by red and gray arrows in Fig. 3(f-i) and its relation to

the relaxation dynamics is further revealed in Fig. 5. The temporal evolution as a function of energy and delay time (Fig. 5(a)) and the selected curves at different energies (Fig. 5(b)) reveal hierarchical relaxation times in different energy windows defined by the two strongly-coupled phonons, which are summarized below: (1) for energy windows ±(, 1) in which photo-excited carriers have sufficient energy to emit phonons both at 1 and 2, the relaxation is "ultrafast" faster than 337 fs (see Supplementary Fig. S5 for a detailed analysis of energy-dependent relaxation time) and there is negligible TrARPES signal; (2) for energy windows ±(1, 2) in which photo-excited carriers can emit phonons at 2 but not 1, the relaxation is "fast", within a few hundred fs (curves at e1 and e4 in Fig. 5(b)); (3) for energy windows ±(2, 0) in which the relaxation requires involvement of acoustic phonons at even lower energy, the relaxation is "slow" with an additional component persisting beyond 7 ps (highlighted by red and blue shadings for curves e2 and e3 in Fig. 5(b)) which involves relaxation through other mechanism, e.g. acoustic phonons. The observation of distinct relaxation time scales in different energy regimes ±(, 1), ±(1, 2) and ±(2, 0) establishes a direct correlation between the hierarchical relaxation times and the two strongly coupled phonons at ±(1, 0) and ±(2, 0). Therefore, our results show that the coupled phonons 1 and 2 play a dominant role in the relaxation of electrons in graphene. Theoretical calculations of the phonon dispersion and electron-phonon coupling strength for the Li-intercalated graphene (see Supplementary for details of the calculation and Fig. S6 for more data) have identified that the two phonons 1 and 2 that are coupled to electrons and thereby dominate the relaxation dynamics are the in-plane TO phonon A1g (Fig. 5(c)) and the out-of-plane ZA phonon (Fig. 5(d)).
14

To summarize, by strategically folding the Dirac cones to  (Fig. 5(e)), high-resolution TrARPES measurements allow to visualize the coupling of electrons to two strongly coupled phonon modes in the time domain. The electron-phonon interaction not only modifies the electron self-energy, but also sets energy thresholds with hierarchical relaxation dynamics as schematically illustrated in Fig. 5(f). Our work not only provides direct experimental evidence for the dominant role of mode-specific phonons in the relaxation dynamics of a Kekule´-ordered graphene, but also provides a new material platform for exploring the engineering of Dirac cones by light-matter interaction.
Methods
Sample preparation Bilayer graphene was grown by flash annealing the Si face of 6H-SiC(0001) substrates in ultrahigh vacuum. Lithium intercalation was performed by in situ deposition of Li from an alkali metal dispenser (SAES), with the graphene sample maintained at 320 K 42. The intercalation process was monitored by low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and ARPES measurements. The intercalation releases the buffer layer 43 underneath the bilayer graphene, eventually resulting in a Kekule´-ordered trilayer graphene with Li atoms inserted between the graphene layers.
TrARPES measurements TrARPES measurements were performed in the home laboratory at Tsinghua University at 80 K in a working vacuum better than 6 × 10-11 Torr. The pump photon energy is 1.55 eV and the pump fluence was set to 215 µJ/cm2. Pulsed laser source at 6.2 eV with a pulse duration of 130 fs and repetition rate of 3.8 MHz is used as the probe source. The overall
15

time resolution was set to 480 fs. The Fermi edge of the graphene sample measured at 80 K shows an energy width of 33 meV, from which the overall instrumental energy resolution is extracted to be 16 meV after removing the thermal broadening (see more details in Supplementary Fig. S1). Moreover, the reduction of photon energy compared to HHG also leads to major improvement in the momentum resolution. Since the momentum resolution at the Fermi energy EF is k  
h - , where h and   4.3 eV are the photon energy and work function respectively, the reduction of photon energy from h  25 eV to 6.2 eV leads to at least three times improvement in k, with an ultimate experimental resolution of k = 0.001 A° -1. The greatly improved energy, momentum resolution together with the high data acquisition efficiency is critical for the successful observation of the electron-phonon coupling induced kink in the TrARPES data and the phonon threshold effect.
