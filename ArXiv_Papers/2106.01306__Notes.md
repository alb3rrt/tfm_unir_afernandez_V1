## Abstract

The dynamics of a multiplex heterogeneous network of oscillators is studied. Two types of similar models based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism are used as the basic elements of the networks. The first type model demonstrates bursting oscillations. The second model demonstrates bistability between bursting attractor and stable steady state. Basin of attraction of the stable equilibrium in the model is very small. Bistabilty is a result taking into account an additional ion channel, which has a non-monotonic characteristic and can be interpreted as a channel with a communication defect. Suggested multiplex networks assumed more active communication between models with a defect as a result in such networks it is enough to have one element with a communication defect in the subnetworks in order to stabilize the state of equilibrium in the entire network.
