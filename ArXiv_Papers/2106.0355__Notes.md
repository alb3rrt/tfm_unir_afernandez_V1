## Abstract

The paper presents a distinctive and straightforward technique for stabilization of multi-variable systems. The idea is to decouple the system state matrix depending on different inputs and outputs. Refined special canonical transformations are described for the design of controller and observer for a single-input and single-output (SISO) case and are extended to multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. These transformations help in the stabilization of the error dynamics of the observer and in placing the closed loop poles of the system. The idea is not only in the transformations taken but also how the gain matrices are selected which simplifies the computation.
