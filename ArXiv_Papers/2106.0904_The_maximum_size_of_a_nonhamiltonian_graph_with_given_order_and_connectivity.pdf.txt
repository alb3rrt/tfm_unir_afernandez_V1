Abstract
Motivated by work of Erdos, Ota determined the maximum size g(n, k) of a k-connected nonhamiltonian graph of order n in 1995. But for some pairs n, k, the maximum size is not attained by a graph of connectivity k. For example, g(15, 3) = 77 is attained by a unique graph of connectivity 7, not 3. In this paper we obtain more precise information by determining the maximum size of a nonhamiltonian graph of order n and connectivity k, and determining the extremal graphs. Consequently we solve the corresponding problem for nontraceable graphs.

1 Introduction
We consider finite simple graphs, and use standard terminology and notations. The order of a graph is its number of vertices, and the size its number of edges. For graphs we will use equality up to isomorphism, so G1 = G2 means that G1 and G2 are isomorphic. G denotes the complement of a graph G. For two graphs G and H, G  H denotes the join of G and H, which is obtained from the disjoint union G + H by adding edges joining every vertex of G to every vertex of H. Kn denotes the complete graph of order n.

One way to understand hamiltonian graphs is to investigate nonhamiltonian graphs. In 1961 Ore [8] determined the maximum size of a nonhamiltonian graph with a given order and also determined the extremal graphs.

Lemma 1. (Ore [8]) The maximum size of a nonhamiltonian graph of order n is

n-1 2

+ 1 and this size is attained by a graph G if and only if G = K1  (Kn-2 + K1) or

G = K2  K3.

Bondy [1] gave a new proof of Lemma 1. It is natural to ask the same question by putting constraints on the graphs. In 1962 Erdos [6] determined the maximum size of a nonhamiltonian graph of order n and minimum degree at least k, while in 1995 Ota [9] determined the maximum size g(n, k) of a k-connected nonhamiltonian graph of order n. But for some pairs n, k, the maximum size is not attained by a graph of connectivity k. For example, g(15, 3) = 77 is attained by a unique graph of connectivity 7, not 3.

In this paper we obtain more precise information by determining the maximum size of a nonhamiltonian graph of order n and connectivity k, and determining the extremal graphs, from which Ota's result can be deduced. Consequently we solve the corresponding problem for nontraceable graphs.

2 Main results
Denote by V (G) and E(G) the vertex set and edge set of a graph G respectively. For S  V (G), we denote by G[S] the subgraph of G induced by S. deg(v) denotes the degree of a vertex v, and (G) denotes the minimum degree of a graph G. Let Ks, t denote the complete bipartite graph on s and t vertices.
We denote by (G) and (G) the connectivity and independence number of a graph G respectively.
We will need the following lemmas. Lemma 2. (Chva´tal [4]) Let G be a graph with degree sequence d1  d2  · · ·  dn where n  3. If there is no integer k with 1  k < n/2 such that dk  k and dn-k < n - k, then G is hamiltonian. Lemma 2 can also be found in [3, p.488]. Lemma 3. (Chva´tal-Erdos [5]) Let G be a graph of order at least three. If (G)

(G), then G is hamiltonian. Lemma 3 can also be found in [3, p.488] and [10, p.292]. Given a graph G and a positive integer s with s  (G), denote

s(G) = min

deg(v) T  V (G) is an independent set and |T | = s .

The following result is a special case of Ota's theorem.

Lemma 4. (Ota [9, Theorem 1]) Let G be a k-connected graph of order n where 2  k < (G). If for every integer p with k  p  (G) - 1 we have p+1(G)  n + p2 - p, then G is hamiltonian.

A bipartite graph with partite sets X and Y is called balanced if |X| = |Y |. For n  3, we denote by Kn, n-2 +4e the bipartite graph obtained from Kn, n-2 by adding two vertices which are adjacent to two common vertices of degree n - 2.

Lemma 5. (Liu-Shiu-Xue [7]) Given an integer n  4, let (n) denote the set of all nonhamiltonian balanced bipartite graphs of order 2n with minimum degree at least 2, and let (3) denote the set of all nonhamiltonian balanced bipartite graphs of order 6. Then for any n  3, the maximum size of a graph in (n) is n2 - 2n + 4 and this maximum size is uniquely attained by the graph Kn, n-2 + 4e.
The case n  4 of Lemma 5 is proved in [7, p.257] and the case n = 3 can be verified easily. We will use this lemma with all n  3 cases.

Lemma 6. (Bondy [2]) Let G be a graph of order n with degree sequence d1  d2  · · ·  dn and let k be an integer with 0  k  n - 2. If for each integer j with 1  j  n - 1 - dn-k we have dj  j + k, then G is (k + 1)-connected.
Lemma 7. Let G = Ks  Kt or G = Ks  (K2 + Kt) where t  2 in both cases, and let F  E(G) with |F | = f  s. Then (G - F )  s - f, with equality if and only if all the edges in F are incident to one common vertex in Kt.
Proof. We prove the case when G = Ks  Kt. The case when G = Ks  (K2 + Kt) can be proved similarly.

It is easy to see that (G) = s. Since deleting one edge reduces the connectivity by at most one [10, p.169], we have (G - F )  s - f.

Next we use induction on f to prove the equality condition. First consider the case f = 1. Let e  E(G). It is easy to check that (G - e) = s - 1 if and only if e has one

3

endpoint in Ks and the other endpoint in Kt. Now let F  E(G) with |F | = f  2 and suppose that for any A  E(G) with |A| = f - 1, (G - A) = s - (f - 1) if and only if all the edges in A are incident to one common vertex in Kt.
If all edges in F are incident to one common vertex in Kt, it is easy to verify that (G - F ) = s - f. Conversely, suppose (G - F ) = s - f. Let F = {e1, e2, . . . , ef } and denote F  = F \ {ef }. Then (G - F ) = s - f + 1. By the induction hypothesis, the edges e1, . . . , ef-1 are incident to one common vertex w in Kt. The degree sequence of G - F  is

s - f + 1, s, . . . , s, n - 2, . . . , n - 2, n - 1, . . . , n - 1

t-1

f -1

s-f +1

where n = s+t and s-f +1 = deg(w). We assert that ef is incident to w and consequently

all the edges in F are incident to one common vertex in Kt. Let the degree sequence of

G - F be d1  · · ·  dn. By the above degree sequence of G - F  we deduce that

dn-s+f  n - 2. Thus n - 1 - dn-s+f  1. If ef is not incident to w, then we would have

d1 = s - f + 1 = 1 + (s - f ). By Lemma 6, G - F is (s - f + 1)-connected, contradicting

the assumption (G - F ) = s - f. This proves that ef is incident to w.



Notation 1. e(G) denotes the size of a graph G.

Notation 2. For positive integers n and k with n odd and n  2k + 1, G1(n, k) denotes the graph obtained from K(n-1)/2  K(n+1)/2 by deleting (n - 1)/2 - k edges that are incident to one common vertex in K(n+1)/2; for positive integers n and k with n even and n  2k + 2, G2(n, k) denotes the graph obtained from K(n-2)/2  (K2 + K(n-2)/2) by deleting (n - 2)/2 - k edges that are incident to one common vertex in K(n-2)/2.
Note that by Dirac's theorem [3, p.485], for the existence of a nonhamiltonian graph of order n and connectivity k we necessarily have n  2k + 1. Now we are ready to state and prove the main result.

Theorem 8. Let f (n, k) denote the maximum size of a nonhamiltonian graph of order n and connectivity k. Then

If n = 6k - 5, then f (n, k) is attained by a graph G if and only if G = Kk  (Kn-2k + Kk) or G = G1(n, k). If n = 6k - 8, then f (n, k) is attained by a graph G if and only if

4

G = Kk  (Kn-2k + Kk) or G = G2(n, k). If n is odd and n  6k - 3 or n is even and n  6k - 6, then f (n, k) is attained by a graph G if and only if G = Kk  (Kn-2k + Kk). If n is odd and 2k + 1  n  6k - 7, then f (n, k) is attained by a graph H if and only if H = G1(n, k). If n is even and 2k + 2  n  6k - 10, then f (n, k) is attained by a graph Z if and only if Z = G2(n, k).
Proof. The case k = 1 of Theorem 8 follows from Lemma 1. Note that the extremal graph K2  K3 of order 5 in Lemma 1 has connectivity 2 and hence it should be excluded.
Next suppose k  2. It is easy to verify that the extremal graphs stated in Theorem 8 are nonhamiltonian graphs of order n and connectivity k with size f (n, k). They are nonhamiltonian since any hamiltonian graph must be tough [3, pp.472-473]. Thus it remains to show that f (n, k) is an upper bound on the size and it can only be attained by these extremal graphs.

Let Q be a nonhamiltonian graph of order n and connectivity k with degree sequence

d1  d2  · · ·  dn. By Lemma 3, k < (Q) and by Lemma 4, there exists an integer p

with k  p  (Q) - 1 such that p+1(Q)  n + p2 - p - 1. Let S be an independent set

of Q with cardinality p + 1 whose degree sum is p+1(Q). Then e(Q[V (Q) \ S]) 

n-p-1 2

.

We distinguish four cases.

Case 1. n is odd and n  6k - 5.

Subcase 1.1. p  (n - 3)/2.

The conditions p  (n - 3)/2 and n  6k - 5 imply 3p + 3k + 1 < 2n. This, together with the condition p  k, yields (p - k)(3p + 3k + 1 - 2n)  0. It follows that

e(Q)  n + p2 - p - 1 +

n-p-1 2



n-k 2

+ k2

(1)

and equality holds in the second inequality in (1) if and only if p = k.

Now suppose that Q has size

n-k 2

+ k2. Then p = k, S has cardinality k + 1 and

degree sum n + k2 - k - 1, and V (Q) \ S is a clique. Since k + 1 < (n + 1)/2, we have

d(n+1)/2  n - k - 2. By Lemma 2, there exists i with i < n/2 such that di  i and dn-i  n - i - 1. Since n is odd, the condition i < n/2 means i  (n - 1)/2. We have

e(Q) =

n-k 2

+ k2  [i2 + (n - 2i)(n - i - 1) + i(n - 1)]/2,

(2)

where the inequality is equivalent to (i-k)(2n-3i-3k -1)  0. Since i  di  (Q)  k, we obtain i = k or n  (3i + 3k + 1)/2.

5

If i = k, equality holds in (2) and hence the degree sequence of Q is

k, . . . , k, n - k - 1, . . . , n - k - 1, n - 1, . . . , n - 1,

k

n-2k

k

implying that Q = Kk  (Kn-2k + Kk).
Now suppose i = k. Then we have n  (3i + 3k + 1)/2. If i  (n - 3)/2, then n  6k - 7, contradicting our assumption n  6k - 5. Thus i = (n - 1)/2. We have n - k - 2  d(n+1)/2  (n - 1)/2. Hence 6k - 5  n  2k + 3, which, together with the condition k  2, yields k = 2 and n = 7. It is easy to check that there are exactly four graphs of order 7 and size 14 with d4 = 3, among which G1(7, 2) is the only graph that is nonhamiltonian with connectivity 2. Hence Q = G1(7, 2).
Subcase 1.2. p  (n - 1)/2.

Clearly Q is a spanning subgraph of R = Kn-p-1  Kp+1. If p  (n + 1)/2, then

e(Q) 

n-p-1 2

+ (n - p - 1)(p + 1) <

n-k 2

+ k2

where the second inequality follows from the condition n  6k - 5. If p = (n - 1)/2, we have (R) = n - p - 1 > k. Let F  E(R) such that Q = R - F. Since (Q) = k, by Lemma 7 we have |F |  n - p - 1 - k. Thus

e(Q) 

n-p-1 2

+ (n - p - 1)(p + 1) - (n - p - 1 - k) 

n-k 2

+ k2

(3)

and equality holds in the second inequality of (3) if and only if n = 6k - 5.

Suppose e(Q) =

n-k 2

+ k2. Then n = 6k - 5 and |F | = n - p - 1 - k. By Lemma 7,

all the edges in F are incident to one common vertex in Kp+1. Since p = (n - 1)/2, we

have n - p - 1 = (n - 1)/2, p + 1 = (n + 1)/2 and |F | = (n - 1)/2 - k. It follows that

Q = G1(n, k).

Case 2. n is odd and 2k + 1  n  6k - 7.

Subcase 2.1. k  p < (n - 1)/2.

We have

e(Q)  n + p2 - p - 1 +

n-p-1 2

Subcase 2.2. p = (n - 1)/2.

In this case Q is a spanning subgraph of Kp  Kp+1. Since (Q) = k, by Lemma 7 we

In this case Q is a spanning subgraph of Kn-p-1  Kp+1. Then

where we have used the condition n  2p - 1.

Case 3. n is even and n  6k - 8.

Subcase 3.1. p < (n - 2)/2.

The assumptions imply 3p + 3k + 1 - 2n < 0. We have

e(Q)  n + p2 - p - 1 +

n-p-1 2



n-k 2

+ k2

(4)

where the second inequality is equivalent to

(p - k)(3p + 3k + 1 - 2n)  0.

Thus equality holds in the second inequality in (4) if and only if p = k.

Suppose e(Q) =

n-k 2

+ k2. Then p = k and Q has a clique of cardinality n - p - 1

and an independent set of cardinality p + 1 whose degree sum equals n + p2 - p - 1. Also

d(n+2)/2  n-k-2. By Lemma 2, there exists i < n/2 such that di  i and dn-i  n-i-1. We have

e(Q) =

n-k 2

+ k2  [i2 + (n - 2i)(n - i - 1) + i(n - 1)]/2,

where the inequality is equivalent to

(i - k)(2n - 3i - 3k - 1)  0.

(5)

Note that i  k since i  di  (Q)  k. If i = k, then the degree sequence of Q is

k, . . . , k, n - k - 1, . . . , n - k - 1, n - 1, . . . , n - 1,

k

n-2k

implying Q = Kk  (Kn-2k + Kk).
Next suppose i = k. Then the inequality (5) implies 2n-3i-3k-1  0. If i  (n-4)/2, we deduce that n  6k - 10, a contradiction. Hence i = (n - 2)/2. Now the conditions dn-i  n - i - 1 and d(n+2)/2  n - k - 2 yield n - k - 2  d(n+2)/2  n/2. Thus 6k - 8  n  2k + 4. It follows that k = 2 and 4  n  8 or k = 3 and 10  n  10. The possibility n = 4 contradicts k < n/2 and n = 6 contradicts i = k. Only the two pairs (k, n) = (2, 8), (3, 10) can occur.

If k = 2 and n = 8, by the conditions n = 8, e = 19, d5 = 4 and being nonhamiltonian we deduce that Q = K3  (K2 + K3); if k = 3 and n = 10, the conditions n = 10, e(Q) = 30, k = 3, d6 = 5 and being nonhamiltonian force Q = G2(10, 3).
Subcase 3.2. p = (n - 2)/2.

Clearly (Q)  p + 1. We further distinguish two cases.

If (Q)  p + 2, then Q is a spanning subgraph of Kp  Kp+2. By Lemma 7 we have

e(Q) 

p 2

+ p(p + 2) - (p - k) <

n-k 2

+ k2.

(6)

The second inequality in (6) is equivalent to p2 + (5 - 4k)p + 3k2 - 5k + 2 > 0 which is guaranteed by p = (n - 2)/2  3k - 5.

If (Q) = p + 1, then Q is a spanning subgraph of Kp+1  Kp+1. Let Q denote the graph obtained from Q by deleting all the edges in Kp+1. Then Q is a nonhamiltonian balanced bipartite graph. There are two cases.

(a) Suppose n  8 and (Q)  2 or n = 6. By Lemma 5, e(Q)  (p+1)2-2(p+1)+4 =

p2 + 3. Hence

e(Q) 

p+1 2

+ p2 + 3 

n-k 2

+ k2.

(7)

The second inequality in (7) is equivalent to

p2 + (5 - 4k)p + 3k2 - 3k - 4  0

(8)

which is implied by the condition p  3k - 5. Equality holds in (8) if and only if k = 2

and p = 2, i.e., Q is the extremal graph of order 6 defined in Lemma 5. Hence Q has size

n-k 2

+ k2 if and only if Q = K2  (K2 + K2).

(b) Now suppose n  8 and (Q)  1. Let x  V (Q) with degQ(x) = (Q). Starting with the structure Kp+1  Kp+1, we deduce that x lies in Kp+1, since (Q)  2. In this

8

case Q is a spanning subgraph of Kp  (K2 + Kp). By Lemma 7 and using the fact that p  3k - 5 we have

e(Q) 

p+2 2

+ p2 - (p - k) 

n-k 2

+ k2.

(9)

Equality in the second inequality in (9) holds if and only if p = 3k-5; i.e, n = 6k-8. Thus

by (9) and Lemma 7, Q has size

n-k 2

+ k2 if and only if Q = G2(n, k) with n = 6k - 8.

Subcase 3.3. p > (n - 2)/2.

Q is a spanning subgraph of Kn-p-1  Kp+1. If p = n/2, we have n - p - 1  k. By Lemma 7

e(Q) 

n-p-1 2

+ (n - p - 1)(p + 1) - (n - p - 1 - k) <

n-k 2

+ k2.

(10)

The second inequality in (10) is equivalent to p2 + (3 - 4k)p + 3k2 - k - 2 > 0, which is implied by p = n/2  3k - 4.

If p  (n + 2)/2, we have

e(Q) 

n-p-1 2

+ (n - p - 1)(p + 1) <

n-k 2

+ k2.

(11)

The second inequality in (11) is equivalent to p2 + p + 3k2 + k - 2nk > 0. To prove this inequality it suffices to show p2 + (1 - 4k)p + 3k2 + 5k > 0, which is implied by p  (n + 2)/2  3k - 3.

Case 4. n is even and 2k + 2  n  6k - 10.

Denote m = (n - 2)/2. Then 3  k  m. We distinguish three subcases.

Subcase 4.1. p < m.

(12)

The second inequality in (12) is equivalent to 3p2 - (4m + 3)p + m2 + 5m - 2k < 0, which is implied by the conditions k  p < m  3k - 6.

Subcase 4.2. p = m.

If (Q)  p + 2, then Q is a spanning subgraph of Kp  Kp+2. Recall that p  k. By

9

Lemma 7 we have

e(Q) 

p 2

Now suppose (Q) = p + 1. Then Q is a spanning subgraph of Kp+1  Kp+1. Define the graph Q as in Subcase 3.2 above.

If (Q)  2, by Lemma 5 we have e(Q)  p2 + 3. Hence

e(Q)  p + 1 + p2 + 3 < 3n2 - 10n + 16 + k.

Q is a spanning subgraph of Kn-p-1  Kp+1. We further distinguish two cases.
(a) p = m + 1. Now the conditions 2k + 2  n and p = m + 1 = n/2 imply n - p - 1 = (n - 2)/2  k. By Lemma 7, we have

(b) p  m + 2. In this case the following rough estimate suffices:

(13)

The second inequality in (13) is equivalent to 4p2 + 4p - n2 - 6n + 8k + 16 > 0, which

holds, since n  2p - 2. This completes the proof.



The following corollary follows from Theorem 8 immediately.

Corollary 9. Let f (n, k) be defined as in Theorem 8. If G is a graph of order n and connectivity k with size larger than f (n, k), then G is hamiltonian.

10

Next we use Theorem 8 to deduce Ota's result.

Corollary 10. (Ota [9, p.209]) The maximum size of a k-connected nonhamiltonian graph of order n is

max

(n + 2)/2 2

n-1 2 2

.

(14)

Proof. Denote the number in (14) by M. Let f (n, c) be defined as in Theorem 8. It is easy to verify that
max{f (n, c)| k  c < n/2} = M

and the result follows.



A graph is traceable if it contains a Hamilton path; otherwise it is nontraceable. Next we turn to nontraceable graphs.

The following trick is well-known (e.g. [4, p.166] or [5, p.112]).

Lemma 11. Let G be a graph and denote H = G  K1. Then G is traceable if and only if H is hamiltonian, and (G) = k if and only if (H) = k + 1.

Notation 3. For positive integers n and k with n odd and n  2k + 3, H1(n, k) denotes the graph obtained from K(n-3)/2  (K2 + K(n-1)/2) by deleting (n - 3)/2 - k edges that are incident to one common vertex in K(n-1)/2; for positive integers n and k with n even and n  2k + 2, H2(n, k) denotes the graph obtained from K(n-2)/2  K(n+2)/2 by deleting (n - 2)/2 - k edges that are incident to one common vertex in K(n+2)/2.
By Dirac's theorem [3, p.485] and Lemma 11, for the existence of a nontraceable graph of order n and connectivity k we must have n  2k + 2. The following corollary follows from Theorem 8 and Lemma 11 immediately.

Corollary 12. Let (n, k) denote the maximum size of a nontraceable graph of order n and connectivity k. Then

+ k(k + 1)

if n is odd and n  6k - 3 or n is even and n  6k,

(n,

k)

=



3n2-12n+17 8

k

if n is odd and 2k + 3  n  6k - 5, if n is even and 2k + 2  n  6k - 2.

If n = 6k-3, then (n, k) is attained by a graph G if and only if G = Kk(Kn-2k-1+Kk+1) or G = H1(n, k). If n = 6k, then (n, k) is attained by a graph G if and only if G =

Kk  (Kn-2k-1 + Kk+1) or G = H2(n, k). If n is odd and n  6k - 1 or n is even and n  6k +2, then (n, k) is attained by a graph G if and only if G = Kk (Kn-2k-1 +Kk+1). If n is odd and 2k + 3  n  6k - 5, then (n, k) is attained by a graph G if and only if G = H1(n, k). If n is even and 2k + 2  n  6k - 2, then (n, k) is attained by a graph G if and only if G = H2(n, k).
