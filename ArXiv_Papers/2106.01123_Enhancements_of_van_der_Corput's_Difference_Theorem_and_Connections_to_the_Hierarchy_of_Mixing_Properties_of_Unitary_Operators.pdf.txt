Author(s): Sohail Farhangi Title: Enhancements of van der Corput's Difference Theorem and Connections to the Hierarchy of Mixing Properties of Unitary Operators Number of pages: Email of corresponding author: sohail.farhangi@gmail.com Abstract: We introduce some new variants of van der Corput's Difference Theorem in Hilbert spaces and juxtapose them with variants from the previous literature. We show that three of the variants from the previous literature correspond to weak mixing, strong mixing, and orthogonal bases in a Hilbert space (in a sense that will be made precise), and we introduce new variants corresponding to ergodicity and mild mixing. We correspondingly obtain 4 new variants of van der Corput's Difference Theorem in the context of uniform distribution and we discuss their mixing properties. We obtain some applications, including a new characterization of sequences (xn) n=1  [0, 1] for which (xn, xn+h) n=1 is uniformly distributed in [0, 1]2 for every h  N.

1 Introduction
In [10] J. G. van der Corput proved what is now known as van der Corput's Difference Theorem, which is an essential tool for constructing examples of uniformly distributed sequences.

Theorem 1.1 (van der Corput's Difference Theorem). If (xn) n=1  T is a sequence for which (xn+h - xn) n=1 is uniformly distributed for every h  N, then (xn) n=1 is uniformly distributed.
In Ergodic Theory, the following Hilbertian reformulation of Theorem 1.1 is of great use.

Theorem 1.2. Let H be a Hilbert space and (xn) n=1  H a bounded sequence of vectors. If

xn+h, xn = 0,

n=1

for every h  N, then

1N

lim || N N

xn|| = 0.

n=1

See [2], [9], and [12] for some uses of Theorem 1.2 in Ergodic Theory. We
will now view van der Corput's Difference Theorem from a Hilbertian point of
view that is different from Theorem 1.2. First, we need to introduce the Hilbert
space H that we will be working with. Let H be a Hilbert space, let (fn) n=1, (gn) n=1  H be sequences of vectors
satisfying

1 lim N N

N

||fn||2

and

1 lim N N

N

||gn||2 < .

n=1

Let (Nq) q=1 be an increasing sequence of positive integers for which

(1.1)

1 Nq

lim q Nq

n=1

xn+h, yn

H

exists whenever (xn) n=1, (yn) n=1  {(fn) n=1, (gn) n=1} and h  N. We can now construct a new Hilbert space H ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) from (fn) n=1, (gn) n=1 and (Nq) q=1 as follows. For any (xn) n=1, (yn) n=1  {(fn) n=1, (gn) n=1} and h  N, we define

(xn+h) n=1, (yn) n=1

H

1 Nq = lim
q Nq n=1

xn+h, yn

H.

We see that и, и H is a sesquilinear form on H = SpanC({(fn+h) n=1} h=1  {(gn+h) n=1} h=1). Letting S = {x  H | x, x H = 0}, we see that H /S is a pre-Hilbert space. We will soon see that H /S is complete and therefore a Hilbert space, so we define H ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) = H /S. We call H ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) the Hilbert space induced by ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1), and we may write H in place of H ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) if ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is understood from the context. We say that ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a permissible triple if H ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is well defined. We say that ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a weakly permissible triple if

1 Nq

lim
q

Nq

n=1

fn+h, gn

(1.2)

exists for every h  N. Given (xn) n=1  H for which (xn) n=1  H , we may view (xn) n=1 as an element of H by identifying (xn) n=1 with its equivalence class in H /S.
We will now verify that H /S is complete.

Theorem 1.3. If {(n,m) n=1} m=1  H = H ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a Cauchy sequence, then there exists (n) n=1  H for which

 lim  lim

(1.3)

In particular, H ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is complete.

Proof. We proceed by modifying the proof of the main result in section Д2 of chapter II of [5]. Let ( m) m=1 be a sequence of real numbers tending to 0 for which

(1.4)

whenever k  m. By induction, let T0 = N0 = 0 and let (Tm) m=1  N be such that conditions (i) - (iii) below hold.

Now let us define (n) n=1 by n = n,m where m is such that NTm-1 < n  NTm . To conclude the proof, we note that for m  1, k > m, and Tk-1 < T  Tk we have

Remark 1.4. Throughout this paper we will mostly be interested in bounded sequences (fn) n=1, (gn) n=1  H. However, even if ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a permissible triple for which (fn) n=1 and (gn) n=1 are bounded, there may still exist unbounded sequences {en} n=1  H for which {en} n=1  H . It is for this reason that we have to work with the more complicated assumption that

1 lim N N

||fn||2 < .

n=1

(1.13)

Remark 1.5. Let H be a Hilbert space. Let (fn) n=1, (gn) n=1  H and (Nq) q=1 be such that ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a permissible triple. The left shift S : H  H defined by S((xn) n=1) = (xn+1) n=1 for any (xn) n=1  H extends to an operator on H that we again denote by S. Since S((xn) n=1), S((yn) n=1) H = (xn) n=1, (yn) n=1 H for any (xn) n=1, (yn) n=1  H , we see that S is a unitary operator on H . This allows us to classify sequences in H that correspond to elements of (H , S) from different levels of the hierarchy of mixing.
Definition 1.6. Let H be a Hilbert space, U : H  H be a unitary operator, and f  H. f is a weakly mixing element of (H, U ) if for any g  H we have

lim

| U nf, g | = 0.

N N

n=1

(1.14)

f is a strongly mixing element of (H, U ) if for any g  H we have

lim U nf, g = 0.
N 

(1.15)

If H and U are understood from the context, then we may simply say that f is

a nearly weakly (strongly) mixing element.

Remark 1.8. We see that if (fn) n=1  H is a nearly weakly (strongly) mixing sequence if and only if for any permissible triple of the form((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1), (fn) n=1 is a nearly weakly (strongly) mixing element of (H ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1), S). Furthermore, we will see that if U : H  H is a unitary operator, then for any f  H, (U nf ) n=1 is a nearly weakly (strongly) mixing sequence if and only if U is a nearly weakly (strongly) mixing unitary operator.
Remark 1.9. nearly orthogonal sequences display mixing properties similar to that of an orthornomal set {en} n=1 in a Hilbert space H. We recall that for any x  H, we have


| x, en |2  M ||x||2,

(1.22)

n=1

where M is an upper bound of the sequence {||en||} n=1. We now see that if (fn) n=1  H is an nearly orthogonal sequence, then for any permissible triple of the form ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) and H = H ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1), we have


Sh((fn) n=1), (gn) n=1 H  M ||(gn) n=1||2H .
h=1

(1.23)

It follows that (fn) n=1 exhibits mixing properties similar to that of an orthonormal set of vectors, however, it should be noted that there exist sets of

vectors that are not orthonormal, but are still nearly orthogonal. For exam-

ple, if {en} n=1  H is a bounded orthonormal set as before, then the sequence

(fn) n=1

given

by

fn

(en

+

en+1)

satisfies

equation

1.23

with

M

=

2,

but

is

not an orthogonal set.

We are now ready to state and prove some of the main results of this paper.

Theorem 1.10. Let H be a Hilbert space and let (fn) n=1  H be a bounded sequence. (fn) n=1 is a completely ergodic sequence if and only if for any permissible triple of the form ((fn) n=1, (fn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) we have

(1.24)

Proof. If (fn) n=1 is a completely ergodic sequence, then the desired result follows immediately. Now let us show that (fn) n=1 is a completely ergodic sequence if equation (1.24) is satisfied. Let (gn) n=1  H and (Nq) q=1  N be such that ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a weakly permissible triple. By passing to a subsequence of (Nq) q=1 if necessary, we may assume without loss of generality ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a permissible triple, so may define H = H ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1). Let S : H  H denote the unitary operator induced by the left shift. Let H = I I , where I := {  H | S = } and I  = c ({ - S |   H }). Let (fn) n=1 = 1 + 2 with 1  I and 2  I . Noting that I and I  are invariant under S and that equation
(1.24) can be restated as

Theorem 1.13. Let H be a Hilbert space and let (fn) n=1  H be a bounded sequence. (fn) n=1 is a nearly weakly mixing sequence if and only if for any permissible triple of the form ((fn) n=1, (fn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) we have

Let (gn) n=1  H and (Nq) q=1  N be such that ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a weakly permissible triple. By passing to a subsequence of (Nq) q=1 if necessary, we may assume without loss of generality ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a permissible triple, so may define H = H ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1). Let S : H  H denote the unitary operator induced by the left shift. From equation (1.35) we see that

H

Let (gn) n=1  H and (Nq) q=1  N be such that ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a weakly permissible triple. By passing to a subsequence of (Nq) q=1 if necessary, we may assume without loss of generality ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a permissible triple, so may define H = H ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1). Let S : H  H denote the unitary operator induced by the left shift. From equation (1.39) we see that

(1.40)

so (fn+h) n=1 is a mildly mixing element of (H , U ) by Lemma 9.24 of [12]. It follows that

2Lemma 2.1 from section 2 will show us that this corollary is a generalization of Theorem 7.11 from [11], which is a well known variant of van der Corput's Difference Theorem.

Proof. If (fn) n=1 is a nearly strongly mixing sequence, then the desired result follows immediately. Now let us show that (fn) n=1 is a nearly strongly mixing sequence if equation (1.47) is satisfied. Let (gn) n=1  H and (Nq) q=1  N be such that ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a weakly permissible triple. By passing to a subsequence of (Nq) q=1 if necessary, we may assume without loss of generality ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a permissible triple, so may define H = H ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1). Let S : H  H denote the unitary operator induced by the left shift. From equation (1.50) we see that

lim
h

Sh((fn) n=1), (fn) n=1

H

(1.48)

so (fn) n=1 is a strongly mixing element of (H , S) by Lemma 1 of [15]. It follows that

then (fn) n=1 is an nearly strongly mixing sequence.

(1.50)

Corollary 1.21. Let U : H  H be a unitary operator and f  H. (U nf ) n=1 is a nearly strongly mixing sequence if and only if f is a strongly mixing element

Proof. We see that for any permissible triple of the form ((U nf ) n=1, (U nf ) n=1, (Nq) q=1) we have

Theorem 1.22. Let H be a Hilbert space and let (fn) n=1  H be a bounded sequence. (fn) n=1 is a nearly orthogonal sequence if and only if for any permissible triple of the form ((fn) n=1, (fn) n=1, (Nq) q=1), we have

exists for every h  N. By passing to a subsequence of (Nq) q=1 if necessary, we may assume without loss of generality ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a permissible triple, so may define H = H ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1). Let S : H  H denote the unitary operator induced by the left shift. From

equation (1.53) we see that

Sh((fn) n=1), (fn) n=1 H = 0

(1.60)

for every h  N, so {(fn+h) n=1} h=1 is a bounded orthogonal set of vectors in H , which yields the desired result.

for every h  N.3

(1.61)

Proof. It is clear that equation (1.61) implies equation (1.53) which proves the
forward direction of the corollary. We will now prove the reverse direction of the corollary. Let h  N and (Mq) q=1  N be such that

(1.62)

By passing to a subsequence (Nq) q=1 of (Mq) q=1 we may assume without loss of generality that ((fn) n=1, (fn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a permissible triple. Since (fn) n=1 is a nearly orthogonal sequence, we see by Theorem 1.22 that

Corollary 1.24. Let U : H  H be a unitary operator and f  H. (U nf ) n=1 is a nearly orthogonal sequence if and only if {U nf } n=1 is a set of orthogonal vectors.
Proof. We see that for any permissible triple of the form ((U nf ) n=1, (U nf ) n=1, (Nq) q=1) we have

We now see from Theorem 1.22 that (U nf ) n=1 is a nearly orthogonal sequence if and only if {U nf } n=1 is an orthogonal set of vectors.

3Lemma 2.1 from section 2 will show us that this corollary is a generalization of Theorem 1.2.

We also note that Theorems 1.13, 1.16, 1.19, and other variations of van
der Corput's Difference Theorem can all be proven simultaneously by using the
main results of [17] after H has been constructed. However, the main results of [17] cannot be used to prove Theorems 1.10 and 1.22. The following lemma shows us why we have had to work with subsequences (Nq) q=1 when taking limits instead of just using limit supremums.

Lemma 1.25. If {fn} n=1  H is any sequence for which

2 Properties of completely Ergodic, Nearly Weakly Mixing, Nearly Mildly Mixing, and Nearly Strongly Mixing Sequences
In this section we will demonstrate the difference between Theorems 1.2, 1.13, 1.19 and 1.23 by examining properties of weakly mixing, strongly mixing, and nearly orthogonal sequences. We will also require a few additional definitions before we can describe how the conclusion of Theorem 1.13 is stronger than that of Theorem 1.2 and how the conclusion of Theorem 1.19 is stronger than that of Theorem 1.13.
Lemma 2.1. Let H be a Hilbert space.
(1) Let (fn) n=1, (gn) n=1  H and let

(xn) n=1  SpanC ({(fn+h) n=1} h=1  {(gn+h) n=1} h=1) .

(2.1)

(i) If (fn) n=1 and (gn) n=1 are completely ergodic sequences, then (xn) n=1 is also a completely ergodic sequence.
(ii) If (fn) n=1 and (gn) n=1 are nearly weakly mixing sequences, then (xn) n=1 is also a nearly weakly mixing sequence.
(iii) If (fn) n=1 and (gn) n=1 are nearly mildly mixing sequences, then (xn) n=1 is also a nearly mildly mixing sequence.
(iv) If (fn) n=1 and (gn) n=1 are nearly strongly mixing sequences, then (xn) n=1 is also a nearly strongly mixing sequence.

(2) If (fn) n=1  H is a completely ergodic bounded seqeucne, then

1N

lim || N N

fn|| = 0.

n=1

(2.2)

(3) Let (fn) n=1  H and let {(gn,m) n=1} m=1 be a family of sequences in H for which

lim
m

1 lim N N

N
||fn - gn,m||2

n=1

= 0.

(2.3)

(i) If (gn,m) n=1 is a completely ergodic sequence for each m  N, then (fn) n=1 is also a completely ergodic sequence.

xv

(ii) If (gn,m) n=1 is a nearly weakly mixing sequence for each m  N, then (fn) n=1 is also a nearly weakly mixing sequence.
(iii) If (gn,m) n=1 is a nearly mildly mixing sequence for each m  N, then (fn) n=1 is also a nearly mildly mixing sequence.
(iv) If (gn,m) n=1 is a nearly strongly mixing sequence for each m  N, then (fn) n=1 is also a nearly strongly mixing sequence.

Proof. The proofs of all items of (1) and (3) are routine and therefore omitted. We will now prove (2). Let (fn) n=1  H be a completely ergodic that is uniformly bounded in norm by 1. Let > 0 be arbitrary. Let K  N be
such that

(i) f is an invariant element if U f = f .

Remark 2.4. We see that (fn) n=1  H is an invariant (compact, rigid) sequence if and only if for any permissible triple of the form ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1), (fn) n=1 is an invariant (compact, rigid) element of (H ((fn) n=1, (gn) n=1, (Nq) q=1), S). Furthermore, we see that if U : H  H is a unitary operator, then for any f  H, (U nf ) n=1 is an invariant (compact, rigid) sequence if and only if f is an invariant (compact, rigid) element of (H, U ).

Theorem 2.5. If (xn) n=1  H is a completely ergodic sequence if and only if for any invariant sequence (cn) n=1  H we have

Proof. For the first direction let us assume that (xn) n=1 is a completely ergodic sequence and (cn) n=1 is an invariant sequence. Let (Mq) q=1  N be such that

exists. Let (Nq) q=1 be any subsequence of (Mq) q=1 for which ((xn) n=1.(cn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a permissible triple, and let H = H ((xn) n=1.(cn) n=1, (Nq) q=1). Since (xn) n=1 is a completely ergodic sequence and (cn) n=1 is an invariant sequence, we see that

(2.22)

For the next direction, let us assume that (xn) n=1 satisfies equation (2.17) whenever (cn) n=1 is an invariant sequence. Let (Nq) q=1 be such that ((xn) n=1, (xn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a permissible triple and let H = H ((xn) n=1, (xn) n=1, (Nq) q=1). Let S : H  H denote the left shift unitary operator, and by the ergodic Theorem

we see that

(cn) n=1

:=

lim
H 

1 H

H

Sh(xn) n=1, (xn) n=1 H

h=1

(2.23)

is the projection of (xn) n=1 onto the subspace of elements of H that are invariant under S. If follows that

0 = (cn) n=1, (xn) n=1 H = (cn) n=1, (cn) n=1 H = ||(cn) n=1||2H . (2.24) Since (Nq) q=1 was arbitrary, the desired result follows from Theorem 1.10.

Lemma 2.6. Let H1, H2, and H3 be Hilbert spaces and let и : H1 О H2  H3 be a bilinear map for which ||f1 и f2||H3  C||f1||H1 ||f2||H2 for some C > 0 and any (f1, f2)  H1 О H2. If (fn,1) n=1  H1 and (fn,2) n=1  H2 are invariant sequences, then (fn,1 и fn,2) n=1 is also a invariant sequence.

Theorem 2.7. If (xn) n=1 is a completely ergodic sequence and (cn) n=1 is an invariant sequence, then (cnxn) n=1 is a completely ergodic sequence. In particular, we have that

1N

lim || N N

cnxn|| = 0.

n=1

(2.28)

Proof. (n) n=1  H be any invariant sequence. By Lemma 2.6 we see that (cnn) n=1 is an invariant sequence, so by Theorem 2.5 we see that

Since (n) n=1 was arbitrary, the desired result follows from Theorem 2.5.

Theorem 2.8 (Jacobs-de Leeuw-Glicksberg Decomposition). Given a Hilbert space H and a unitary operator U : H  H let

Hc := {  H |  is a compact element of H} and let

(2.30)

Hwm := {  H |  is a weakly mixing element of H}.

(2.31)

We have that H = Hc  Hwm.

Lemma 2.9. Let H1, H2, and H3 be Hilbert spaces and let и : H1 О H2  H3 be a bilinear map for which ||f1 и f2||H3  C||f1||H1 ||f2||H2 for some C > 0 and any (f1, f2)  H1 О H2. If (fn,1) n=1  H1 and (fn,2) n=1  H2 are compact sequences, then (fn,1 и fn,2) n=1 is also a compact sequence.
Proof. For i  {1, 2, 3} let Si : Hi  Hi denote the left shift unitary operator as in Remark 1.5. For i  {1, 2, 3} and (gn) n=1  Hi let

|||(gn) n=1|||2i

=

1 lim N N

N

||gn||2i .

n=1

(2.32)

We also note that a sequence (fn) n=1  Hi is compact if and only if {Sih(fn) n=1} h=1 is precompact in the topology of HiN induced by the seminorm ||| и |||i. When we give H1N О H2N the product topology, we see that

{(S1 О S2)h(fn,1, fn,2) n=1} h=1

(2.33)

 {(S1h1 О S2h2 )(fn,1, fn,2) n=1}(h1,h2)N2

(2.34)

= {S1h(fn,1) n=1} h=1 О {S2h(fn,2) n=1} h=1,

(2.35)

so {(S1 ОS2)h(fn,1, fn,2) n=1} h=1 is also precompact in the product topology. Recall that the product topology on H1N ОH2N is induced by the seminorm |||и|||4
given by

|||(fn,1) n=1, (fn,2) n=1|||4 = |||(fn,1) n=1|||1 + |||(fn,2) n=1|||2.

(2.36)

Since {S3h(fn,1 и fn,2) n=1} h=1 is the image of {(S1 О S2)h(fn,1, fn,2) n=1} h=1

under и, it suffices to show that for any (gn,1, gn,2) n=1  H1N О H2N we have

Theorem 2.10 (cf. Lemma 3.19 in [14]). (xn) n=1  H is a nearly weakly mixing sequence if and only if for any compact sequence (cn) n=1  H we have

1N

lim N N

xn, cn = 0.

n=1

(2.43)

Proof. First, let us show that if (xn) n=1 is a nearly weakly mixing sequence and (cn) n=1 is a compact sequence then equation (2.10) holds. Let (Mq) q=1  N be such that

1 Mq

lim

Mq

n=1

xn, cn

(2.44)

exists. Let (Nq) q=1 be any subsequence of (Mq) q=1 for which ((xn) n=1, (cn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a permissible triple and let H = H ((xn) n=1, (cn) n=1, (Nq) q=1). Since (xn) n=1 is a weakly mixing element of H and (cn) n=1 is a compact element of H , we see as a consequence of the Jacobs-de Leeuw-Glicksberg Decomposition that

0 = (xn) n=1, (cn) n=1 H

(2.46)

Since (Mq) q=1 was arbitrary, the desired result follows. Now let us show that if (xn) n=1  H satisfies equation (2.43) whenever (cn) n=1  H is a compact sequence, then (xn) n=1 is a nearly weakly mixing sequence. Let (Nq) q=1  N be such that ((xn) n=1, (xn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a permissible triple. Let H = H ((xn) n=1, (xn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) and let H = Hc  Hwm be the Jacobs-de Leeuw-Glicksberg Decomposition of H with respect to the shift map S. Let (xn,c) n=1  Hc and (xn,wm) n=1  Hwm be such that (xn) n=1 = (xn,c) n=1 + (xn,wm) n=1. We see that

0 = ((xn,c) n=1, (xn) n=1 H = ((xn,c) n=1, (xn,c) n=1 + (xn,wm) n=1 H (2.47)

= ((xn,c) n=1, (xn,c) n=1 H = ||(xn,c) n=1||2H . It follows that (xn) n=1 = (xn,wm) n=1.

(2.48)

Remark 2.11. If one proved an analogue of Theorem 3.22 from [14] for sequences
taking values in a Hilbert space H (instead of just complex valued sequences) then one could show that (xn) n=1  H is a nearly weakly mixing sequence if and only if for any compact sequence (cn) n=1  H we have

1N

lim N N

xn, cn = 0.

n=1

(2.49)

Corollary 2.12. If (xn) n=1  H is a nearly weakly mixing sequence and (cn) n=1  C is a compact sequence, then (cnxn) n=1 is a nearly weakly mixing sequence. In particular, we have that

1N

lim || N N

cnxn|| = 0.

n=1

(2.50)

Proof. We will verify that (cnxn) n=1 satisfies Theorem 2.10. Let (gn) n=1  H be any compact sequence. Since (cn) n=1 is a compact sequence, by lemma 2.9 we see that (cngn) n=1 is a compact sequence. Since (xn) n=1 is a nearly weakly mixing sequence, we see that

3 Applications to Uniform Distribution
In this section we will often be working with sequences of complex numbers. Recalling that C is a Hilbert space when equipped with the inner product z1, z2 = z1z2, we will freely use the definitions of sections 1 and 2 in this context. For example, a sequence of complex numbers (cn) n=1 is a nearly strongly
xxiii

mixing sequence if it satisfies item (4) of definition 1.7 and (cn) n=1 is a compact sequence if it satisfies definition 2.3. Furthermore, throughout this section we will use md to denote the d-dimensional Lebesgue measure.
Before Discussing new results let us recall the definition of uniform distribution in [0, 1]d as well as some of its characterizations.

Definition 3.1. (xn) n=1  [0, 1]d is a uniformly distributed sequence if

sup lim
BR N 

1 |{1  n  N
N

| xn  B}| - md(B)

= 0.

3.1 New Notions in the Theory of Uniform Distribution

Definition 3.3. Let (xn) n=1  [0, 1]d and let C = {f  C([0, 1]d | [0,1]d f dmd = 0}.

(1) (xn) n=1 is an e-sequence if for any f  C (f (xn)) n=1 is a completely ergodic sequence.

(2) (xn) n=1 is an wm-sequence if for any f  C (f (xn)) n=1 is a nearly weakly mixing sequence.

(3) (xn) n=1 is an mm-sequence if for any f  C (f (xn)) n=1 is a nearly mildly mixing sequence.

5If k = (k1, k2, и и и , kd) and xn = (xn,1, xn,2, и и и , xn,d), then

(4) (xn) n=1 is an sm-sequence if for any f  C (f (xn)) n=1 is a nearly strongly mixing sequence.
(5) (xn) n=1 is an o-sequence if for any f  C (f (xn)) n=1 is a nearly orthogonal sequence.

Statement (2) of Lemma 2.1 and statement (3) of Theorem 3.2 show us that every e-sequence is a uniformly distributed sequence. Furthermore, we see that every wm-sequence is an e-sequence, every mm-sequence is a wmsequence, every sm-sequence is a mm-sequence, and every o-sequence is a smsequence. In Lemma 2.4 (3.1) of [8], it is shown that if ([0, 1], B, m, T ) is a nearly weakly (strongly) mixing measure preserving system, then for х-a.e. x  [0, 1], (T nx) n=1 is a wm-sequence (sm-sequence). We will also see in this section how esequences, wm-sequences, mm-sequences, and sm-sequences arise from variants of van der Corput's Difference Theorem as well. The case of o-sequences will also be examined. Before doing so, we will show that e-sequences, wm-sequences and mm-sequences are uniformly distributed along many subsequences in order to further illustrate how they are stronger properties than uniform distribution.

d(A) is the natural lower density of A and d(A) is the natural upper density of A. If d(A) = d(A), then we let d(A) denote the common value which is the natural density of A.
Definition 3.5. Let B = (bj) j=1  N be a strictly increasing sequence satisfying d(B) > 0.

(1) B is a invariant sequence if

d(B (B - 1)) = 0.

(3.7)

(2) B is a compact sequence if for any > 0, there exists k  N for which

sup min d((B + m) (B + k)) < .

(3.8)

(3) B is a rigid sequence if for any > 0, there exists k  N for which

d((B + nk) B) < .

(3.9)

We see that (bj) j=1 is an invariant, compact, or rigid sequence if and only
if (1B(n)) n=1 is an invariant, compact, or rigid sequence (of complex numbers)
respectively. The condition that d(B) > 0 tells us that the sequence will not be identified with 0 when we pass from H to H .
3.2 A Distributional Ergodic van der Corput Difference Theorem
Before we can properly state the analog of Corollary 1.11 we need to recall some basic definitions and theorems regarding the uniform distribution of doubly indexed sequences.
Definition 3.6. {xn,m}(n,m)N2  T is uniformly distributed if for every open interval U  T, we have

1

lim
K 

sup
N,M K

N M |{(n, m)  [1, N ] О [1, M ] | xn,m  U }| - х(U )

(3.10)

1 lim sup

e2ikxn,m = 0.

K

(m,n)[1,M ]О[1,N ]

(3.11)

Theorem 3.8. If (xn) n=1  T is such that (xn+h - xn)(n,h)N2 is uniformly distributed, then (xn) n=1 is an e-sequence.
We see that Theorem 3.8 is an immediate corollary to Corollary 1.11 and Theorem 3.7. We will now construct in example 3.9 an e-sequence that is not totally uniformly distributed. We will see later on that any wm-sequence is totally uniformly distributed, so the sequence in example 3.9 is an example of an e-sequence that is not a wm-sequence.

we

see

that

We also see that

(yn) n=1 is not totally uniformly distributed by construction. Now let us show

that {yn+h - yn}(n,h)N2 is uniformly distributed. First, we note that

(3.12)

We see that for each h  N, the sequence {yn+h - yn} n=1 takes on exactly 2 values, so it is not uniformly distributed. Now let k  N and > 0 both be arbitrary. Since (yn) n=1 is uniformly distributed, let H0  N be such that

exercise for the reader to show by direct computation that (yn+h - yn)(n,h)N2

is not uniformly distributed.

3.3 Distributional Weak, Mild, and Strong Mixing van der Corput Difference Theorems
Theorem 3.11. If (xn) n=1  [0, 1] is a wm-sequence and (nk) k=1  N is a compact sequence, then (xnk ) k=1 is a uniformly distributed sequence.
Proof. Let m  N be arbitrary, and note that (e2imxn ) n=1 is a nearly weakly
mixing sequence. Letting B = (nk) k=1, we see that (1B(n)) n=1 is a compact
sequence, so by Theorem 2.10 we see that

Theorem 3.12. If (xn) n=1  [0, 1] is a mm-sequence and (nk) k=1  N is a rigid sequence, then (xnk ) k=1 is a uniformly distributed sequence.
Proof. Let m  N be arbitrary, and note that (e2imxn ) n=1 is a nearly mildly
mixing sequence. Letting B = (nk) k=1, we see that (1B(n)) n=1 is a rigid
sequence, so by Theorem 2.13 we see that

Remark 3.13. One can actually show that (xn) n=1 is a wm-sequence (mmsequence) if and only if (xnk ) k=1 is uniformly distributed for any compact (rigid) sequence (nk) k=1  N. However, the proof of this is lengthy and involves the use of many ideas from [14], so we omit it.

Before proving our new variants of van der Corput's Difference Theorem for uniform distribution we recall the notion of discrepancy. The discrepancy of a sequence is a measure of how far away the sequence is from being uniformly distributed. We will be intuitively thinking about the discrepancy of a sequence as the norm of a vector in a Hilbert space.
Definition 3.14. Given a sequence (xn)Nn=1  [0, 1]d, the discrepancy of (xn) n=1  [0, 1]d is denoted by DN ((xn)Nn=1) and given by

DN ((xn)Nn=1) := sup
BR

1 |{1  n  N
N

| xn  B}| - md(B)

,

(3.24)

where R denotes the collection of all rectangular prisms contained in [0, 1]d. For an infinite sequence (xn) n=1  [0, 1]d, we let

and we let

(3.30)

d({n  N | |xn - L| < }) = 1.

(3.31)

Theorem 3.19. For (xn) n=1  [0, 1]d1 the following are equivalent: (1) (xn) n=1 is a wm-sequence. (2) For any uniformly distributed (yn) n=1  [0, 1]d2 and (Nq) q=1  N for which ({(xn, yn+h) n=1} h=1, (Nq) q=1) is a permissible pair, we have

1 lim H H

H

D((xn, xn+h) n=1, (Nq) q=1) = 0.

h=1

D((xn+h - xn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) = 0.

h=1

(3.34)

Proof. We will first show that (1) implies (2). Let (yn) n=1  [0, 1]d2 and (Nq) q=1  N be as in (2). We will show that equation (3.32) holds by using Lemma 3.18. Let > 0 be arbitrary, and let R  N be such that

( 3 )d( 2 ) < . 2 R+1 2

(3.35)

Let A = {r  Zd1+d2 | 0 < ||r||  R & ri = 0  1  i  d1.} and B = {r  Zd1+d2 | 0 < ||r||  R} \ A. Since (yn) n=1 is uniformly distributed,
we note that for any r  A, we have

(3.36)

For each r  B, we note that (e2i (r1,r2,иии ,rd),xn ) n=1 is a nearly weakly mixing sequence. By Lemma 3.18, let

Sr = {h  N | lim

(3.37)

, where (Nq) q=1 is any subsequence of (Nq) q=1 for which all of the limits defining Sr exist. Since d(Sr) = 1 for every r  B, we see that for S := rBSr

we also have d(S) = 1. Furthermore, for every h  S and r  B we have

which concludes the proof that (1) implies (2). It is clear that (2) implies (3), so let us show that (3) implies (4). Let T : [0, 1]2d1  [0, 1]d1 be the map
defined by

T (x1, x2, и и и , xd1 , xd1+1, и и и , x2d1 ) = (xd1+1 - x1, xd1+2 - x2, и и и , x2d1 - xd1 ). (3.42)
If B  [0, 1]d1 is an open rectangle, then T -1B is an open convex set in [0, 1]2d. It follows from Theorem 3.15 that for any open rectangle B, we have

D((xn+h - xn) n=1, (Nq) q=1)  J ((xn, xn+h), (Nq) q=1)

so the desired result follows from Lemma 3.18.

Since > 0 was arbitrary, Theorem 1.13 shows us that {e2ikxn } n=1 is a nearly weakly mixing sequence. Since k  N was also arbitrary, the desired
result follows from Lemma 2.1.

Now let us compare the results of this subsection to another similar result from the literature.

Definition 3.25. A sequence of natural numbers B = (nk) k=1 is a Besicovitch Almost Periodic Sequence if for any > 0, there exists 1, и и и , k  [0, 1]
and c1, и и и , ck  C for which

(3.58)

Theorem 3.26 (cf. Theorem 4.4 in [4]). If (xn) n=1  [0, 1] is a sequence for which (xn+h - xn) n=1 is uniformly distributed for every h  N, then for any Besicovitch sequence (nk) k=1, (xnk ) k=1 is uniformly distributed.
Theorem 3.26 can also be deduced from section 4 of [7]. Noting that any Besicovitch Almost Periodic Sequence of complex numbers is a compact sequence, and that any compact sequence of complex number is a rigid sequence, Theorems 3.11 and 3.12 shows us that Corollaries 3.20, 3.22, and 3.24 are each generalizations of Theorem 3.26. However, the astute reader may have noticed that we have yet to mention nearly orthogonal sequences in this section despite the apparent connection between the hypotheses of Theorem 3.26 and Corollary 1.23. The reason for this is that a sum of nearly orthogonal sequences is not necessarily of nearly orthogonal sequence, so we do not have an analogue of Lemma 2.1 for nearly orthogonal sequences. Nonetheless, we may prove some Theorems in this direction as well.

Theorem 3.27. (xn) n=1  [0, 1]d is an o-sequence if and only if for each h  N (xn, xn+h) n=1  [0, 1]2d is uniformly distributed.
Proof. For the first direction, let us assume that (xn, xn+h) n=1 is uniformly distributed in [0, 1]2d for any h  N. We see that for any k1, k2  Zd that are not both (0, 0, и и и , 0) and any h  N we have

lim

N
e2i( k1,xn + k2,xn+h ) = 0.

(3.59)

Now let f  C([0, 1]d) satisfy [0,1]d f dmd = 0 and let (ck)kZd be the Fourier coefficients of f . Let > 0 be arbitrary, and let K be such that

||f (x) -

cke2i k,x || < .

k[-K,K ]d

Noting that c(0,0,иии ,0) = 0, we see that for any h  N we have

(3.64)

Since > 0 was arbitrary, we are done with the first direciton. For the reverse direction, let us assume that (xn) n=1 is a o-sequence. We will first show that (xn+h - xn) n=1 is uniformly distributed for any h  N. To this end, let k  Zd \{(0, 0 и и и , 0)} and h  N both be arbitrary and note that (e2i k,xn ) n=1 is a nearly orthogonal sequence. Let (Nq) q=1 be any sequence for which

lim

1

Nq
e2i k,xn+h-xn

q Nq n=1

(3.65)

exists. By passing to a subsequence of (Nq) q=1 if necessary, we may assume without loss of generality that ((e2i k,xn ) n=1, (e2i k,xn ) n=1, (Nq) q=1) is a permissible triple. Since (e2i k,xn ) n=1 is a nearly orthogonal sequence it follows from Theorem 1.22 that

lim

1

Nq
e2i k,xn+h-xn = 0,

q Nq n=1

(3.66)

from which it follows that (xn+h - xn) n=1 is indeed uniformly distributed for any h  N. Now let h  N be arbitrary, let k1, k2  Zd be such that k1 and k2 are not both (0, 0, и и и , 0) and let (Nq) q=1  N be such that

lim

1

Nq
e2i( k1,xn + k2,xn+h )

q Nq n=1

(3.67)

exists. If k1 or k2 is (0, 0, и и и , 0), then the limit in equation 3.67 is 0 since (xn) n=1 is uniformly distributed so let us assume that neither of k1 and k2 are (0, 0, и и и , 0). Note that for any c  C (e2i k1,xn + ce2i k2,xn ) n=1 is a nearly
orthogonal sequence so we once again see from Theorem 1.22 that

We now see that (xn, xn+h) n=1 is uniformly distributed for any h  N.

We will now construct an example of a sequence (xn) n=1 such that (xn+h - xn) n=1 is uniformly distributed for every h  N but (xn) n=1 is not an o-sequence. Let   R \ Q be arbitrary and consider the sequence (xn) n=1 defined by xn = n2 (mod 1) if n is odd and xn = 2(n - 1)2 (mod 1) if n is even. To see that (xn) n=1 is not an o-sequence, it suffices by Theorem 3.27 to show that (xn, xn+1) n=1 is not uniformly distributed in [0, 1]2. To see that this is the case,
we note that

We will now show that (xn+h - xn) n=1 is a uniformly distributed sequence for every h  N. If h  N is even then let h = 2h and note that for any k  N
we have

e2 ik(xn+h -xn )

2N-1(n)e2ik(2h n+h 2)) = 0,

(3.78)

so (xn+h - xn) n=1 is uniformly distributed for every even h. If h  N is odd then let h = 2h + 1 and note that for any k  N we have

lim

N
e2 ik(xn+h -xn )

(3.81)

so (xn+h - xn) n=1 is uniformly distributed for all odd h as well. We also note that (xn, xn+h) n=1 is uniformly distributed in [0, 1]2 for all h  2, but we omit the proof of this fact since we do not need it.

Definition 3.28. For k  N, a function g : [0, )  R which is (k + 1)-times continuously differentiable is a tempered function of order k if the following hold.

(1) g(k+1)(x) tends monotonically to 0 as x tends to infinity.

(2)

lim xg(k+1)(x) = .

(3.82)

Theorem 3.29. If g : [0, )  R is a tempered function of order k that is (k + 2)-times continuously differentiable for some k  1, then (g(n)) n=1 is a o-sequence.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that g(k+1)(x) is positive and decreases to 0. Differentiating conditions (1) and (2) from definition 3.28 shows us that g(k+2)(x)  0 and g(k+1)(x) + xg(k+2)(x)  0 which also allows us to see that |xg(k+2)(x)|  g(k+1)(x) for x  1. Now let h  N be arbitrary so that we can show (g(n), g(n+h)) n=1 is uniformly distributed in [0, 1]2. First, let (a, b)  Z2 be such that a = -b. We will show that ag(x)+bg(x+h) is a tempered function of order n. By the intermediate value theorem, for each x  [0, ) there exists c = c(x)  (x, x + h) for which g(k+1)(x + h) - g(k+1)(x) = g(k+2)(c). We note that

(ag(x) + bg(x + h))(k+1) = ag(n+1)(x) + bg(k+1)(x + h) - = 0 and (3.83)
x

|x(ag(x) + bg(x + h))(k+1)| = |(a + b)xg(k+1)(x) + bx(g(k+1)(x + h) - g(k+1)(x))| (3.84)

= |(a + b)xg(k+1)(x) + bxg(k+2)(c)|  |(a + b)xg(k+1)(x)| - |b|g(k+1)(x) - = .
x
(3.85)
Since ag(x) + bg(x + h) is a tempered function of order k, we see that

lim

1

N
e2i(ag(n)+bg(n+h)) = 0.

N N

n=1

(3.86)

Next, let a  Z \ {0} be arbitrary, and note that ag(x + h) - ag(x) is a tempered function of order n - 1, so

lim

1

N
e2i(ag(n)-ag(n+h)) = 0.

N N

n=1

(3.87)

Since (g(n), g(n + h)) n=1 is uniformly distributed in [0, 1]2 for every h  N, we see that (g(n)) n=1 is an o-sequence by Theorem 3.27

xxxviii

Theorem 3.30. If p : R  R is a polynomial of degree 2 or more such that p(x) - p(0) has at least 1 irrational coefficient, then (p(n)) n=1 is an o-sequence.

The proof of Theorem 3.30 is a simple application of Theorem 3.27, so we leave it to the reader.

Definition 4.1 (cf. Definition 1.1 in [1]). A bounded sequence (fn) n=1  H is strongly mixing if and only if for any > 0 there exists K  N such that for any m  N the inequality fn, fm |  has at most K solutions n.
Theorem 4.2. Let (fn) n=1  H be a bounded sequence. If (fn) n=1 is a strongly mixing sequence then it is also a nearly strongly mixing sequence.

Proof. Let us assume for the sake of contradiction that (fn) n=1 is a strongly mixing sequence but not a nearly strongly mixing sequence. Without loss of generality, we may assume that (fn) n=1 satisfies ||fn||  1 for all n. Let (Nq) q=1  N be such that ((fn) n=1, (fn) n=1, (Nq) q=1) be a permissible triple. Since (fn) n=1 is not a nearly strongly mixing sequence, by Theorem 1.19 there exists > 0 and (hk) k=1  N for which

Luckily, it is much easier to construct an example of a sequence (fn) n=1  H that is nearly strongly mixing but not strongly mixing. To see that this is the
case, let H be any infinite dimensional Hilbert space and let (en) n=1 be an orthonormal basis of H. We see that (en) n=1 is certainly a strongly mixing sequence so it is also a nearly strongly mixing sequence. Let (fn) n=1 be defined by fn = e1 if n = 2m for some m  N and fn = en for all other n. We see that (fn) n=1 is not a strongly mixing sequence but still satisfies equation (1.47) and is therefore a nearly strongly mixing sequence by Theorem 1.19.

Definition 4.3 (cf. Definition 3.2 in [1]). A bounded sequence (fn) n=1  H is weakly mixing if and only if for any , > 0 there exists L  N such that for
every N  L and m  N the inequality | fn, fm |  has at most N solutions n with 1  n  N .

Theorem 4.4. Let (fn) n=1  H be a bounded sequence. If (fn) n=1 is a weakly mixing sequence then it is also a nearly weakly mixing sequence.

Since (fn) n=1 is not a nearly weakly mixing sequence, by Theorem 1.13 and Lemma 3.18 there exists > 0 and (hk) k=1  N with d((hk) k=1) > 0 for which

We will now construct an example of a nearly strongly mixing sequence that is not even a weakly mixing sequence. We first need to recall one more Theorem from [1].

Theorem 4.5 (cf. Theorem 3.1 in [1]). A bounded sequence (fn) n=1 is a weakly mixing if and only if for sequence A = (nk) k=1 with d(A) > 0 we have

1k

lim || k k

fnj || = 0.

j=1

(4.24)

For an example of a nearly strongly mixing sequence (fn) n=1 that is not even a weakly mixing sequence, note that for any   R \ Q, (e2in2) n=1 is a nearly strongly mixing sequence by Theorem 1.19. Furthermore, (n2 (mod 1)) n=1 is a sm-sequence by Theorem 3.24, so it is also uniformly distributed. It follows
that for

A

=

{n



N

|e2in2

we have d(A) > 0. Letting A = (nk) k=1, we see that

(4.26)

so (e2in2) n=1 is not a weakly mixing sequence by Theorem 4.5. It is interesting to note that nearly strongly mixing sequences exist in finite dimensional
Hilbert spaces, but weakly mixing sequences do not.

Definition 4.6 (cf. Definition 3.1 in [1]). A bounded sequence (fn) n=1  H is ergodic if and only if

1N

lim || N N

fn|| = 0.

n=1

(4.27)

xlii

As a result of item (ii) of lemma 2.1 we see any any completely ergodic

sequence is also an ergodic sequence. We will now explain how to construct

ergodic sequence that are not completely ergodic.

Let (fn) n=1  H be any ergodic sequence of vectors of norm 1 and let

(gn) n=1 be the sequence defined by gn = fm for

m 2

<n

m+1 2

.

Informally,

the sequence (gn) n=1 is the sequence f1, f2, f2, f3, f3, f3, f4, и и и . It is clear that

(gn) n=1 is an ergodic sequence since (fn) n=1 was an ergodic sequence. To see

that (gn) n=1 is not a completely ergodic sequence, we note that (gn) n=1 is a

nontrivial invariant sequence, so
