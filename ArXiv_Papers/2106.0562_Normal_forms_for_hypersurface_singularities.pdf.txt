NORMAL FORMS FOR HYPERSURFACE SINGULARITIES
P. FORTUNY AYUSO
Abstract. We provide normal forms for singularities of analytic hypersurfaces in (Cn, 0) using holomorphic vector fields.
1. Introduction and Notation
Let f : (Cn, 0)  (C, 0) be a holomorphic function defining the irreducible hypersurface Xf  (f = 0). When is any other germ of hypersurface Y in (Cn, 0) analytically isomorphic to Xf under a diffeomorphism of (Cn, 0)? The equivalent of this question for parametric curves (Zariski's moduli problem for plane curves) has been totally answered first by Hefez and Hernandes [4] using diffeomorphisms, and then by the author and J. Ribo´n in [3] by means of holomorphic vector fields and their associated exponentials (see also [2] for a simple proof, using just the Taylor expansion). However, the general question for plane curves in implicit form and even more, for hypersurfaces, remains unanswered (for reducible curves in parametric representation, Hernandes and Rodrigues have solved the problem in [5]). The aim of this short note is to provide a normal form for singular hypersurfaces, yielding, in the case of singularities with a specific type of coordinate system (as curves in the plane), a complete description of their moduli.
This note is de intento brief and does not contain examples. The author is preparing a longer manuscript in which, for instance, criteria for reducibility, and many examples will be included. The aim of this work is to make the results know in as straightforward a way as possible, without tiring the reader with inessential, possibly distracting, details.
2. Preliminaries
There are three important results from the field of differential equations which we shall liberally use hereafter (see [6, 7]). Denote by X(Cn, 0) the set of (germs of) holomorphic vector fields in (Cn, 0). Take X, Y  X(Cn, 0) and let X (s), Y (s) be their one-parameter groups in the variable s. Then:
(1) If the linear parts of X and Y are nilpotent (X and Y are called nilpotent for brevity), then the 1-parameter group Y  X (s) is the 1-parameter group of a holomorphic vector field in (Cn, 0).
(2) If  is a diffeomorphism of (Cn, 0) whose linear part is unipotent (has only 1 on its diagonal), then there is a holomorphic (i.e. convergent, not just formal) nilpotent vector field Z in (Cn, 0) such that  = Z(1).
(3) If  is a diffeomorphism of (Cn, 0), then  is the composition of a diagonal diffeomorphism and a unipotent one. As a consequence, as diagonal diffeomorphism are obviously exponentials of vector fields: any diffeomorphism of (Cn, 0) can be realized as the composition of a diagonal vector field and a nilpotent one.

Recall that Xf and Xg corresponding to (f = 0) and (g = 0) are analytically equivalent if there is an analytic diffeomorphism of (Cn, 0) sending one to the other. From the above statements follows:
Lemma 1. Two germs of hypersurfaces Xf and Xg are analytically equivalent if and only if, after a suitable linear change of coordinates, there is a (germ of ) nilpotent vector field in (Cn, 0) whose exponential at time 1 sends Xf to Xg.

3. Normal Form of Hypersurface Singularities

In order to state our main result, we shall construct a system of orderd variables in (Cn, 0). First of all, we use the Weierstrass polynomial iteratively, and then, if required, proceed by degrees. Our method goes as follows. Let X  f (x1, . . . , xn) = 0 be a germ of hypersurface in (Cn, 0).
(1) Take a generic system of variables (X1, . . . , Xn) such that f = 0 admits a Weierstrass expression:

n-1
X11 + Fi(X2, . . . , Xn)X1i = 0
i=0

where 1 = ord0 f (the multiplicity of f ). Fix X1 as the "largest" variable.

(2)

Perform the Tschirnhausen transformation X1

=

X1 -

1 1

Fn-1(X2,

.

.

.

,

Xn),

which is a unipotent linear map and corresponds to a nilpotent vector field.

(3) Consider the set X 0  X  X1 = 0. Repeat the above reasoning with

this set, which has multiplicity 2, in order to obtain another variable X2.

If 2 = 1, then we say that X1 and X2 are indistinguishable as of now.

Otherwise, we say that X1 is strictly the largest coordinate.

(4) Iterating the above process (1)­(3) for X 0 until an n-th variable is cho-

sen, we obtain a family of sets of variables V1 . . . , V such that i=1Vi = {X1, . . . , Xn}, and the variables in each Vi are pairwise indistinguishable

as of now. In any case, X  f (X1, . . . , Xn) = 0, where f is already in

Weierstrass form.

(5) If each Vi is a singleton, then we already have a total order of the variables

X1 > · · · > Xn, and we fix the order in the monomials in C[X1, . . . , Xn] as

the lexicographic one, and finish the process.

(6)

Otherwise, take X 1



(

f x1

= 0)  (X1

= 0), or, what amounts to the same,

X1



f (X1, . . . , Xn) - f (0, X2, . . . , Xn) X1

=

0

 (X1

=

0).

And repeat the process independently for each subset Vi which is not a singleton. Proceed like this (with X1 and repeating the steps (3)­(6)) until either there is a total order of variables or the n - 2-th derivative of f with respect to X1 has been computed.

In the end, we have a family V1, . . . , Vk of sets of variables such that in each Vi the elements are pairwise indistinguishable.

Definition 1 (Very good singularity). A very good singularity is one in which V1, . . . , V are all singletons. The system of coordinates obtained is called a very good system of coordinates.

If the singularity is not very good, we choose (there is no other option right now) an order of the variables in each set Vi, thus obtaining a total order. In the end, we have an order between the variables, which we rename to x1, . . . , xn so that x1 > x2 > . . . > xn, and the monomials in C[x1, . . . , xn] are order lexicographically

from now on. We call this set of ordered variables a reasonable system of coordinates for X (whether it is very good or not).
If some Vi had more than one element, then the variables in Vi are totally indistinguishable with respect to X from the linear point of view. This obviously does not guarantee that they must be analytically so. Notice that we have performed all the possible linear transformations telling one variable from another, so from now on, we deal just with nilpotent vector fields.

Definition 2. Let X  X(Cn, 0) be a nilpotent vector field. We say that X is minimal for f in the reasonable system (x1, . . . , xn) if, assuming df (X) = Qf + R is the Weierstrass division, then there is no X with df (X) = Qf + R and R = h(x1, . . . , xn)R with h(0, . . . , 0) = 0.

After these preliminaries, X has equation X  f (x1, . . . , xn) = 0 in Weierstrass form in the reasonable system (x1, . . . , xn) and we work only with nilpotent vector fields because we have done all we can with linear automorphisms. Let  be the multiplicity of f . With these assumptions,

Definition 3. Let X  X(Cn, 0) and consider the Weierstrass division

df (X) = Qf + R.

The function R is called the contact function of X with X .

The contact function is the error the vector field X incurs when one uses its associated one-parameter group to get automorphisms of (Cn, 0).

Theorem 1 (Monomial elimination). With the notations above, let X  X(Cn, 0) be a nilpotent polynomial vector field minimal for f and (x1, . . . , xn), and R its contact function. Let M = kx1a1 · · · xann be the minimum monomial of R. If K is a monomial with KM < X1, then KM can be removed from the equation of X without changing its analytic type.

Proof. Consider first K = 1. As X is polynomial, its exponential is convergent in the whole Cn × Cs, so there are no convergence issues. Take the differential
equation associated to X:

 

x 1

= X1(x1, . . . , xn)

  

x 2

= X2(x1, . . . , xn)

E

 

...



 

x n = Xn(x1, . . . , xn)

By definition, df (X) = Qf + R, and R = M + . . . where the dots are terms greater
than M in the lexicographic order. The Taylor expansion of the solutions of E for points (p1, . . . , pn)  (Cn, 0) (that is, the one-parameter group s) is :

 

x1(s) = p1 + sX1(p1, . . . , pn) + · · ·

  

x2(s) = p2 + sX2(p1, . . . , pn) + · · ·

s(p1, . . . , pn) = 

...



 

xn(s) = pn + sXn(p1, . . . , pn) + · · ·

if now we compute f (s(p1, . . . , pn)), we get f (s(p1, . . . , pn)) = f (p1, . . . , pn) + sdf (X)(p1, . . . , pn) + s2(· · · ) =

f (p1, . . . , pn) + sR(p1, . . . , pn) + · · ·

where the dots are greater than M (in the lexicographic order) because X is both nilpotent and minimal for f , in the coordinates (x1, . . . , xn). This gives the elimination of the monomial M just by choosing an adequate value of s.

P. FORTUNY AYUSO

For multiples KM not divisible by x1, we reason equally because the remainder of df (KX) divided by f is KR, by functional linearity of the differential.
Definition 4. Given a reasonable system for Xf , a minimal contact monomial is a monomial M such that there exists a minimal vector field X with df (X) = P f + R and M is the minimal monomial of R in the variables (x1, . . . , xn).
Corollary 2 (Normal form). Any hypersurface singularity has a normal form in which the minimal contact monomials with nilpotent vector fields are 0.
Proof. This follows from Monomial elimination and Artin's approximation theorem [1] (with the former we get a formal diffeomorphism, with the latter an analytic one).
Notice that if M can be eliminated, then any multiple xiM can also be eliminated, as df (gX) = gdf (X). This is why the definition of minimal field is important.
Remark 1 (Computation of a normal form). As (x1, . . . , xn) is reasonable, in order to compute a normal form, one can proceed as follows: compute all the minimal contact monomials and order them lexicographically, M1 < · · · < Mp. Remove the terms
Corollary 3 (Moduli of very good singularities). Assume X  f = 0 is a very good singularity and (x1, . . . , xn) is a very good system of coordinates. In this coordinates, the analytic moduli of X is parametrized, up to the action of a finite group, by the monomials which are not multiples of minimal contact monomials for nilpotent vector fields.
Proof. This is a direct consequence of the previous results. Notice that for a very good singularity, for each i, there is at least one monomial in which xi appears and the variables greater than xi do not. Choose the smallest one (in the lexicographic order) and make it have coefficient 1 in order to get the finite group action.
