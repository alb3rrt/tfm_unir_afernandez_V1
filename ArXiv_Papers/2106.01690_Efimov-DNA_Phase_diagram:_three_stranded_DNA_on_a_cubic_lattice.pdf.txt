I. INTRODUCTION

One of the strange results in quantum mechanics is the formation of an infinite number of bound states in a three-particle system when any two would have given a zero-energy bound state. This result goes by the name of Efimov effect1­6. It has recently been argued that the classical analogue of the Efimov effect is the formation of triple-stranded DNA at the melting point of duplex DNA7. In this paper we introduce a generalised three-stranded DNA model and examine its phase diagram using the flatPERM Monte Carlo method. Our model consists of a simple extension of the usual Gaussian-Chain model of DNA8. In the standard DNA model, the configurations of two identical random walk chains of given length, joined at a common origin, are considered where the only energy comes from base-pairings (common-visited sites) occurring at the same contour length from the common origin along both chains9.
In our model we label the two chains from the standard model as type B, and introduce a third chain, which we label type A. We denote the interaction strength by dimensionless variables (i.e. absorbing the factor kBT into the interaction strength, where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature) 1 for a base-pairing interaction between the type A chain and either of the type B chains, and 2 for base-pairing interaction between the two chains of type B. These are the only interactions included; there are no three-chain interactions other than those generated between the chains in pairs. The model is shown for strands of length of 14 on the square lattice in Fig 1.
Our purpose in this paper is to examine the full phase diagram for the model defined through the partition function

ZN (1, 2) = g3,N (n1, n2) exp(n11 + n22),

3,N

where we have denoted by 3,N the set of configurations of three random walks of length N . Here, g3,N (n1, n2) is the number of configurations with exactly n1 interactions between the type A chain with either of the type B chains (n1  [0, 2N ]) and exactly n2 interactions between the chains of type B. The attractive contact energies are taken as 1 and 2 for A-B and B-B pairs. Note that the temperature has been absorbed in the definition of these contact energies, so that 1,2 are dimensionless. In other words, the contact energies are given by kBT 1,2. We also examine the scaling of the free-energy at the three-stranded DNA

equivalent to the Efimov point. The Efimov point is located where the inter-chain interactions are the same, and at a
value where any two chains are at the two-chain binding transition.
II. CONNECTION BETWEEN DNA MODEL AND THE EFIMOV EFFECT
The formal connection between DNA melting and the quantum problem can be established as follows7. Take three gaussian polymers with native base-pairing interaction, i.e., two monomers on two chains interact if and only if they have the same contour length index

where ri(s) is the position coordinate of a monomer (or base) at contour length s. The first term represents the elastic energy or the connectivity of the chain as a polymer, while the second is the interaction between two monomers at the same contour length s (native base pairing of DNA). Like a Hydrogen bond, the range of interaction of V is taken to be small. The partition function is then given by

Z = DR exp(-H),

(3)

where the integral represents the sum over all configurations as a path integral. If we now do an imaginary transformation s = it, then the partition function changes to

G = DR exp(iS),

as if L represents the Lagrangian of three particles with pairwise interaction Vij = V (ri(t) - rj(t)), with t as real time. In this path-integral representation, G now describes the quantum propagator of three particles with short-range, pairwise interactions. The key point in this exact transformation is the native base pairing of DNA (monomers with the same index) that got translated into the same time interaction in the quantum picture. In the N   limit, the groundstate energy of the quantum problem maps onto the free energy of the DNA problem.
Double-stranded DNA undergoes a melting transition, as temperature is increased, or as the strength of the potential in Eq. (2) is changed. The melting point corresponds to the critical strength of the potential in the quantum problem above, in which a bound state occurs in a short-range potential in three dimensions. The bound state energy is related to the width a of the wave function, with E  2/2ma2, so that E  0 implies a  10.

At the critical value of zero energy bound state, Efimov argued that three particles will produce a long-range effective interaction -1/r2 which leads to a tower of bound states with

(5)

This is the Efimov effect.

The quantum fluctuations arise from the paths in the classically forbidden regions which

are outside the potential well. In the DNA picture, these are the regions on the chains where

the hydrogen bonds are broken by thermal fluctuations. A portion of the duplex with broken

hydrogen bonds will be called a bubble. The bubbles are characterized by two lengths,  ,

the fluctuation in the number of bonds broken, and  the corresponding length scale for the

spatial size, with the relation

  ,

(6)

where  is the polymer size exponent. For Gaussian polymers (random walks)  = 1/2. The melting transition of the DNA at temperature T = Tc, where the hydrogen bonds of
the duplex DNA are cooperatively broken, is described by the free energy per unit length

f  kBTc .

(7)



For a continuous transition, as one finds from exact solutions or from the Poland-Scheraga arguments, we may take f  (|T - Tc|/Tc)2- at least for T < Tc, so that   (|T - Tc|/Tc)-2. This transition, like many other critical points, shows continuous scale invariance in the sense that under a scale transformation r  br, the free energy scales as f  b-2f

for any b.

Let us now consider two strands of DNA -- let us call them A, B -- separated by a

distance R much larger than the hydrogen bond distance so that they do not form any

doublet. Now we add a third chain C that can pair with both A and B with the same bond

energy. If the temperature is close to the melting point of any pair, the large bubbles will

allow C to make contacts with both A and B, resulting in an attraction between the latter

two. This fluctuation induced interaction is given by an R-dependent free energy, modifying

Eq. (7) to

f  - kBTc F (R/),

(8)



5

where the scaling function F(x) should be such that Eq.(8) makes sense for  ,   . By

using Eq. (6), we then require F (x)  x-1/ so as to cancel  . At the critical point for C,

we then get

1

f (R)  - R2 ,

(9)

where the gaussian chain value  = 1/2 has been used. The above long-ranged inverse-square interaction is at the heart of the Efimov effect, but
it is obtained here via the DNA mapping. For DNA, this interaction would lead to a bound phase of three strands at the melting point of the duplex DNA. Consequently, the three chain complex will melt at a temperature higher than Tc.
There are two aspects of the Efimov effect. One is the formation of a three-particle bound state for potentials where two would not have formed a bound state. The second one, more subtle, is the formation of the Efimov tower precisely at the critical potential of zero energy bound-state for a pair, corresponding to the breaking of the continuous scale invariance of the critical point to a discrete scale invariance11,12.

III. PHASE DIAGRAM

In this section we present numerical results for the phase diagram, where we examine the different transition lines and phases. In order to determine the phase diagram, we have used the flatPERM method13 to stochastically enumerate (or partially enumerate) the coefficients of the relevant partition functions.
For the full model, we can define the partition function ZN through:

ZN (1, 2) = g3,N (n1, n2) exp(n11 + n22),
3,N

(10)

where we have denoted by 3,N the set of configurations of three random walks of length N . g3,N (n1, n2) is the number of configurations with exactly n1 interactions between the chain of type A with either of the type B chains (n1  [0, 2N ]) and exactly n2 interactions between the type B chains.
Having good estimates of g3,N (n1, n2) then allows densities and fluctuations in energy to be calculated directly. Suppose we have a quantity X(n1, n2), which we also calculate during

In particular, we can calculate the average number of contacts ni and the corresponding

fluctuations

The average number of contacts is expected to scale as8

where i = 0 in the unbound phase and i = 1 in the bound phase, and taking a potentially non-trivial value at the transition. This behaviour enables the setting up of a phenomenological renormalisation group method16 using the function

log(

) .

log(N/N )

(13)

Estimates for the critical values of 1 may be calculated looking for crossings of the i,N,N keeping 2 fixed (and the other way round). These crossings give estimates of i at the transition. Logically, one uses 1,N,N to calculate the critical values 1(2) (and vice-versa). The solid black line in the phase diagram in Fig 2 is calculated from 1,N,N/2 = 1,N/2,N/4 and the red dashed line using 2,N,N/2 = 2,N/2,N/4 with N = 200.
The phase diagram consists of three distinct phase transition lines that join at a multicritical point and separate out three phases: unbound, two-bound and three-bound, corresponding to the number of chains involved in the bound states.

A. Unbound/Two-Bound Phase boundary
When 1 = 0 the type A chain does not interact at all with the two type B chains, and the transition as 2 is decreased is the standard two chain DNA melting transition at 2 = (c2), where (c2) = 1.07726 · · · is the 2-chain binding transition8.
As 1 is increased, we can view the situation of the 2-chain complex adsorbing to the type A chain. Whilst the number of contacts is small (1 = 0), the chain type B will not affect the two-chain binding transition, and we would expect 2,c(1) = (c2) to remain constant until the third chain binds at the multicritical point. In Fig 2 the discrepancy between the estimated line (dashed) and expected transition is due to finite size effects. On the transition line we expect 1 = 0 and 2 = 1/2, which is consistent with the results found for chains up to N = 200.

B. Two-bound/Three-bound boundary
As 2  , the two type B chains become tightly bound and behave as one Gaussian chain. Each contact with the type A chain is a double contact, and we would thus expect a binding transition when 1 = (c2)/2. As 2 is lowered, whilst the two type B chains

remain bound, they will start containing bubbles. Now, when the type A chain comes into contact with the bound duplex, the number of contacts will sometimes be with one chain and sometimes with 2, making it harder to bind. This will have the effect of elevating the critical temperature, or making it harder to bind, such that 1,c(2) > (c2)/2. As the 2  (c2), the phase transition line merges with the 2-chain binding transition at the multi-critical point. Along this line we expect 1 = 1/2, as this is a standard type binding between two random walks (at least for large 2, and we see no evidence of a change in behaviour before the multi-critical point) and 2 = 1, since the two type B chains are bound. This is also borne out by the numerical results. In Figure 3 we show the plots of 1 and 2 as a function of 2 for two values of 1. When 1 = 0.4 (Fig. 3 (a)) we see that the density 1 remains zero, whilst 2 becomes non-zero as the phase boundary is crossed. When 1 = 0.6 (Fig. 3 (a)) 1 becomes non-zero later than 2, as we cross successively the unbound/two-bound phase boundary and the two-bound/three-bound phase boundary.
9

C. Unbound/Three-bound boundary
We first consider the case where 2 = 0. When 2 = 0, the two type B chains do not see each other, they only see the type A chain. At the critical interaction 1 = (c2) each type B chain binds with the chain of type A independently. This transition can be seen as two independent events. The chain of type A binds the other two into a triplex-bound state. This bound state ensures that the two chains of type B remain close to each other. The number of interactions n1 is the sum of the number of interactions with each of the chains of type B, and these contacts will be decorrelated between the two chains. It is clear then that n1  N 1/2, giving 1 = 1/2.
Estimates of 1 and 2 are shown in Figure 4, extrapolated by fitting to a quadratic function. It can be seen that 1 could reasonably extrapolate to 1/2, and 2 to a non-zero value, possibly 1/4, which is consistent with there being a bound triplet state, where the two type B chains are bound through the intermediary of type A chain.
We looked at the free energy for the triplet state at this point, and found it to be the same form as the free energy for the two-chain DNA model at its melting point (shown in Fig. 7) but twice as large.
This is interesting, since it is clear that when 1 = 2 the three chains are equivalent, and 1 = 2, which indicates that the point 1 = (c2), 2 = 0 is different in nature from the rest of the line. This is understandable, because the type B chains are already bound by the type A chain, and so a small change in  could reasonably make a big change. In Fig. 5 we look at the densities of the interactions 1 = n1/N and 2 = n2/N as a function of 1 for 2 = 0.6 and 2 = 1. In both cases we can see that the two densities become non-zero at the same time, indicating clearly that the phase above the transition is a triplet phase.
Fig 4 (b) shows 1 and 2 for 2 = 0.7. The two  seem as if they may reasonably give the same limiting value (around 0.68), which is bigger than 1/2. We compare to the plot with 1 = 2 (so 1 = 2 by construction). Here we seem to have a different limit, leading to the possibility (unverified) that 1,2 may vary along the unbound/3-bound phase boundary.
There is another possibility, which is that the line is weakly first order, which is the prediction of studies on hierarchical lattices7. It is difficult for the length of chains considered to tell the difference between a smooth variation of the density, or a small jump which might develop only for very long chains.

As 2 is increased, the type B chains will tend to bind more, which has the effect of making it easier for the type A chain to bind, which lowers the value of 1 required to maintain the triple-bound state. Along the whole of this phase transition line, the two type B chains are nevertheless held together by the action of the the type A chain. This stops when 2 = (c2), and the B-chains can bind in their own right. This occurs at the multi-critical point.

D. The multi-critical point
The multi-critical point location can be identified by looking at the crossings for i defined in Eq. 13 along the line 2 = (c2) = 1.07726 · · · . The value of 1 = 0 is expected along this line until the multicritical point, where it will be expected to take on a new value, indicating the adsorption of the type A chain to the type B chains. Likewise, the value 2 = 1/2 is expected along this line, but may or may not take on a new value at the multicritical point. In Fig. 6 we show plots of 1,2 against 1 showing crossings at the estimated location of the multicritical point. We show 1/2,N,N/2 for chains chains of lengths from N = 20 to N = 200 in steps of 20. In the same figure we show the variation of the estimate for the value of 1

IV. FINITE-SIZE SCALING

The distinctive feature of the Efimov effect is the occurrence of the Efimov constant that

determines the geometric scaling of the energy levels, viz.,  in Eq. (5). Although  is not

universal, it is still a characteristic number for the effect, and the value Efimov determined for fermions is  = (22.7)-2. The analogy with DNA seems to provide a different way of

having analogue behaviour, using a polymer-based Monte Carlo approach, in particular here we use the flatPERM method introduced by Prellberg and Krawczyk13.

For this purpose, we evaluated the free energy for three chains with the same interaction

To test the quality of the numerical data obtained from PERM, we check the nature at

=

(2) c

=

1.07726.

In fact, the simulations done at this point will not give critical point

data, as there is still a small shift T = 0 due to finite size effects.

Let us first derive the expected two-chain and three-chain scaling behaviour in order to

compare with our flatPERM data.

For a contact interaction, V (ri(t) - rj(t)) = v0(ri(t) - rj(t)), v0 < 0 in Eq. (2), standard dimensional analysis tells us [s] = [L]2, and [v0] = [L]d-2, where [L] denotes the dimension of length. For d > 2, the two chain melting is described by a Renormalization group fixed point u = 2, where  = 2 - d and u is the renormalized dimensionless coupling constant with the bare value u0 = v0L. In d = 3, the melting point is the unstable fixed point u = -2 ( = -1). At this fixed point, we associate the exponent for length  as

  |T |-,

1 = ,

where

T

the

the

point,

so

that

in

d=

  |T |-2.

(15)

Here  is the length in space while  is along the chain (number of bases).

The partition function is that of two or three interacting chains, free at one end but tied

together at the other. This configuration goes by the name of "survival" partition functions

of "vicious walkers". At the unstable fixed point, the behaviour of the finite length p-chain

partition function is of the form

ZN(p)  µN N -p ,

(16)

where the exponent p is given by14

p = p/2,

(17)





for p = 2, (exact)

p =

(18)

 3 + 3 ln(3/4) 2 + O(3) for p = 3,

We now use it for d = 3, i.e.,  = -1. At this fixed point, we find 2 = -1/2, for two chains at the melting point. For the critical contribution to the three-chain free energy, a direct sum gives 3 = -1.9315 which we approximate as -2.
Combining Eqs. (15) and (18), the scaling for a small T is (see also Ref8)

ZN(2)  (2d)2N N 1/2 G(T N 1/2),

(19)

14

For a small fixed T, G(x)  a + b x. Therefore, with µ = 2d (for a random walk on a d-dimensional cubic lattice), we have

without the Efimov effect. The Efimov tower (Eq. (5)) would lead to a different class of

terms of the type

Fefi  N |E0| + cje-Nkj ,

(22)

where kj's come from the energy gaps of the tower. The absolute sign for E0 is required because we are actually writing the expression for ln Z. Combining the two different contributions we have a form

FN(3) = f3N + |3| ln N + b3N 1/2 + a3 + cj exp(-N kj).

(23)

Note that, even though FN(2) has no O(N ) term, a linear term in FN(3) with f3 > 0 is a signature of the Efimov effect.
We use this RG based formula to fit numerically calculated free energy.

A fit to F3, given by Eq. 24, with reduced 2 = 0.053 gave f3 = 0.26182, b3 = -0.14524, a3 = -7.9429 with errors in the last digit, as estimated by the fitting program of GNUPLOT. Fitting to F3 + F (Eqs. 24, 25) gives a fit with the parameters reported in Table I. The two fits are shown in Fig. 8. To see the difference in fit, we need to look at short chain lengths, and the exponential terms are required to ensure a good fit with a   0.107.

by Ei = ik does not fit the Efimov tower prediction, where we would have expected Ei = (1 - i)f3, so whilst we confirm that we have multiple bound states in the threebound phase, where any two chains would not be bound, we do not confirm the Efimov tower. This could be either an indication that the behaviour is different, or rather the finite walk aspect of our investigation does not allow us to see all the possible bound states.
VI. DISCUSSION
In this article we presented results for the DNA analogue of Efimov-type scaling consisting of three-stranded DNA modelled by three random walkers starting from a common origin, and interacting only when two walks meet an equal number of steps from the origin, and the generalised model is studied for its phase diagram in 1 and 2.
At the equivalent point to the Efimov point (1 = 2 = 1.07726) we find three bound states, and excellent fitting to the free energy from length 0 to 10000, but these states don't follow the Efimov tower structure expected. Whilst the different energy states give the finite-size scaling behaviour of our system, it is not guaranteed that all will contribute. In the quantum system, we are looking at the eigenvalues of the time evolution operator, which in our case would correspond to a transfer matrix which adds a step to each of the DNA molecules. This can be seen as three interacting partially directed walks in 3+1 dimensions. In a future work we will look at this transfer matrix to see if it is possible to extract the eigenvalue structure directly.
