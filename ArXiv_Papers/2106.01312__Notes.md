## Abstract

Quantum mechanics is one of the basic theories of modern physics. Here, the famous Schrödinger equation and the differential operators representing mechanical quantities in quantum mechanics are derived, just based on the principle that the translation invariance (symmetry) of a system in Hamiltonian mechanics should be preserved in quantum mechanics. Moreover, according to the form of the differential operators, the commutation relation in quantum mechanics between the generalized coordinate and the generalized momentum can be directly obtained. We believe that the results in this paper are very useful for understanding the physical origin of quantum mechanics.
