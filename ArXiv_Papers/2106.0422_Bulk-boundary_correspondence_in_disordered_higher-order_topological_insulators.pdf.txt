In this work, we study the disorder effects on the bulk-boundary correspondence of twodimensional higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs). We concentrate on two cases: (i) bulkcorner correspondence, (ii) edge-corner correspondence. For the bulk-corner correspondence case, we demonstrate the existence of the mobility gaps and clarify the related topological invariant that characterizes the mobility gap. Furthermore, we find that, while the system preserves the bulkcorner correspondence in the presence of disorder, the corner states are protected by the mobility gap instead of the bulk gap. For the edge-corner correspondence case, we show that the bulk mobility gap and edge band gaps of HOTIs are no longer closed simultaneously. Therefore, a rich phase diagram is obtained, including various disorder-induced phase transition processes. Notably, a disorder-induced transition from the non-trivial to trivial phase is realized, distinguishing the HOTIs from the other topological states. Our results deepen the understanding of bulk-boundary correspondence and enrich the topological phase transitions of disordered HOTIs.

I. INTRODUCTION
The bulk-boundary correspondence is one of the most important features of the topological phase of matter. For conventional TIs, the bulk-boundary correspondence is often referred to as bulk-edge correspondence indicating that d dimensions systems have gapless states on the (d-1)-dimensional boundary. Recently, the higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) are introduced as a novel topological state1­56. Generally, the HOTIs require the existence of both bulk energy gap and the non-trivial gaps of edge or surface states10,11 to ensure the existence of corner or hinge states. Accordingly, the concept of the bulk-boundary correspondence for HOTIs is generalized to bulk-corner correspondence and edgecorner correspondence57­60. For example, for a twodimensional HOTI10 constructed by the quantum spin Hall model57,58, the helical edge states are gapped out with mass domains sitting at the edges of the sample, which guarantee the existence of the corner states and the non-trivial quadrupole moment1,2,61­63. If the bulk energy gap and edge band gaps of HOTIs are closed simultaneously, the HOTIs are considered to fall into the bulk-corner correspondence case57,58. On the other hand, when the edge band gap of HOTI is closed without bulk gap closing59,60, the system belongs to the edgecorner correspondence instead of bulk-corner correspondence cases.
Meanwhile, the study on the disorder-induced phase transitions of higher-order topological phases also attracted great interest very recently64­73. The disorderinduced phase transitions in HOTIs64,65 show distinct features such as higher-order topological Anderson insulators (HOTAIs), comparing to those in conventional topological phases74­83. The numerical calculations indicate that the energy gap closes and reopens by the disorder, and the topological phase transitions are

observed64,65. In the study of Yang et al.65, the existence of extended bulk states is discussed. Furthermore, the presence of mobility edge is also clarified. In Li et al.'s study, however, they pay more attention to the edge band gaps. The edge band gaps are considered to be closed and reopened64. They also notice that the localization length along a specific direction diverges for samples under open boundary conditions, similar to those in one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models74.
However, previous studies mainly concentrated on the evolution of the bulk energy gap and edge energy gap. Although the mobility gap for HOTIs has been discussed, the topological invariant protected by the mobility gap is still unclear80­83. Furthermore, to demonstrate the influence of disorder on the bulk-corner correspondence, it is of great value to study the evolutions of mobility gaps and the correlated topological invariant. More importantly, due to the breakdown of bulk-corner correspondence, the disorder-induced gap closing and the related topological phase transitions of HOTI with edge-corner correspondence should be abundant. It is essential to study the disorder-induced gap closing of HOTIs, which will deepen the understanding of the topological features of the disordered HOTIs.
In this paper, we study the disorder effects on the evolution of both edge and bulk gaps, as well as the bulk-boundary correspondence in HOTIs. We investigate both the bulk-corner correspondence and edgecorner correspondence cases. For the bulk-corner correspondence case, we first demonstrate the existence of mobility gaps. Further, the topological invariant named as spin Chern number84­86 Cs is revealed to characterize the bulk states. By comparing the spin Chern number with the quadrupole moment, we find bulk-corner correspondence of the HOTIs remains intact in the presence of disorder. A phase diagram is given to elucidate the evolution of the mobility gap by varying the disorder strength.

2

For the edge-corner correspondence case, the disorderinduced edge energy gap closing is achieved. Importantly, unlike the previously discovered HOTAI, a phase transition from topological non-trivial phases to trivial ones is identified due to the competition between two renormalized parameters. In addition, a variety of gap-closing processes with disorder strength W  5t (where the band renormalization dominates) are obtained, which enriches the disorder-induced phase transitions of HOTIs.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we present the details of the model and the methods. In Sec. III, we concentrate on the gap closing and phase transitions of the bulk-corner correspondence cases. In Sec. IV, The edge-corner correspondence cases are considered. Finally, a brief discussion and summary are presented in Sec. V.

II. MODEL AND METHODS

Following previous studies, the Hamiltonian can be written as30,59:

H(k) = [-m + t cos kx + t cos ky]zz

+  sin kxxz -  sin kyyz

(1)

+ (kx, ky)0x,

in the basis (A, A, B, B) with A, B (, ) representing the orbit (spin) degrees of freedom. The Pauli matrices
(identity matrix) x/y/z (0) and x/y/z (0) act on orbit and spin space, respectively. m,  and t are model pa-
rameters and we set  = t throughout the paper. Here
(kx, ky) = 0 + x cos kx + y cos ky with x = -y. If (kx, ky) = 0, the Hamiltonian is exactly the BernevigHughes-Zhang (BHZ) model31 and can describe a quan-
tum spin-Hall effect with a pair of helical edge modes.
Generally, when (kx, ky) = 0 , the edge helical states with opposite group velocities will couple and gapped out
[see Fig. 1(a)]. To be specific, the (x cos kx - x cos ky) can create the mass domain walls along the edge of the
sample and lead to a HOTI with corner states. Impor-
tantly, the bulk-corner correspondence exists only when
0 = 0 and the Hamiltonian has the edge-corner correspondence instead for 0 = 059 [see appendix for more details].
Before starting calculation, we define the quadrupole moment64,65:

Qxy

=

1 Im{log[det(U qU ) 2

det(q)]},

(2)

where q  exp[i2xy/(N 2)]. N is the sample size and U
is constructed by the eigenvalues of occupied states with the projection operator Pr = U U . x (y) is the coordinate operator along x (y) direction. Note that Qxy is quantized since the Hamiltonian H has the chiral symmetry S = 0y, i.e. SH(k)S-1 = -H(k).
In addition to the quadrupole moment Qxy, we will use the spin Chern number Cs = |C+ - C-|/284­86. Here the

For clean samples, the edge band gap along x and y directions are f (m, 0, x) and f (m, 0, y), respectively. f (m, 0, x/y) is a function of m, 0 and x/y. When f (m, 0, x) > 0 and f (m, 0, y) < 0, the edge band gaps construct the mass domain walls. The red and blue arrows are the helical edge states. We concentrate on the edge band gap along y direction.

|n,  is the eigenvector for site n and orbit . P± = U±U± are the projection operators for different spin components, and U± are determined from the eigenvectors of
Pr(0z)Pr. Although the spin up () and spin down ()
parts of the Hamiltonian are coupled by (kx, ky), the
spin Chern number is still well defined when the eigen-

value of Pr(0z)Pr has a gap84. Cs = 1 suggests the

existence of edge states and the non-trivial features of

bulk states.

At last, the Anderson disorder is introduced as72 Hnw = diag{1n, 2n}  z, to preserve the symmetry SHnwS-1 = -Hnw. The random onsite potential 1n, 2n for site n satisfy the uniform distribution 1n, 2n  [-W/2, W/2] with the disorder strength W . For a weak disorder strength,

III. HOTI WITH BULK-CORNER CORRESPONDENCE
Different from the traditional two-dimensional topological insulators, the HOTIs could have the bulk-corner correspondence or edge-corner correspondence59. In this section, we consider 0 = 0 in Eq. (1) and the Hamiltonian of the HOTI has the bulk-corner correspondence.

3

A. mobility gap and the related topological invariant
For the clean HOTIs with bulk-corner correspondence, the evolutions of the bulk energy gap are correlated with the edge band gaps and the topological phase transitions. To be specific, the bulk energy gap closing determines the topological phase transition of the HOTIs in the same way as in the traditional topological insulators. However, when the disorder is considered, the bulk gap will be replaced by the mobility gap for both the 2D traditional topological insulators80­83 and HOTIs64.
To demonstrate the existence of the mobility gap of HOTI, we compare the Qxy with both the bulk energy gap and the edge energy gap and plot them as a function of the disorder strength W in Fig. 2. The Qxy and the bulk energy gap are evaluated utilizing a square sample with size N [see Fig. 1(b)] under periodic boundary conditions in both x and y directions. On the other hand, the edge energy gap is calculated with open and periodic boundary conditions in x and y directions, respectively. Because the whole spectrum has 4N 2 eigenvalues in total as well as symmetry S, The energy gap is determined by the (2N 2 + 1)-th eigenvalue E2N2+1 and the energy gap closes when E2N2+1 = 0.
In Figs. 2(a) and (d), the system starts from a HOTI phase, and a normal insulator exists in the clean limit.

(c) and (d) are the scaling of Qxy and Cs, respectively. Disorder strength is fixed at W = 4t with m = t. Other parameters are the same as those in Fig. 2.

For a weak disorder, one can see a disorder-induced topological phase transition from a normal insulator to a HOTI phase in Fig. 2 (d) and the bulk energy gap closes in Fig. 2 (e), which correspond to the creation of the HOTAI. When the disorder is strong enough, bulk energy gaps are closed for both HOTIs and HOTAIs in Figs .2(b) and (e). Notably, the Qxy is still quantized when the bulk energy gap closes at W  4t. This means that the topological phase transition from HOTI to normal insulator is independent of the bulk energy gap when disorder W  4t.
In order to clarify the localization properties of bulk states, we calculate the average density of states (DOS) and the geometric average DOS80­82 given by

ave, type and the ratio type/ave are also plotted as
a function of W . Generally, type is smaller than ave, type/ave tends to be finite80­82 for extended states and
type/ave will approach zero when the states are much
more localized. In Fig. 2(c) when W > 4t, the density

of state ave = 0 meaning that the bulk energy gap dis-

appears. In this circumstance, the quantized quadrupole

moment Qxy = 1/2 is protected by the mobility gap instead. By further increasing disorder strength to W  6t,

type/ave shows a peak and Qxy decreases to about 1/4 [half of its quantized value], meaning that the mobility

gap is closed with the emergence of delocalized states at

E = 0.

In two dimensions, all the states tend to be localized

in the presence of disorder, and the emergence of de-

localized states is generally accompanied by topological

invariants87,88. Therefore, in the following, we explore the topological invariants that characterize the topological phase in the mobility gap. To start with, we plot the quadrupole moment Qxy as shown in Fig. 3(c). Unfortunately, we find that the quantization of Qxy = 0.5 is destroyed when the Fermi energy slightly deviates from E = 0. That's because the quadrupole moment Qxy is protected by the symmetry S = 0y, which is preserved only when the system is half-filled, namely E = 0.
Next, we consider the spin Chern number Cs = 1 to distinguish the HOTI from the trivial ones, because Eq. (1) can be viewed as the quantum spin Hall state with gapped edge states and the bulk-edge correspondence also holds (see appendix). Different from the Chern number, Cs = 1 can determine the existence of gapped edge states, which are essential for HOTIs. As illustrated in Figs. 3(a) and (b), the spin Chern number Cs perfectly fits the evolution of Qxy by increasing disorder strength. The quadrupole moment equals to 0.5 when Cs = 1. Besides, Cs also captures the existence of HOTAI, shown in Fig. 3(b). Thus, it is appropriate to adopt the spin Chern number to determine HOTIs within the mobility gap. Regarding SHS-1 = -H, the system is symmetric about E = 0, and we only pay attention to E  0 in all our calculations. In Fig. 3(d), we do finite-size scaling of Cs and find Cs  1 for energy roughly within E  [0, t]. This confirms the quantization of Cs within the entire mobility gap of the disordered HOTIs.
Generally, the Cs = 1 only ensures the existence of gapped edge states within the mobility gap. Nevertheless, due to the overlaps between Qxy and Cs curves [see Figs. 3(a) and (b)], it is appropriate to conclude that Cs = 1 accompanied with Qxy = 0.5 at E = 0 should also ensure the existence of corner states in the mobility gap. This interprets why the HOTIs could have the bulk-corner correspondence.

B. mobility gap closing and phase transition
In order to study the evolution of the mobility gap versus disorder, we calculate the normalized localization length89­94 y/N along y direction with m = t. The localized and delocalized states can be distinguished by the finite-size scaling analysis of y/N . y/N decreases (increases) for localized (extended) states with N increasing, while y/N is independent of N at critical points. For small disorder strength W in Figs. 4(a)-(c), the system shows a mobility gap near E = 0 with y/N decreasing, and then it encounters a critical point. Notably, for W = 4t, the critical point is at E  t, which is consistent with the scaling of Cs in Fig. 3(d).
With an increase of W , the mobility gap decreases and eventually disappears when W  7t [see Figs. 4(d)-(h)], where all the states are localized for the entire energy range. Note that similar results can also be found for HOTAI with m = 2.05t, as shown in the appendix.
To further demonstrate that the HOTI becomes a trivial insulator when the mobility gap closes, we perform the scaling analysis of the spin Chern number and quadrupole moment under different disorder strengths. As shown in Figs. 5(a) and (b), Cs  1 in the thermodynamic limit when W < 6.8t, while Qxy increases monotonously with the increase of N in this disorder region. On the other hand, when W > 6.8t, both Qxy and Cs decrease with increasing N , and they tend to approach zero for larger N . These results are in accordance with those in Fig. 3(a), where the Cs and Qxy curves almost overlap.
We summarize the above results in the phase diagram in Fig. 5(c). The blue squares are obtained by scaling of the normalized localization length in Fig. 4, while the red square is obtained with the help of Fig. 5(a) and (b). One can see the HOTAIs (with Qxy = 0.5) and the trivial insulator phase (with Qxy = 0.0) are separated

by the mobility edge. Therefore, we conclude that the HOTIs or HOTAIs are protected by the mobility gap in the presence of disorder.
We close this section by discussing the relation between the edge band gap and the existence of corner states. The inset of Fig. 2(b) shows the edge band gap and bulk band gap are closed simultaneously at W  4t. However, Qxy  0.5 is still quantized in this case. Therefore, it is appropriate to deduce that the edge band still has the non-trivial mass domain walls to host the corner states. Meanwhile, the mass-domain walls induced by edge gaps are filled with localized states. At present, it is difficult to clearly demonstrate whether these edge gaps are closed or not due to the localized states. A careful characterization of edge states under strong disorder requires further investigation.

IV. HOTI WITH EDGE-CORNER CORRESPONDENCE
This section focuses on HOTIs with edge-corner correspondence, where the bulk-corner correspondence breaks down. In particular, we pay attention to the weak disorder strength cases so that the SCBA can describe the disorder-induced band renormalization.

A. edge band gap closing
Next, we show that the bulk-corner correspondence breaks down for the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) with 0 = 0. We plot the Qxy and the bulk energy gap as a function of W and 0 in Fig. 6(a) and (b), respectively. The quantized quadrupole moment Qxy = 0.5 (the HOTIs) region decreases with 0 increasing in Fig. 6(a), while the bulk energy gap is independent of 0 as shown in Fig. 6(b). This is inconsistent with the fact that the bulk energy gap of clean samples is independent of 0 for

such cases. Therefore, the bulk-corner correspondence no longer holds.
To gain further insight into the edge-corner correspondence of the system, we compare the spin Chern number Cs with the quadrupole moment Qxy and plot them against W with fixed 0 = 0.4t as shown in Fig. 6(c1). Notably, the spin Chern number Cs  1 is more robust than the quadrupole moment Qxy = 0.5, and it remains a quantized value for W < 5t. These results are distinct from the bulk-corner correspondence cases where Cs and Qxy curves overlap as shown in Figs. 3(a) and (b). Furthermore, we show the bulk and edge energy gaps in Figs. 6(c1) and (c2), to compare Cs and Qxy with the two energy gaps. It is clear that the robustness of Qxy is mainly determined by the edge band gap closing at W  3t, while Cs remains quantized until the bulk energy gap closes at W  4.5t. This justifies the fact that Qxy = 0.5 results from the mass domain walls of edge modes while Cs is protected by the bulk gap.
Now we come to summarize the gap closing process for the edge-corner correspondence case in Fig. 6(d). In the clean limit, the system is topological non-trivial, with Cs = 1 and Qxy = 0.5 that lead to helical edge modes in the bulk gap and corn states in the edge gap. By turning on W , the edge gap fills up and closes, destroying the quantized quadrupole moment, i.e., Qxy = 0.5. Further increasing W , the bulk energy gap is closed while Cs is still quantized because of the mobility bulk gap. At last,

both Cs and Qxy equal to zero, and the system is an Anderson insulator when the mobility gap is closed. We note that, because the bulk and edges gaps close simultaneously in Sec. III with 0 = 0, Cs and Qxy curves overlap, and the system recovers the bulk-corner correspondence.
At last, we evaluate the localization length y along y direction with periodic and open boundary conditions to accurately determine the edge and bulk energy gap closing points, respectively. In Fig. 7(b), the localization length has a peak sitting at W  3.1t under the open boundary condition. Besides, the position is independent of the sample size. On the other hand, such a peak disappears in the periodic boundary cases [see Fig. 7(c)], which implies that the peak shown in Fig. 7(b) should be related to the features of edge states64. Next, we compare y with the scaling of Qxy, as shown in Fig. 7(a). Qxy gradually loses quantization near the peak at W  3.1t, where Qxy almost decreases to half of its quantized value. Moreover, we plot the disorder-averaged wave functions of corner states along y direction |(ix = 1, iy)|2 against W with iy  [1, N ] explicitly. Figure 7(c) clearly shows that the corner states spread into the edge along direction y and disappear when W  3.1t. Thus, we conclude that the sharp peak of y can be used to accurately determine the edge band gap closing point where the corner states disappear due to the edge-corner correspondence.

a phase transition from Qxy = 0.5 (non-trivial) to 0 (trivial). In the following, we will clarify it by showing that
the renormalization to both topological mass m and 0 term can give rise to a much richer phase diagram.
Generally, the topological invariants Cs and Qxy of the Hamiltonian H(k) are determined by m, 0 and x,y. In particular, the edge gap in x (y) direction is determined by a function ¯ x,y = f (m, 0, x,y). When the gap ¯ x and ¯ y have opposite sign, there are corner states near the domain walls, giving rise to Qxy = 0.5. Therefore, we focus on the renormalization of 0 and m in the following. In the presence of disorder, the band struc-
ture is normalized by the disorder-induced self-energy r according to the SCBA. r can be decomposed as: r = ij rijij with i, j = 0, x, y, z. The mass m and 0 are renormalized into mR  m + mr = m - rzz and 0R  0 + 0r = 0 + r0x, respectively. In Fig. 8(a), the phase boundary predicted by SCBA is perfectly fitted
to gap-closing points indicated by the maximum localiza-
tion length. This suggests that the phase transition from
non-trivial to trivial can be described by the disorderinduced self-energy r. It is important to notice that
the disorder-induced renormalization suggests mr < 0 and 0r > 0 for various 0 when 0 = 0, shown in Figs. 8(b) and (c).
Now we can explain the disorder-induced phase tran-
sition from Qxy = 0.5 to Qxy = 0. Figure 8(d) shows the phase diagram in the clean limit with phase boundaries
determined by the edge band gap closing and spin Chern
number [see appendix for more details]. If we start from
the red square (with 0 = 0.4t and m = t) in Fig. 8(d), m is renormalized to mR < m, i.e., the red square shifts to the white square, and the sample tends to be more

To elucidate the edge band gap closing under disorder, we evaluate the disorder-induced band renormalization using the SCBA method. At first glance, it seems to contradict the previous theory of disorder-induced topo-

FIG. 9: (Color online). (a) The flow under different parameters with disorder strength W  [0, 5t]. The black (red) squares correspond to W = 0 (W = 5t). The direction of the arrows suggests that disorder strength W increases. All the curves are obtained based on the SCBA calculations. The arrows with dashed line are the three conditions already known. Four solid lines are four possible gap closing cases shown in (b)-(e). Parameter is set as x = 0.5t. The phase boundary is m = 2t - 20. The sample size is N = 30.

topological. It is consistent with the previous studies of disorder-induced topological Anderson insulators. However, since 0 = 0, 0 is also renormalized along the vertical direction so that 0R increases. In addition, 0r is larger than mr when W  5t, as shown in Fig. 8(b) and (c). The white square continuously shifts to the black square by crossing the phase boundary when the disorder is strong enough. Therefore, a phase transition from Qxy = 0.5 to Qxy = 0 happens with Cs = 1 unchanged. These predictions are consistent with the results shown in Fig. 6(c). Furthermore, mr is almost independent of 0, while 0r increases with an increase of 0. Thus, the critical disorder strength between Qxy = 0.5 and Qxy = 0 decreases for larger 0. This explains what we observe in Fig. 6(a).
In the following, let us show that the renormalization to both m and 0 can give rise to much richer phase transitions than the previously discovered TAI. As shown in Fig .9(a), we plot some possible paths in (m, 0) space. Similar to Fig. 8(d), the red square and the black square correspond to the starting point (W = 0) and the final point (W=5t), respectively. The solid and dashed lines

connecting the red and black squares are paths obtained by SCBA. The arrow suggests the renormalization direction as the disorder strength W increases.
Let us verify the three dashed lines (that starting from 0 = 0 and 0 = 0.4) in Fig. 9(a), which are the three paths studied in previous sections. For 0 = 0, two different renormalization paths are given for m = t and m = 2.05t. They are correlated with Figs. 3(a) and (b) as follow. Qxy = 0.5 and Cs = 1 are unchanged for Fig. 3(a), while the trivial one (Qxy = 0 and Cs = 0) is transformed into nontrivial with Qxy = 0.5 and Cs = 1 for Fig. 3(a). These two paths are traditional since 0 = 0, and only m is renormalized. On the other hand, for the path starting from 0 = 0.4t and m = t as discussed in Fig. 9(a), Qxy = 0.5 decreases to zero with Cs = 1 which corresponds to the case in Fig. 6(c)
In addition, four new paths marked with the solid lines are shown in Fig. 9(a). First, the yellow path suggests that no phase transition exists, in agreement with the plot of Cs and Qxy in Fig. 9(b). Then, even when the starting point moves close to the phase boundary [see solid blue line in Fig. 9(a)] the HOTAI is not available for larger 0 as verified in Fig. 9(c). Nevertheless, figure 9(d) shows that rich phase transitions are possible as indicated by the magenta line in Fig. 9(a). The spin Chern number is changed Cs = 0  1 with the renormalized topological mass mR  2t and then the edge band gap is closed with Qxy  0.5 [see appendix for more details]. At last, we find only Cs = 0  1 for the case shown in Fig. 9(e).
V. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY
In section III, we have discussed the existence of massdomain-walls induced by edge gaps for bulk-corner correspondence case with 0 = 0, since Qxy  0.5 for the strong disorder strength. However, whether such edge gaps are closed or not is still unclear because of the existence of the localized bulk states. Moreover, in section IV, when the bulk-corner correspondence breaks down by disorder for 0 = 0, the edge band gap is closed and the mobility gap is still alive. Due to the specific characteristics of HOTIs without bulk-corner correspondence, the gap closing of HOTIs under strong disorder could be more complicated. These problems deserve further investigation.
In summary, we studied the gap closing for HOTIs with or without bulk-corner correspondence. For the bulk-corner correspondence case, we found that the bulkcorner correspondence still holds after considering the disorder effect. The existence of the mobility gap was also revealed. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the mobility gap closing induces the phase transition from HOTIs to Anderson insulator, and the quadrupole moment Qxy approaches zero under strong disorder correspondingly. We concentrated on the weak disorder strength regions for the edge-corner correspondence case, where

the disorder-induced band renormalization dominates. Importantly, the disorder-induced phase transition from Qxy = 0.5 to Qxy = 0 was obtained. This transition originates from the disorder-induced renormalization of both m and 0, distinct from the HOTAI cases. We found several phase transitions based on the renormalization, and the corresponding gap closing was also clarified.

Appendix A: the mobility gap for HOTAI
We present the mobility gap evolution of the HOTAI shown in Fig. 3(b) with m = 2.05t. The main results are similar to those in Fig. 4. The mobility gap first increases, shown in Fig. 10(h). Then, the mobility gap decreases due to the localization effect.

Appendix B: The bulk-corner, edge-corner, and bulk-edge correspondence
For the model shown in Eq. (1), there are three possible cases for the bulk-boundary correspondence. (i) When bulk-corner correspondence holds, the bulk energy (mobility) and edge band gap should be closed simultaneously with Qxy varying. (ii) The bulk-edge correspondence in this paper means that Cs = 1 ensures the ex-

9

istence of edge states with or without edge band gaps, where Cs changes only when the bulk energy (mobility) gap is closed. (iii) For edge-corner correspondence, Qxy that determines the corner states is correlated with the edge band gap instead of bulk energy gap.
To clarify the bulk-corner, bulk-edge, and edge-corner correspondence59, we plot the evolution of bulk energy gap and edge band gap in Figs. 11(a) and (b) for samples without disorder. Fig. 11(c) shows the spin Chern number Cs. For 0 = 0, the bulk gap is closed when m = 2t. Furthermore, Cs and Qxy change simultaneously, where the bulk-edge and bulk-corner correspondence exist. When 0 = 0, the bulk energy gap is closed only when (m = 0, 0 = 0) and (m = 0, 0 = t) [see Fig. 11(a)]. For the rest regions, the bulk gap always

exists. However, Cs changes only when m = 2t, which is independent of 0 [see Fig. 11(c)]. Thus, the bulk-edge correspondence breaks down. By comparing the bulk energy gap in Fig. 11(a) with Qxy shown in Fig. 11(b), it is obvious that the bulk-corner correspondence breaks. Nevertheless, the edge-corner correspondence exists. We note that, in Fig. 11(b), the bulk energy gap is used to replace the edge energy gap for convenience when the edge states are absent. Further, we compare the bulk energy gap in Figs. 11(d) and (e) and Cs shown in Fig. 9(d) and (e) and find that the bulk energy gap is not closed when Cs jumps from zero to one or vice versus when the bulk-edge correspondence breaks down. The Cs changes value only when m = 2t, which is corresponding to the gap closing condition in BHZ model.
