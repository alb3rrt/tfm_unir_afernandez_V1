## Abstract

Base on the above Witt's identity and the binomial theorem, we prove some new identities for the Euler polynomials briefly. In particular, some symmetry properties of Euler polynomials have been discovered, which implies many interesting identities (known or unknown), including the Kaneko-Momiyama type identities (shown by Wu, Sun, and Pan) and the Alzer-Kwong type identity for Euler polynomials.
