HANS HENRICH NEUMANN AND MAKOTO YAMASHITA
Abstract. We prove Lieb type convexity and concavity results for trace functionals associated with positive operator monotone (decreasing) functions and certain monotone concave functions. This gives a partial generalization of Hiai's recent work on trace functionals associated with power functions.

1. Introduction
In a breakthrough paper on concavity of quantum entropy [Lie73], Lieb proved concavity and convexity properties of functionals of the form
(A, B)  Tr(ApKBqK)
defined on the space of positive definite matrices. Since then this has been expanded in many ways, see [Eps73, CL99, CL08, Hia13, CFL16] and references therein. One definitive form is given by Hiai [Hia16], who proved joint convexity of functionals of the form
(A, B)  Tr h (A-p)-1/2(B-q)(A-p)-1/2 (A, B > 0)
for strictly positive maps  : Mm(C)  Mk(C),  : Mn(C)  Mk(C), 0 < p, q  1, and certain nondecreasing concave function h. In this short note we prove a variant of this result, where we allow functional calculus by arbitrary positive operator monotone decreasing functions inside positive maps instead of power maps, but impose a stronger condition on h. A similar result for the geometric mean of positive matrices [PW75] was recently proved by Kian and Seo [KS21].
Our proof is a combination Hiai's ingenuous use of Legendre transform that gives a variational formula of trace functionals associated with concave functions, and one-variate convexity of operator valued maps of the form h((f (A))) for operator monotone h and positive operator monotone decreasing f established by Kirihata and the second named author in [KY20], which was motivated by certain operator logconvexity of such f due to Ando and Hiai [AH11].
Besides allowing a bigger class of functions inside the positive maps  and , we also give analogous results in the framework of C-algebras endowed with tracial states. The overall strategy is essentially the same as the case of matrices, but we rely on Petz's work [Pet85,Pet87] on trace inequalities for tracial von Neumann algebras, and an adaptation of Hiai's variational method to this setting.

2. Preliminaries

We denote the set of positive invertible matrices by Mn(C)++, and the set of selfadjoint matrices by Mn(C)sa. A linear map  : Mn(C)  Mk(C) is strictly positive if it sends Mn(C)++ into Mk(C)++.
For positive numbers a and b, we denote their arithmetic and harmonic means by

a

b

=

a

+ 2

b

,

a

!

b

=

a-1

2 +

b-1 .

These admit obvious generalization to operator transforms for A, B  Mn(C)++. Let h(x) be a nondecreasing and concave function for x > 0, satisfying limx h(x)x-1 = 0. Its
Legendre transform is given by h(t) = inf tx - h(x).
x>0
Then h satisfies the same assumptions as h [Hia16, Lemma A.2].

Now, let us list key ingredients of our proof. First is the variational formula for trace functionals associated with concave functions.

Proposition 2.1 ([Hia16, Lemma A.2]). Let h be as above. For any positive matrix A  Mn(C)++, we have
Tr h(A) = inf Tr(AB - h(B)).
B Mn (C)++
Next is a stronger form of convexity for positive operator monotone functions, as follows.

Proposition 2.2 ([KY20, Theorem 3.1]1). Let g(x) be an operator monotone function, and f (x) be a positive operator monotone decreasing function, both for x > 0. For any strictly positive map  : Mn(C)  Mk(C), the map
Mn(C)++  Mk(C)sa, A  g((f (A)))
is convex.

We will use the consequence of the above for g(x) = -x-1, in the following form: (f (A))-1 is concave in A > 0 when f is positive operator monotone decreasing.
We also use the Jensen inequality and monotonicity for trace functionals, which can be stated as follows.

Proposition 2.3 ([HP03, Theorem 2.4]). Let f be a convex function defined on some interval J, and C1, . . . , Ck be elements of Mn(C) such that i CiCi = In. Then, for any A1, . . . , Ak  Mn(C)sa such that (Ai)  J, we have

Tr f

CiAiCi  Tr

Cif (Ai)Ci

i

i

We use this in the following form, by taking J = (0, ) and f = -h: let h(x) be a concave function for x > 0. Then A  Tr h(A) is concave for A  Mn(C)++. Thus, it is in fact enough to use the main
result of [Pet87].

Proposition 2.4. Let f (x) be a monotone function with domain J. Suppose that we have A  B and (A), (B)  J for A, B  Mn(C)sa. Then we have
Tr(f (A))  Tr(f (B)).

Proof. This is well known to experts, but here is a sketch of the proof. From the minimax principle, we see that the ordered eigenvalues of A and B satisfy i(A)  i(B) for i = 1, . . . , n. Collecting the inequalities f (i(A))  f (i(B)), we obtain the claim.

3. Main result

When h(x) is a real function defined for x > 0, put h~(x) = -h(x-1).

3.1. Convexity. When h(x) is an monotone function for x > 0 such that h~ is concave and limx0 h(x)x = 0, we put

h(t) = inf tx - ~h(x) = inf tx + h(x-1).

x>0

x>0

Note that h is well defined as the Legendre transform h~.

Furthermore, we will consider the class of functions h(x) for x > 0 satisfying

h(x  y)  h(x)  h(y)  h(x ! y).

(3.1)

The first inequality is the usual concavity condition. The second could be interpreted as concavity of h~, hence this class is closed under the transform h  h~. One motivating example comes from operator monotone functions.

Proposition 3.1. Suppose that h(x) is operator monotone for x > 0. Then it satisfies (3.1).

Proof. This observation can be traced back to [AH11], but let us repeat it here for the reader's convenience. First, operator monotonicity of h implies concavity h(x  y)  h(x)  h(y). Next, as h~ is also operator monotone, it is again concave. As remarked above, this can be expressed as h(x!y)  h(x)h(y) up to change of variables.

1We note an unfortunate typo in that paper, B++ in [KY20, Theorem 3.1] should read Bsa. 2

Remark 3.2. By Löwner's theorem, any operator monotone function h(x) for x > 0 can be written as

h(x) = c0 + c1x +

x - 1 x+

dµ()

for some c1  0 and a finite measure µ on [0, ). If µ does not have atom on 0, we have limx0 xh(x) = 0.

We are now ready to state and prove our main result.

Theorem 3.3. Suppose that h(x) is a monotone function for x > 0 such that h~ is concave, limx0 h(x)x = 0, and that h satisfies (3.1). Let f (x) and g(x) be positive operator monotone decreasing functions for x > 0, and let  : Mm(C)  Mk(C) and  : Mn(C)  Mk(C) be strictly positive maps. Then, the map
Mm(C)++ × Mn(C)++  R, (A, B)  Tr h (f (A))1/2(g(B))(f (A))1/2

is jointly convex.

Proof. Let us write A = (f (A)) and B = (g(B)). We have

Tr h (f (A))1/2(g(B))(f (A))1/2 = - Tr h~ A-1/2B-1A-1/2 .

Thus, it is enough to prove the joint concavity of Tr h~(A-1/2B-1A-1/2) in A and B. We closely follow the proof of [Hia16, Theorem 5.2]. We first get

Tr h~ A-1/2B-1A-1/2 =

inf

Tr Y A-1/2B-1A-1/2 - h(Y )

Y Mk(C)++

from Proposition 2.1. Putting Z = A-1/2Y A-1/2, we can rewrite this as

inf Tr Z1/2B-1Z1/2 - h(Z1/2AZ1/2) .
ZMk (C)++

(3.2)

Given Ai  Mm(C)++ and Bi  Mn(C)++ for i = 1, 2, let us fix Z0  Mk(C)++ that almost achieves the infimum (3.2) for A = A1  A2 and B = B1  B2. By Proposition 2.2 applied to the operator monotone function -x-1, the map

B  Z01/2B-1Z01/2 = Z0-1/2(g(B))Z0-1/2 -1 is concave, hence we have

Z01/2B-1Z01/2  Z01/2B1-1Z01/2  Z01/2B2-1Z01/2 .
As for the term involving A, by assumption on h the function h = h~ is concave and monotone. Thus C  Tr h(C) is concave and monotone for C  Mk(C)++ by Propositions 2.3 and 2.4. This observation and the concavity of A  Z0-1/2(f (A))-1Z0-1/2 imply that
A  - Tr h Z01/2AZ01/2 = - Tr h Z01/2(f (A))Z01/2
is concave, hence we obtain

- Tr h Z01/2AZ01/2  - Tr h Z01/2A1Z01/2  - Tr h Z01/2A2Z01/2 . Thus we see that (3.2) is bounded from below by

inf Tr
Z1 ,Z2

Z11/2B1-1Z11/2 - h

Z11/2 A1 Z11/2

+ Tr Z21/2B2-1Z21/2 - h Z21/2A2Z21/2

,

where Z1 and Z2 separately run over Mk(C)++. We thus obtained

Tr h~ A-1/2B-1A-1/2  Tr h~ A1-1/2B1-1A1-1/2  Tr h~ A2-1/2B2-1A2-1/2 ,

which is what we wanted.

The above theorem applies for the following cases.

· h(x) = log x; h(x) = 1 + log x. · h(x) = xr for 0 < r; h(x) = r1/(r+1)(1 + r-1)xr/(r+1). For r = 1 we recover [KY20, Theorem

4.2].

h(x) = -x-r

h(x)

= rr/(1-r)(r - 1)xr/(r-1).

Put

another

way,

Tr (f (A))1/2(g(B))(f (A))1/2 -r

is concave in A and B for such r.

Remark 3.4. If h is operator monotone, we can avoid using Propositions 2.3 and 2.4 as the map Mm(C)++  Mk(C)++, A  -h(Z01/2(f (A))Z01/2)
would be operator concave. The above examples all satisfy this additional assumption.

Remark 3.5. By [Hia16, Theorem 5.2],

Tr h (A-p)-1/2(B-q)(A-p)-1/2

is convex if h(x) is a nondecreasing function for x > 0 such that either of h(x-(1+p)) or h(x-(1+q)) is convex. The above examples of h fall under this setting. The bound on the exponent of -x-r is also
sharp by [Hia13].

3.2. Concavity. The concave analogue, which is easier, goes as follows.

Theorem 3.6. Let h(x) be a concave monotone function for x > 0 such that limx h(x)x-1 = 0, and that h satisfies (3.1). Let f (x) and g(x) be positive operator monotone functions for x > 0, and let  : Mm(C)  Mk(C) and  : Mn(C)  Mk(C) be strictly positive maps. Then, the map
Mm(C)++ × Mn(C)++  R, (A, B)  Tr h (f (A))1/2(g(B))(f (A))1/2
is jointly concave.

We omit the proof as it is completely analogous to that of Theorem 3.3. The above theorem applies

for the following cases.

· h(x) = log x; h(x) = 1 + log x.

·

h(x) = xr

for

0<r

;

h(x)

= rr/(1-r)(r - 1)xr/(r-1).

· h(x) = -x-r for 0 < r; h(x) = r1/(r+1)(1 + r-1)xr/(r+1).

4. C-algebraic setting

The above results have straightforward generalization to unital C-algebras with tracial states. In
this section A, B, and C denote unital C-algebras, and  denotes a tracial state on C. We use notations such as A++ and Asa analogous to the case of matrix algebras.
First let us establish a generalization of Proposition 2.1 in this setting.

Proposition 4.1. Let h(x) be a concave function for x > 0 such that limx h(x)x-1 = 0. For any A  C++, we have
 (h(A)) = inf  (AB - h(B)).
BC++

Proof. Let M be the von Neumann algebraic closure of C in the GNS representation associated with  .
We denote the extension of  to M again by  . Let N be the von Neumann subalgebra of M generated
by A. Then there is a (unique)  -preserving conditional expectation E : M  N. As -h(x) is convex for x > 0, and E is unital positive map, we have

- (h(E(B)))  - (E(h(B))) = - (h(B))

for any B  M++ by [Pet87, Corollary]. Combined with  (AB) =  (AE(B)), we obtain

inf  (AB - h(B)) = inf  (AB - h(B)).

BM++

BN++

The right hand side is equal to inff  (Af (A) - h(f (A))), where f runs over bounded nonnegative Borel measurable functions on (A), hence it is equal to h(A). By a standard approximation argument, the

same infimum is achieved when f runs over nonnegative continuous functions on (A).

Finally, together with the obvious inequality

we obtain the claim.

inf  (AB - h(B))  inf  (AB - h(B)).

BM++

BC++

Proposition 2.2 holds in this setting, as [KY20, Theorem 3.1] was already proved for in such generality. The rest is quite well known, as follows.

Proposition 4.2 ([HK10]). Let f be a convex function defined on some interval J, and C1, . . . , Ck be elements of A such that i CiCi = 1. Then, for any A1, . . . , Ak  Asa such that (Ai)  J, we have

f

CiAiCi

i



Cif (Ai)Ci

Again the setting of [Pet87] is enough for us, as we only need to deal with convex functions defined for x > 0.

Proposition 4.3 ([Pet85, Theorem 2]). Let f (x) be a monotone function with domain J. Suppose that we have A  B and (A), (B)  J for A, B  Asa. Then we have
 (f (A))   (f (B)).

With above results at hand, the proof of our main results carry over to C-algebraic setting, and we obtain the following.

Theorem 4.4. Let f (x), g(x), and h(x) be real functions for x > 0 as in Theorem 3.3. Let  : A  C and  : B  C be strictly positive maps. Then the map

A++ × B++  R, (A, B)   h (f (A))1/2(g(B))(f (A))1/2

(4.1)

is jointly convex.

Theorem 4.5. Let f (x), g(x), and h(x) be real functions for x > 0 as in Theorem 3.6. Let  : A  C and  : B  C be strictly positive maps. Then, the map
A++ × B++  R, (A, B)   h (f (A))1/2(g(B))(f (A))1/2

is jointly concave.
