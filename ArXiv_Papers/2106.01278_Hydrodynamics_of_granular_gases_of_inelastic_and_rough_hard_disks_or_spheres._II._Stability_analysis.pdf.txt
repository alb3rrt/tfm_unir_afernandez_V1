Conditions for the stability under linear perturbations around the homogeneous cooling state are studied for dilute granular gases of inelastic and rough hard disks or spheres with constant coefficients of normal () and tangential () restitution. After a formally exact linear stability analysis of the Navier­Stokes­Fourier hydrodynamic equations in terms of the translational (dt) and rotational (dr) degrees of freedom, the transport coefficients derived in the companion paper [A. Meg´ias and A. Santos, "Hydrodynamics of granular gases of inelastic and rough hard disks or spheres. I. Transport coefficients"] are employed. Known results for hard spheres [V. Garzo´, A. Santos, and G. M. Kremer, Phys. Rev. E 97, 052901 (2018)] are recovered by setting dt = dr = 3, while novel results for hard disks (dt = 2, dr = 1) are obtained. In the latter case, a high-inelasticity peculiar region in the (, ) parameter space is found, inside which the critical wave number associated with the longitudinal modes diverges. Comparison with event-driven molecular dynamics simulations for hard disks shows that this region of absolute instability may be an artifact of the extrapolation to high inelasticity of the approximations made in the derivation of the transport coefficients, although it signals a strong unstable characterization of this parameter zone. In the case of moderate inelasticity ( = 0.7), on the other hand, a good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the simulation results is found.

I. INTRODUCTION
Hard disks and spheres are very common models for describing fluids. In the molecular case, energy is conserved upon collisions, which are set to be elastic. As a consequence, the equilibrium state is obviously stable. In contrast, a distinctive feature of a granular gas, as compared to a common fluid, is the possible instability of spatially uniform states and the associated appearance of structure formations (clusters and vortices). Characterization of the spontaneous formation of these instabilities has been widely studied for granular gases modeled as inelastic but smooth particles [1­8]. In these systems, it is always possible to find a range of parameters and perturbation wave numbers where a hydrodynamic description holds and instabilities are suppressed. In recent years, this study has been expanded to the case of rough spheres [9, 10], where a dual role of roughness on the instability has been observed.
Structure phenomena are important and appealing from a physical point of view. At a cosmological level, whereas the universe is considered to be generally isotropic and homogeneous, clustering is essential to forge galaxies and is present in planetary systems, dust agglomerations, planet rings, etc. Moreover, vortex formation can remind the rotational motion of disk or spiral galaxies like our Milky Way. From that point of view, granular gases, apart from their intrinsic interest,

can serve as useful examples for the formation of clusters and vortices. On the other hand, whereas attractive gravitational forces are the key of the clustering in the universe, in a granular gas the inelastic nature of the interacting particles is enough to produce it. Even more, the instabilities in self-gravitating granular gas systems has also been recently studied [11]. A similarity aspect between both classes of systems is that in cosmology one needs primordial perturbations in the early universe for the formation of agglomerations, while in a granular gas one can observe cluster formation spontaneously due to the growth of a given long enough perturbation. Furthermore, granular friction effects are known to have an influence on some astronomical problems [12, 13].
In this paper, we consider a dilute granular gas modeled as a collection of hard spheres (HS) or hard disks (HS) which collide with constant coefficients of normal () and tangential () restitution; while 0 <   1 controls the degree of inelasticity, -1    1 measures the degree of surface roughness. In general, each particle is animated with dt components of the translational velocity v and dr components of the angular velocity , where (dt, dr) = (3, 3) and (2, 1) for HS and HD, respectively. Our main aim is to perform a linear stability analysis of the homogeneous cooling state (HCS) of the granular gas by means of a Navier­Stokes­Fourier (NSF) hydrodynamic description in terms of the number of translational (dt) and rotational (dr) degrees of freedom, thus encompassing the HS and HD systems within a unified treatment, as done in previous works [14­16]. To that end, we make explicit use of the approximate expressions for the NSF transport coefficients derived in the companion paper I [16]. The HS results [10] are re-

2

covered by setting (dt, dr) = (3, 3), while novel results, to the best of our knowledge, are presented for HD by the choice (dt, dr) = (2, 1). In the latter case, we additionally present event-driven molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where the possible emergence of instability is monitored via a coarse-grained Kullback­Leibler divergence (KLD) [17, 18], which measures the degree of spatial heterogeneities, as well as by the evolution of other relevant quantities. As we will see, our results do not confirm previous studies [19], where different cooling laws for rotational and translational temperatures were reported.
The paper is structured as follows. In Sec. II, the NSF hydrodynamic equations are presented for a granular gas in terms of the translational (dt) and rotational (dr) degrees of freedom. Afterwards, the linear stability analysis of the dt + 2 hydrodynamic equations around the HCS is completed in Sec. III in a formally exact way, that is, without assuming any particular form for the NSF transport coefficients. Next, in Sec. IV, use is made of the approximate transport coefficients computed in Ref. [16] and the results of the stability analysis are discussed. To clarify some unexpected outcomes in the HD case, our MD simulation results are exposed in Sec. V. Finally, concluding remarks of the work are presented in Sec. VI.

II. NAVIER­STOKES­FOURIER HYDRODYNAMIC EQUATIONS

Let us consider a dilute granular gas made of identical HD (dt = 2, dr = 1) or HS (dt = dr = 3) of diameter , mass m, and moment of inertia I = m2/4, where  is the reduced moment of inertia. As said before, the collision dynamics will be assumed to be governed by two constant coefficients of restitution: normal () and tangential (). In a kinetic-theory description of the gas, the mesoscopic relevant quantity is the one-body velocity distribution function f (r, v, ; t), which obeys the Boltzmann equation.
At a macroscopic level, the adopted hydrodynamic fields are the number density n(r, t), the flow velocity u(r, t), and the temperature T (r, t), which are defined as

n(r, t) = dv d f (r, v, ; t),

In these equations, Dt = t + u ·  is the material time derivative, t is the HCS translational-to total temperature ratio, (0) is the Euler-order cooling rate,  is the

the velocity-divergence contribution to the cooling rate

By assuming a Chapman­Enskog expansion around

the HCS, the hydrodynamic equations to first order in

the hydrodynamic gradients (NSF order) become

Dtn = -n · u,

(2.2a)

The set of hydrodynamic equations (2.2) admits the HCS as a special solution, where   0 and thus the right-hand sides vanish. In that case, nH = const, uH = const, and TH = -H TH , where the quantities in the HCS are denoted with the subscript H. Thus,   H  nH TH, 0  0H  TH, and 0  0H  TH . Moreover, we introduce the thermal (translational) velocity in the HCS as vH = 2tTH /m.
In this section we study the stability of the HCS by means of a linear perturbation analysis of the NSF equations, Eqs. (2.2). This study is essential to characterize the well-known structure formation that appears in granular gases.

The perturbations around HCS state of the hydrodynamic fields are written as

It is now convenient to introduce the following scaled time and space variables,

(3.3)

The variable s measures the average number of collisions per particle, while  measures distance in units of a nominal mean free path (note that H /vH is independent of time). Given a perturbation field y(r, t), we define its Fourier transform as

yk(s) = d e-ik·y(r, t),

(3.4)

where i is the imaginary unit and k is the reduced wave vector. Thus, by defining the dimensionless quantities

(3.5)

and taking the Fourier transform of Eqs. (3.2), we obtain

Thus, the transverse vector U, decouples from the other three hydrodynamic fields. The solution to Eq.
(3.8) is

(3.9)

This characterizes the behavior of the dt -1 shear modes. They decay in time if the (reduced) wave number k is larger than a critical value

k =

.

(3.10)

On the other hand, if k < k, the shear modes grow in time and the HCS is unstable under those perturbations.

We consider now the three longitudinal modes k, k, and Uk, . Equations (3.6a), (3.6c), and (3.7) can be rewritten in matrix form as

IV. RESULTS
All the results in Secs. II and III are general in the sense that the explicit expressions for the dimensionless coefficients t, , , , b, , and µ have not been used. Those coefficients are functions of the coefficients of restitution (, ) and the reduced moment of inertia (), and they also depend on the number of degrees of freedom (dt and dr). As shown in paper I [16], the exact determination of t and  would require to solve the nonlinear Boltzmann equation for the zeroth-order HCS velocity distribution function f (0). The situation is even more involved in the case of the transport coefficients , , b, , and µ, whose determination, assuming f (0) were already known, would require to solve four linear

those previously derived [20] for HS (dt = dr = 3). For

completeness, we present in Table I the results for HD

(dt = 2, dr = 1), which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been shown before.

In the case of purely smooth particles ( = -1 or, in

our approach, dr  0), it is known that the HCS becomes unstable under perturbations with a sufficiently

small wave number (k < max{k, k }) [5, 8]. Interestingly, the quasismooth limit   -1 is singular and

yields   0 and µ  0. Consequently, according to

Eqs. (3.10) and (3.17), k, k  0. In the general case,

however, the HCS of a granular gas of rough HD or HS

can be unstable.

The curves for HD and HS are qualitatively similar. In

both systems, the real part of the sound modes ( ,1 and  ,2) remain negative for all k, thus indicating that those perturbative modes decay in time. On the other hand,

the shear () and heat ( ,3) modes grow in time if the wavenumber is smaller than k and k , respectively. Note that both frequencies ( and  ,3) tend to  in the small wave number limit k  0.

The scenario becomes much more complex for highly

inelastic particles, as illustrated in Fig. 2 at  = 0.2. In

the cases  = -0.5 [Fig. 2(a)] and  = 1 [Fig. 2(d)], the

HD and HS curves are still qualitatively similar. How-

ever, if  = 0 [Fig. 2(b)] or  = 0.5 [Fig. 2(c)], it turns

out that  ,3 > 0 for all k (i.e., k  ) in the HD case. From Eq. (3.17) we see that the locus in the plane  vs

The locus  = µ for HD is shown in Fig. 3(a) for

several values of . For each , k   in the region

at a point (, ) = (apex, apex), so that k = finite if  > apex, regardless of the value of . A similar behavior occurs in the HS case [10], except that the re-

Let us now visualize the dependence of the two critical

Depending on the values of  and , the most unstable mode could be either the transverse shear mode (if k > k ) or the longitudinal heat one (if k > k). Figure 6 depicts the locus k = k for HD and HS gases and the same values of  as in Figs. 4 and 5. In each case, k > k or k > k above or below the locus, respectively. We observe that the region where the heat mode dominates (k > k) is generally wider for HD than for HS; moreover, its area decreases as  increases for HS, while for HD it has a nonmonotonic -dependence with

The critical wave numbers k and k imply that the HCS becomes unstable if the (reduced) length of the system is larger than the critical value c = 2/kc, where kc = max{k, k }. In real units, the critical length is Lc = ( 2KvH /H)c, i.e.,

the reduced moment of inertia , Lc corresponds either to vortex or clustering instability in the region above or

Moreover, Lc  0 in the region below the locus on Fig. 3(a) for HD gases. In other words, in that region (hence-
forth referred to as the region of absolute instability), the
HCS would always be unstable for any system size. This
is a very strong statement that needs some discussion. Note that the condition   µ takes place for very
inelastic disks and never holds if  > 0.426. Since the ex-
plicit expressions for the transport coefficients derived in
paper I [16] made use of a Sonine-like approximation for the first-order distribution f (1) and a quasi-Maxwellian approximation for the zeroth-order distribution f (0), it
cannot be discarded that the combination of those two
approximations is responsible for the existence of the
region of absolute instability. If that were the case, a
more sophisticated approximation, for instance, by consistently including the cumulants of f (0) in the description, would erase such a region and  would be larger than µ for any , , and .
To put that possibility in context, let us recall the case
of purely smooth particles (dr  0). It is then easy to find that   µ if   (4 - dt)/(7dt - 4) (i.e.,  <

when the fourth-degree cumulant a2 of f (0) is neglected.

Paradoxically, if the role of a2 is introduced in a standard

way [5, 21], the interval of absolute instability grows to

  0.333 (HD) and   0.175 (HS). However, if the

cumulant a2 is taken into account in a more consistent way [22], it turns out that  > µ for all , both for

HD and HS. To make things even more complicated, it

is known that the cumulant expansion of f (0) for smooth

particles breaks down if  is small [23].

The situation is much more delicate in the case of

rough particles. First, instead of a single fourth-degree

cumulant of f (0), there are three (HD) or four (HS) in-

dependent fourth-degree cumulants [24]. Second, those

cumulants have been derived for HS [25­29], but not for

HD. And third, the known cumulants for HS can take

rather large values [27, 28], even for moderate inelastic-

ity, but this effect is expected to become more important

for HD [24].

Considering all of this, the prediction of a region of

absolute instability in the HD case must be taken with

much caution. In any case, one can conclude that the HD

gas typically develops clustering instabilities with much

larger reduced wave numbers than the HS gas if the val-

ues of  and  belong to the regions signaled in Figs. 3

and 5.

V. MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS FOR INELASTIC AND ROUGH HARD DISKS

Although the main aim of this paper is theoretical,

we present in this section some preliminary event-driven

molecular dynamics (MD) results for freely cooling HD

gases in order to check the stability of the HCS.

We have considered systems characterized by a certain

duced number density n2. The particles were enclosed

in a square box of side length L/ = N/n2 and peri-

collisions per particle. Moreover, inelastic collapse was prevented by switching to elastic collisions whenever two successive collisions involved the same pair in a very short period of time [31].
The appearance of clustering instabilities in simulations is usually identified by means of visual snapshots [9]. However, this might be difficult if N is not very large, as happens in a dilute gas. It is then very convenient to monitor the degree of spatial homogeneity of the gas by means of a single quantity that oversees the whole system. To this end, we propose here the (discrete and coarse-grained) KLD [17, 18] of the spatial distribution of particles in the box with respect to a reference homogeneous distribution as a control parameter to detect clustering inhomogeneities. Although the KLD is not actually a metric function, it somehow measures the distance (divergence) of a distribution with respect to a reference one as the amount of information lost when the reference model distribution is used to approximate the true distribution. The KLD has been used to mea-

To construct the coarse-grained KLD, the HD simulation box is split into M  1 square cells of side length Lcell and area L2cell. Let us denote by Ncell = 0, 1, . . . , N the number of disks inside a given cell. The fraction of cells having exactly Ncell particles will be denoted as p(Ncell); equivalently, this is the probability that a cell chosen at random has Ncell particles. Obviously, the average number of particles per cell is acell  Ncell = N/M = nL2cell. A relevant quantity is the variance c2ell = Nc2ell - a2cell, measuring fluctuations around the

where pref(Ncell) is a reference distribution modeling a spatially uniform system. Here we choose such a distri-

particles. If we randomly "shoot" a particle to the sim-
ulation box, the probability that it hits a given cell is M -1. Thus, in the reference model, the probability that
Ncell particles have hit the cell after N shootings is given by the binomial distribution

be indicators of spontaneous heterogeneities in the spatial particle distributions.
In most of our simulations, we have chosen the system identified with the label A in Table II. After an aging stage of s = 500 collisions per particle, the coarse-grained spatial distribution p(Ncell) was obtained by averaging the histograms corresponding to the population of the M cells from s = 500 to s = 1 000. The KLD was then evaluated from Eqs. (5.1) and (5.2). Figures 7(a) and 7(b) show the dependence of the computed KLD vs  (at fixed  = 0.2 and  = 0.7) and vs  (at fixed  = 0.25), respectively. The behavior of the theoretical eigenvalues  and  ,3 for k = 1.253 are shown in Figs. 7(c) and 7(d), respectively. We observe that the MD values of the KLD and the theoretical values of the eigenvalue  ,3 are rather correlated: in general, the larger  ,3 the larger D. The relevant point here is that theory predicts that the system becomes unstable if  = 0.2 in the interval -0.217 <  < 0.695 and if  = 0.25 for  < 0.466.

On the other hand, the MD data for D do not seem to experience a big increase in those cases, thus casting doubts about the true instability of perturbations with k = 1.253 if  = 0.2.
In order to clarify the situation, we have performed additional simulations for system B (see Table II), where the associated wave number is k = 0.886, and selected the coefficients of restitution  = 0.2 and  = 0.25. Figure 8 shows the temporal evolution of some relevant quantities for both systems (A and B). The considered quantities are (a) the rotational-to translational temperature ratio  = 3/t -2, (b) the excess translational velocity kurtosis a20  V 4 /2 V 2 2 - 1, (c) the excess angular velocity kurtosis a02  4 /3 2 2 - 1, (d) the translationalangular correlation cumulant a11  V 22 / V 2 2 -1, (e) the KLD D, and (f) the ratio 4D/(c2ell/acell - 1)2. In a first stage (lasting about 10 collisions per particle) we have observed that both systems evolve in an analogous way. However, as clearly seen from Fig. 8, their evolutions depart from each other in later stages. System B evolves to a state where (a) almost all the kinetic energy is concentrated on the translational degrees of freedom (  1), (b) the distribution of translational velocities is platykurtic (a20 < 0), (c) the distribution of angular velocities is much less leptokurtic (a02 > 0) than in system A, (d) the translational velocities are negatively correlated with the angular ones (a11 < 0), (e) the KLD takes values more than an order of magnitude higher (D  10-1) than in system A, and (f) the estimate (5.4) is much less accurate than in system A. Moreover, the simulation data in the case of system A agree very well with HCS theoretical estimates for , a20, a02, and a11 [24], in sharp contrast to system B.
Figure 8 is supplemented by Fig. 9, which presents snapshots (at s = 100) of systems A and B with  = 0.2 and  = 0.25. While system A does not present any visible signature of instability, system B exhibits clusters and vortices. Furthermore, the color code in Figs. 9(a) and 9(c) shows that disks in system B have typically less rotational energy than translational energy, in contrast to what happens in system A. The loss of rotational energy (relative to the translational one) in system B is stronger in the particles belonging to the clusters, which are also those participating in the vortices and moving with a higher translational velocity.
Therefore, from Figs. 8 and 9 we can conclude that a dilute HD gas with coefficients of restitution  = 0.2 and  = 0.25 is stable against perturbations of (reduced) wave number k = 1.253 (system A), while it is unstable against perturbations of (reduced) wave number k = 0.886 (system B). Thus, the true critical wave number kc for  = 0.2 and  = 0.25 must be 0.89 < kc < 1.25. In contrast, in our approximation we obtain k = 0.822 but k  . As a consequence, a more accurate theoretical treatment of very inelastic particles ( = 0.2) demands for the inclusion of velocity cumulants in the description.
Let us consider now the case of less inelastic parti-

11

cles, namely  = 0.7, but still with  = 0.25. In such a case, k = 0.721 and k = 0.626, so that the clustering instability is preempted by the vortex one and the theoretical critical wave number is kc = 0.721. Systems A (k = 1.253) and B (k = 0.886) are expected to be stable if (, ) = (0.7, 0.25), despite the fact that Figs. 8 and 9 showed the instability of system B at (, ) = (0.2, 0.25). To complement the picture, we have also considered the point (, ) = (0.7, 0.25) for a third system C (see Table II) for which k = 0.627; since k < kc, system C is expected to be unstable. The simulation results are displayed in Figs. 10 and 11, which confirm that systems A and B are stable, while system C is unstable. Note that in Fig. 10(f), due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the evolution curves of both D and (c2ell/acell - 1)2/4 in systems A and B, only the steady-state ratio 4D/(c2ell/acell - 1)2 is shown in the case of those systems.
Thus, according to our MD simulations, the true critical wave number for (, ) = (0.7, 0.25) lies in the interval 0.63 < kc < 0.89, in close agreement with the theoretical prediction kc = 0.721. Moreover, k < k and, as can be observed from Figs. 10 and 11, clustering is indeed present, which means that the theoretical prediction is pretty reliable for this moderately inelastic case.
VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this work, we have carried out a detailed linear stability analysis of the HCS of a dilute gas of inelastic and rough HD or HS within a common framework, thus extending previous HS results [10] to the case of HD gases. First, the NSF equations have been linearized around the HCS solution by a formally exact analysis. Next, the final results have been obtained by the introduction of the approximate expressions of the transport coefficients derived in the companion paper I [16], which are nonlinear functions of the coefficients of normal () and tangential () restitution, the reduced moment of inertia (), and the numbers of degrees of freedom (dt and dr).
As happens with rough HS [10] and the case of dt-dimensional smooth particles [5, 21, 22], there are two longitudinal (sound) modes that are always stable, whereas the third longitudinal (heat) and the (dt - 1)fold transverse (shear) modes become unstable for long enough wavelengths. The heat mode is associated with cluster instabilities, while the shear modes are related to vortex formation. This analysis has allowed us to determine the critical length Lc, such that systems with a size L > Lc are unstable under linear perturbations. The outcome highlights that, in general, two-dimensional HD systems become unstable for smaller reduced wavelengths than their three-dimensional HS counterparts. Additionally, the dual role of roughness, according to which small and large levels of roughness make the system less unstable than the frictionless system, previously observed in the HS geometry [9, 10], still holds in the HD case. Moreover, we have established that the region in the param-

eter space where cluster instabilities dominate against

vortices (i.e., k > k) is generally larger for HD than for HS.

The most surprising consequence of our analysis is the

appearance of a region of absolute instability, where the

critical longitudinal wave number diverges (k   or,

equivalently, Lc  0). The boundary of this region is defined by the condition  = µ, which, while residually

present in HS systems, is especially relevant in the HD

case (see Fig. 3). In fact, the HS region of absolute insta-

bility vanishes if  > 0.277 (what includes the case of a

uniform

mass

distribution,



=

2 5

)

but

it

always

emerges

in the HD case, regardless of the value of .

The absolute instability zone for HD is a very pecu-

liar prediction, and one must be wary of it. First of

all, we have established that this region materializes for

very inelastic systems (at least  < 0.426 if  = 0.302

and



<

0.392

if



=

1 2

).

Even for the smooth case,

one can face a similar issue in standard approximations

[5, 21], which disappears if a more consistent approach

is employed [22]. In addition, it is known for HS that

velocity cumulants in the HCS may play an important

role [26­28], its effect being even more noticeable for HD

[24]. Therefore, in order to study whether the absolute

instability phenomenon actually exists or is an artifact of

the performed approximations, we have performed event-

driven MD simulations which address this question.

In order to deal with the problem, small system sizes

must be tested in the simulations, which implies a small

number of particles in the dilute case. Because of that,

we have chosen not to rely only on a visual determination

of clustering or vortices via snapshots. This fact was the

clincher to use a coarse-grained KLD (with a binomial

distribution as the reference probability distribution) to

monitor the presence of spatial heterogeneities. More-

over, instead of analyzing deviations from Haff's cool-

ing law as indicators of instability [19, 36], we have fo-

cused on the temporal evolution of quantities (such as

the rotational-to-translational temperature ratio  and

velocity cumulants) that are unaffected by the velocity

scaling performed in our simulations.

Two-dimensional MD simulations of HD with a uni-

form

mass

distribution

(

=

1 2

)

were

established

under

three different setups (A, B, and C), as summarized in

Table II. The high-inelasticity point (, ) = (0.2, 0.25)

lies inside the theoretical region of absolute instability.

However, according to Figs. 8 and 9, although system

B (k  0.89) is indeed unstable, system A (k  1.25)

is not. Thus, the (reduced) critical wave number at

(, ) = (0.2, 0.25) does not diverge but is bounded as

0.89 < kc < 1.25; this critical value is anyway relatively high, as compared with HS values or with values

in other regions of the HD parameter space (see Figs. 4

and 5). The picture is complemented with the moderate-

inelasticity point (, ) = (0.7, 0.25), in which case sys-

tems A and B are stable, while system C (k  0.63)

is not (see Figs. 10 and 11). The determined range

0.63 < kc < 0.89 is now consistent with the theoretical

12

prediction kc = 0.721. It is worth noting that in the cases where our MD sim-
ulations indicated instability (system B in Fig. 8, system C in Fig. 10), the temperature ratio  reached small but nonzero stationary values after a certain number of collisions per particle. This implies a dramatic loss of rotational energy relative to the translational one, which is stronger in the particles involved in cluster and vortex formation. The fact that limt (t) = 0 in the unstable regime contrasts with results for moderately dense HD systems reported in Ref. [19], according to which (t)  t-0.6  0. A possible explanation is that the different cooling power laws observed in Ref. [19] may be present in a transient evolution stage, but for a sufficiently large number of collisions per particle both average energies reach a common decay and thus an asymptotic stationary value  = 0 is obtained.
While signaling a region of strong instability, the predicted high-inelasticity region of absolute instability seems to be a consequence of the neglect of HCS velocity cumulants in the derivation of the NSF transport coefficients carried out in paper I [16]. This calls for a more complex and consistent treatment which we plan to undertake in the near future [24]. We will also carry out a

similar work for stochastically driven granular gases, in which case the ansatz of a semi-Maxwellian form for the velocity distribution function of the base reference state is more accurate than in the free cooling situation.
To conclude, we hope this work may encourage further investigation on this topic, such as better approximations, more computer simulations by both MD and the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, and even experimental tests about the impact of roughness on the hydrodynamic properties and stability of HD and HS granular gases.
