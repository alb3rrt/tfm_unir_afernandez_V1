A note on extremal digraphs containing at most t walks of length k with the same endpoints
Zhenhua Lyu
Abstract
Let n, k, t be positive integers. What is the maximum number of arcs in a digraph on n vertices in which there are at most t distinct walks of length k with the same endpoints? In this paper, we prove that the maximum number is equal to n(n - 1)/2 and the extremal digraph are the transitive tournaments when k  n - 1  max{2t + 1, 2 2t + 9/4 + 1/2 + 3}. Based on this result, we may determine the maximum numbers and the extremal digraphs for k  max{2t + 1, 2 2t + 9/4 + 1/2 + 3} and n is sufficiently large, which generalises the existing results. A conjecture is also presented.

1 Introduction
We discuss only finite simple digraphs (without multiple arcs but allowing loops). The terminology and notation is that of [1], except as indicated. The number of the vertices of a digraph is its order and the number of the arcs its size. We abbreviate directed walks and directed cycles as walks and cycles, respectively. The length of a walk or cycle is its number of arcs. A p-cycle is a cycle of length p. Similarly, a p-walk is a walk of length p. Let D = (V, A) be a digraph with vertex set V and arc set A. The size of D is denoted by a(D). The outdegree and indegree of a vertex u, denoted by d+(u) and d-(u), is the number of arcs with tails and heads u, respectively. Denote by
N +(u) = {x  V|(u, x)  A} and N -(u) = {x  V|(x, u)  A}.

For a set X  V, we denote by D[X] the subgraph of D induced by X. For u, v  V, uv denotes the arc from u to v and the notation u  v means uv  A.
Tura´n type problems are among the most important topics in graph theory, which concern the possible largest number of edges in graphs forbidding given subgraphs and the extremal graphs achieving that maximum number of edges. The systematic investigation of digraph extremal problem was initiated by Brown and Harary [2]. For more details, see [3, 4]. Given a family of digraphs F , a digraph D is said to be F -free if D contains no subgraph from F . Let ex(n, F ) be the maximum size of F -free digraphs of order n and EX(n, F ) be the set of F -free digraphs of order n with size ex(n, F ). Given two positive integers k, t, denote by Fk,t the family of digraphs consisting of t different walks of length k with the same initial vertex and the same terminal vertex. In [5], the authors posed a Tura´n type problem as follows.
Problem 1. Given positive integers n, k, t, determine ex(n, Fk,t+1) and EX(n, Fk,t+1).
The initial version of Problem 1 was posed by Zhan at a seminar in 2007, which concerned the case t = 1, see [13, p. 234]. In the last decade, Problem 1 for the case t = 1 has been completely solved by Wu [12], by Huang and Zhan [8], by Huang, Lyu and Qiao [7], by Lyu [11], and by Huang and Lyu [6]. For the general cases of Problem 1, the case k = 2 has been studied in [9], and the case for k  n - 1  6t + 1 has been solved in [5].
Theorem 2 ([5]). Let t be a positive integer. For k  n - 1  6t + 1, a digraph D  EX(n, Fk,t+1) if and only if D is a transitive tournament.
We define z(t) as the smallest integer such that if k  n - 1  z(t), then D  EX(n, Fk,t+1) if and only if D is a transitive tournament. Huang and Zhan [8] proved that z(1) = 4. It follows from Theorem 2 that z(t) is well defined for each positive integer t and
z(t)  6t + 1.
Based on this fact, using induction on n, Lyu [10] obtained the following result.
Theorem 3. Let k, n, t be positive integers with k  6t + 1 and n  k + 5 + log2(t). Then D  EX(n, Fk,t+1) if and only if D is an balanced blow-up of the transitive tournament of order k.
Motivated by Theorem 3, [11, Theorem 2] and [7, Theorem 1], we present the conjecture as follows.
Conjecture 4. Let k  z(t) and let n be sufficiently large. Then D  EX(n, Fk,t+1) if and only if D is a balanced blow-up of the transitive tournament of order k.
From [8] we get z(1) = 4. Hence, Conjecture 4 holds confirmly when t = 1. In the point of this view, it is important to determine the exact value or a better upper bound of z(t) for each t. In this note, we present a new upper bound for z(t) as follows.

Theorem 5. let t be a positive integer. Then z(t)  max{2t + 1, 2 2t + 9/4 + 1/2 + 3}.

(1.1)

Adopting the same arguments as in the proofs in [10](modify a few details in the proof), we may obtain that Theorem 3 holds for k  max{2t + 1, 2 2t + 9/4 + 1/2 + 3}, which improves the main result of [10] when t  2.

2 Proof of Theorem 5

We need the following lemmas.
Lemma 6. Let n, t be positive integers and let D be a digraph of order n. If an m1-cycle C1 and an m2-cycle C2 in D are joint, then D is not Fk,t+1-free for all k  Llog2(t + 1), where L is the least common multiple of m1 and m2.

Proof. Let a1 = L/m1 and a2 = L/m2. Assume C1 and C2 are joint at vertex v. Let w be the walk of length Llog2(t + 1) from v to v along C1. We partition w into log2(t + 1) walks of the same length from v to v, say w1, . . . , wlog2(t+1). Each of {w1, . . . , wlog2(t+1)} could be replaced by repeating C2 a2 times. Therefore, there exist t + 1 distinct walks of length Llog2(t + 1) from v to v. For k > Llog2(t + 1), we can extend these walks along C2 to k-walks with the same endpoints.
Lemma 7 ([5]). Let n, t be positive integers and let D be a digraph of order n. If an m1cycle C1 and an m2-cycle C2 in D are connected by an arc, then D is not Fk,t+1-free for k  tL + 1.

The girth of a digraph with a cycle is the length of its shortest cycle, and a digraph with no cycle has infinite girth.
Lemma 8 ([5]). Let D be a loopless digraph of order n. If a(D) = n(n - 1)/2, then D is a transitive tournament or
g(D)  3.

Let D = (V, A) be a digraph with l loops. Denote by d(u) the number of arcs incident

with u. We have

d(u) =

d+(u) + d-(u) - 1, if u  u;

d+(u) + d-(u),

otherwise.

Since a(D) = d+(u) and a(D) = d-(u), we have

uV

uV

2a(D) = d(u) + l,
uV

(2.1)

and d(u) = a(D) - a(D[V \ {u}]) for all u  V.
Lemma 9. Let D = (V, A) is Fk,t+1-free with k  2log2(t + 1). Then d(u)  |V| for all u  V.

Proof. Suppose there exists u  V such that d(u)  |V| + 1. It follows that at least two cycles are joint at u. Moreover, these 2 cycles are either two 2-cycles or one loop and one 2-cycle. By Lemma 6, D is not Fk,t+1-free for k  2log2(t + 1), a contradiction.
Lemma 10. Let D = (V, A) be a digraph and let C and T be disjoint cycle and tournament in D, where |V(T )|  2 2t + 9/4 + 1/2 + 1. If there exists at least one arc between each vertex of C1 and each vertex of T , then D is not Fk,t+1-free for k  max{t+1, 3log2(t+1)}.

Proof. To the contrary, suppose D is Fk,t+1-free for k  max{t + 1, 3log2(t + 1)}. Suppose T contains a 3-cycle C1 as its subdigraph. Let

C  w1  · · ·  wl  w1 and C1  u1  u2  u3  u1.

Without loss of generality, we assume w1  u1. If u2  w1, we obtain a 3-cycle u2  w1  u1  u2. Since two 3-cycles are joint, by Lemma 6 we obtain D is not Fk,t+1-free,

a contradiction. Hence, w1  u2. Similarly, w1  u3. If there exists some i such that

ui  wl, we obtain ui  wl  w1  ui. Then two 3-cycles are joint. By Lemma 6, D is not

Fk,t+1-free, a contradiction. Hence wl  ui for i  {1, 2, 3}. Repeate the above arguments,

we have

wi  uj for i  {1, 2, . . . , l} and j  {1, 2, 3}.

(2.2)

We construct walks of length k from w1 to u1 in the following way. For each t1  {0, 1, . . . , t}, there are a walk of length t1 with its initial vertex w1 along C, say Wt1, and a walk of length k - t1 - 1 with terminal vertex u1 along C1, say Wt1. Since (2.2), Wt1Wt1 is a walk of length k with initial vertex w1 and terminal vertex u1. Then there exist t + 1 distinct walks of length k from w1 to u1, a contradiction. Hence T contains no 3-cycles. Combining
this with Lemma 8, T is acyclic, and hence it is transitive. Let a = 2t + 9/4 + 1/2 .
Since |V(T )|  2a+1, without loss of generality, we assume w1 has at least a+1 successors in T . Let those successors be {t0, t1, t2, . . . , ta} with ti  t0 for i = {1, 2, . . . , a}. For any pair i, j  {1, 2, . . . , a} with i < j, we have · · ·  w1  ti  tj  t0. Since a(a - 1)/2  t + 1, then there are more than t walks of length at least 3, a contradiction.

Now we are ready to give the proof of Theorem 5.

Proof of Theorem 5. Let a = 2 2t + 9/4 + 1/2 + 1 and let n  a + 2. It is easily seen

that the transitive tournament of order n is in EX(n, Fk,t+1). Hence,

ex(n, Fk,t+1)



n(n - 2

1)

(2.3)

4

First we prove that

ex(n, Fk,t+1)

=

n(n - 2

1) .

Suppose otherwise that D is Fk,t+1-free on n vertices with l loops and

(2.4)

a(D)



n(n - 2

1)

+ 1.

(2.5)

By the pigeonhole principle, there exists some v such that d(v)  n. Combining this with

Lemma 9, we have

d(v) = n.

(2.6)

We distinguish the following two cases.

Case 1. vv / A. Then there exists u  V \ {v} such that vu, uv  A. By Lemma 6, two
2-cycles can not be joint. Hence v is on exactly one 2-cycle. Combining this with (2.6), each
vertex in V \ {u, v} is jointed with v by exactly one arc. By Lemma 7, D - v has no 2-cycles or loops, which implies that d(w)  n - 1 for all w  V \ {v, u}. By Lemma 9 and (2.5), we obtain d(u) = n and
d(w) = n - 1 for all w  V \ {v, u}.

Hence, D[V \ {u, v}] is a tournament. Moreover, each vertex in V \ {u, v} is jointed with each of {u, v} by exactly one arc. Since |V \ {u, v}|  a, by Lemma 10, D is not Fk,t+1, a contradiction.

Case 2. vv  A. By Lemma 7, v is jointed by exactly one arc with each vertex in V. Moreover, each vertex in V \ {v} is not on a loop or a 2-cycle. It follows from (2.5) and (2.6) that D[V \ {v}] is a tournament. By Lemma 10, D is not Fk,t+1-free, a contradiction. Now we get (2.4).

Now we characterize the structures of the digraphs in EX(n, Fk,t+1). Let D  EX(n, Fk,t+1). First we show that D contains no loops. By (2.4), we obtain that

a(D)

=

n(n - 1) 2

and

a(D[V

\ {u}])



(n - 1)(n - 2)/2.

Combining this with the definition of d(u), we get d(u)  n - 1 for all u  V. Recalling (2.1), D is loopless. Moreover,

d(u) = n - 1 for all u  V.

(2.7)

Suppose D contains a 2-cycle u  v  u. By Lemma 6, v can not be on two distinct 2-cycles. Hence, it is joined with n - 2 distinct vertices. Let v0  V such that there is no arc between v and v0. From (2.7) v0 is on a 2-cycle, say v0  v1  v0. Obviously, v1 is joined with v. By Lemma 7, D is not Fk,t+1-free, a contradiction. Hence, D contains no 2-cycles. Recalling (2.7), D is a tournament.

5

Suppose D contains a 3-cycle u  v  w  u. Note that D[V \ {u, v, w}] is also a tournament. Since n - 3  a, by Lemma 10, D is not Fk,t+1-free, a contradiction. It follows from Lemma 8 that D is a transitive tournament.
Conversely, it is easily seen that the transitive tournament of order n is in EX(n, Fk,t+1). This completes the proof.
