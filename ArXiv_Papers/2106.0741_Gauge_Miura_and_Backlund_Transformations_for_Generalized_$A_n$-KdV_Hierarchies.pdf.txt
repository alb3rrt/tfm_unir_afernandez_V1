Abstract
The construction of Miura and B¨acklund transformations for An mKdV and KdV hierarchies are presented in terms of gauge transformations acting upon the zero curvature representation. As in the well known sl(2) case, we derive and relate the equations of motion for the two hierarchies. Moreover, the Miura-gauge transformation is not unique, instead, it is shown to be connected to a set of generators labeled by the exponents of An The construction of generalized gauge-Ba¨cklund transformation for the An-KdV hierarchy is obtained as a composition of Miura and B¨acklund-gauge transformations for An-mKdV hierarchy. The zero curvature representation provide a framework which is universal within all flows and generate systematically B¨acklund transformations for the entirely hierarchy.

1 Introduction

The recent studies of integrable models has revealed an increasing importance of its underlying algebraic structure which is intimetely connected to a series of peculiar properties, as to the existence of an infinite number of conservation laws, soliton solutions, B¨acklund transformation, etc. Structural connection has been known for some time, see for instance, [1], [2]. Many of these properties can be derived from the zero curvature formulation in terms of two dimensional gauge potentials, Ax and At lying in an affine algebra, G^, i.e.,

xAt - tAx + [Ax, At] = 0.

(1.1)

A particular virtue of the zero curvature representation (1.1) is its gauge invariance. Conservation laws can be derived by abelianizing the two dimensional potentials by gauge transforming them into

the Cartan subalgebra of G^ [3]. Soliton solutions in turn, can be constructed by gauge transforming a vacuum solution Avxac and Avt ac into some nontrivial configuration (dressing) see for instance [4]. More recently, gauge transformation was shown to be a key ingredient in constructing B¨acklund transformations [5]-[8]. In all cases, gauge transformation is an essential ingredient.
B¨acklund transformation interpolates between two soliton solutions of an integrable model [9]. More recently, it was employed to describe integrable defects in the sense that two field configurations can be connected by a defect at certain space location [10]-[11]. Thus, the classification of integrable defects and the construction of the various types of B¨acklund transformations are intimetely connected. The construction of B¨acklund transformations can be formulated in terms of gauge transforming the two dimensional potentials Aµ from one field configuration, say  to another, , i.e.,

U (i, i)Aµ(i) = Aµ(i)U (i, i) + µU (i, i)

(1.2)

A natural construction of B¨acklund-gauge transformations U (i, i) in terms of a graded affine algebra was proposed in [6], [7] for the A2 mKdV (sinh-Gordon) and in [8] for the generalized An Toda Hierarchies. Moreover U (i, i) was shown to be an universal object and provide a systematic construction of B¨acklund transformation extended to all evolution equations (flows) within the hierarchy.
Another application of gauge invariance of the zero curvature formulation is the construction of a Miura transformation connecting the mKdV and KdV hierarchies. Several aspects of KdV hierarchies have been developed in the past with regards to spherically symmetric reductions of self dual Yang-Mills theories in 4-D, the realization of W -algebras, etc (e.g. see for instance [12]-[16] and refs. therein). In particular, in ref. [7] a Miura-gauge transformation S was proposed to map the the A2 two dimensional potentials Amµ KdV into AKµ dV , i.e.,

AKµ dV = SAmµ KdV S-1 + SµS-1

(1.3)

In this paper we follow the same line of reasoning of ref. [7] to discuss the construction of Miura-gauge transformation from the An-mKdV to the An-KdV systems. In particular it allows us to derive the B¨acklund-gauge transformation of the An-KdV from the An-mKdV system.
This paper is organized as follows. In sections 2 and 3 we discuss the algebraic structure and construct the general An equations of motion for the second flow of zero curvature representation for both mKdV and KdV systems. In section 4 we discuss the structure of the Miura-gauge transformation for A2, A3 systems (and for A4 in the appendix B). In particular, we argue that there are more than one Miura transformation connecting both systems. In fact, for An there are n + 1 transformations labeled by the identity I and by the discrete set of constant generators E(k)  K^, of grade k = 1, . . . , n. We construct explicitly the Miura transformations for A2, A3 and A4 and propose a general construction for the An case. Section 5 contains the general structure between equations of motion of the two integrable hierarchies. In section 6 we present the construction of B¨acklund transformation for the An-KdV system as a combination of Miura and B¨acklund transformations for the mKdV system. Section 7 contains our conclusions.

2 mKdV Equations
Here we shall consider generic time evolution equations for the An-mKdV hierarchy which are classified according to the grading structure developed in the Appendix A. Consider the decomposition of an affine Lie algebra G^ = a Ga according to a grading operator Q such that [Q, Ga] = aGa.
2

Let E  E(1) be a constant grade one generator responsible for a second decomposition of G^ into Kernel of E, K^ = {x  K^, [x, E] = 0} and its complement, M^ i.e.,

G^ = K^  M^ .

(2.1)

In particular, projecting into the zero grade subspace, G0 = K  M. Define now the Lax operator as

L = x + E + A0,

(2.2)

where A0  M (and consequently A0  G0). In the case of G^ = s^l(n + 1) and principal gradation with subspaces given as in (A.5), E(1) is given by

n

E  E(1) =

Ek + E-(1+···+n) .

k=1

(2.3)

and A0 parametrized as

(2.4)

where ri = vi - vi-1, i = 1, . . ., n + 1, v0 = vn+1 = 0. The relation vi =

i j

=1

rj

follows

from

trace condition.

We now propose the construction of time evolution equations in the zero curvature representa-

tion,

[x + Ax, tN + AtN ] = xAtN - tN Ax + [Ax, AtN ] = 0

(2.5)

where Ax = E(1) + A0. The so called positive grade time evolution is constructed for AtN given by

AtN = D(N) + D(N-1)+ · · · + D(0),

D(j)  Gj , N  Z+.

(2.6)

The zero curvature representation (2.5) decomposes according to the graded structure into

[E(1), D(N)] = 0, [E(1), D(N-1)] + [A0, D(N)] + xD(N) = 0,
... [A0, D(0)] + xD(0) - tN A0 = 0,

(2.7) (2.8)
(2.9)

and allows solving for D(j) recursively starting from the highest grade eqn. (2.7). In particular,
the last eqn. (2.9) is the only eqn. involving time derivatives acting on A0 and can be regarded as the time evolution for the fields parametrizing A0  M.
Solving (2.7) for N = 2 and n > 1, according to the grading structure given in (A.5) we find

D(2) = a2

n-1
Ek+k+1 + E-(1+···+n-1) + E-(2+···+n)
k=1

 K^ .

(2.10)

where a2 is an arbitrary coefficient. The lower grade matrices D(i), i = 0, 1 can be solved recursively
from the appropriate grade projections of the zero-curvature equation (2.5.) For example when N = 2, the grade one element D(1) is solved from (2.8) i.e.,

[E(1), D(1)] + [A0, D(2)] + xD(2) = 0 .

(2.11)

leading to

n

xa2 = 0

and

D(1) = (vk+1 - vk-1) Ek + (v1 - vn)E-(1+···+n)

k=1

where we shall set a2 = 1. The grade 1 projection of the zero-curvature equation(2.5) leads to

(2.12)

with D(0) =

[E(1), D(0)] + [A0, D(1)] + xD(1) = 0,

Solving (2.14) for da, a = 1, . . . , n and inserting it into the grade 0 projection of the zero-

curvature equation (2.9) yields the eqn. of motion for t  t2,

tva = xda .

(2.15)

After multiplying both sides of relation (2.15) by the Cartan matrix K and making use of relation (2.14) we obtain, [19]

n
t Kbava = t (2vb - vb+1 - vb-1)
a=1
= x x(vb+1 - vb-1) + (2vb - vb+1 - vb-1)(vb+1 - vb-1) , b = 1, . . ., n .

(2.16)

Recalling equation (2.16) can be rewritten as,

t (rb+1 - rb) = -x x(rb + rb+1) - (rb+1 - rb) (rb + rb+1) , b = 1, . . ., n ,

(2.17)

that defines t2 flows of sl(n + 1) mKdV hierarchy. Inverting the Cartan matrix explicitly for the cases where n = 2, 3 in (2.16) we find in terms of vj variables, respectively,

3 KdV Equations

For the An-KdV hierarchy we shall employ the same algebraic structure namely, principal gradation, Qppal and constant grade one element, E(1) (2.3) and propose the following Lax operator

L = x + E(1) + A(-1) + · · · + A(-n), for k = 1, . . . , n, or in matrix form

A(k-n-1) = Jn+1-kE-(k+···+n)  M^  Gk-n-1 (3.1)

(3.2)

The zero curvature representation

[x + E(1) + A(-1) + · · · + A(-n), t2 + D(2) + D(1) + · · · + D(-n)] = 0

(3.3)

leads to the following graded eqns.,

[E(1), D(2)] = 0, [E(1), D(1)] + xD(2) = 0, [E(1), D(0)] + [A(-1), D(2)] + xD(1) = 0, [E(1), D(-1)] + [A(-1), D(1)] + [A(-2), D(2)] + xD(0) = 0,

(3.4) (3.5) (3.6) (3.7)

which involves the unknowns D(2), D(1), D(0) and DM (-1). Moreover, the lower graded eqns.,

[A(-1), D(-n)] + [A(-2), D(-n+1)] + · · · + [A(-n), D(-1)] = 0, [A(-2), D(-n)] + [A(-3), D(-n+1)] + · · · + [A(-n), D(-2)] = 0,
... [A(-n), D(-n+1)] + [A(-n+1), D(-n)] = 0,
[A(-n), D(-n)] = 0.

(3.8) (3.9)
(3.10) (3.11)

involves the unknowns DK(-1), · · · , D(-n). Together they lead to the time evolution eqns.

t2 A(-1) = [E(1), D(-2)] + [A(-1), D(0)] + [A(-2), D(1)] + [A(-3), D(2)] + xD(-1), (3.12)

t2 A(-2) = [E(1), D(-3)] + [A(-1), D(-1)] + · · · + [A(-4), D(2)] + xD(-2),

(3.13)

...

t2 A(-n) = [A(-1), D(-n+1)] + [A(-2), D(-n+2)] + · · · + [A(-n), D(0)] + xD(-n). (3.14)

In order to obtain the time evolution eqns. (3.12)-(3.14) we need to solve eqns. (3.4)-(3.7) for D(2), D(1), D(0), DM (-1) and (3.8)-(3.11) for DK(-1), D(-2), · · · , D(-n) . Let us start from (3.4) which coincides with (2.7) for N = 2 and yields D(2) = DK(2)  K given by (2.10).

5

Notice that since 5 [E(1), D(1)]  M, eqn. (3.5) imply that x(a2) = 0, DM (1) = 0 and henceforth D(1) = DK(1)  K^, i.e.,

D(1) = a1 E(01) + E(02) + · · · + E(0n) + E-(1()1+···+n)

(3.15)

Eqn (3.6) imply that

xa1 = 0,

[E(1), DM (0)] + [A(-1), DK(2)] = 0

and we shall take a1 = 0 and a2 = 1. Inserting A(-1) = J1 E-(0)n and D(0) = find

(3.19)

In order to solve eqns. (3.8)-(3.11) we propose a general solution for D(-i), i = 1, . . . , n by assigning to them only negative step operators (lower diagonal) of grade -i as follows,

D(-n) = b(1-n)E-(0()1+···+n),
D(-n+1) = b(1-n+1)E-(0()1+···+n-1) + b(2-n+1)E-(0()2+···+n), ...
D(-1) = b(1-1)E-(0)1 + b(2-1)E-(0)2 , + · · · + b(n-1)E-(0)n

(3.20)

where b(k-i) are coefficients to be determined by eqns. (3.12)-(3.14). In order to illustrate our formulation consider the following explicit examples,
5In general the subspaces defined by E is such that
[K, K]  K, [K, M]  M,
and each of the above eqns. gives rise to K and M components.

4 Miura Transformation

In this section we propose a Miura-gauge transformation S to connect the two gauge potentials Amx KdV and AKx dV as,

AKx dV = SAmx KdV S-1 + SxS-1

(4.1)

where

i=1

AKx dV = E(1) +

Jn+1-i E-(i +i+1 +···+n ) .

(4.2)

7

The first thing to notice is that both potentials in (4.2) are defined according to the same Lie algebraic structure, i.e., principal gradation, Qppal and share the same constant, grade one semisimple element E(1) given in (2.3) (see app. A). The desired Miura-gauge transformation S is then
constructed to preserves such structure. Let us recall the sl(2) case where the Miura transformation J = xv - v2,  = ±1 connects
the KdV and mKdV equations, i.e.,

4tJ - x3J - 6J xJ = P 4tv - x(x2v - 2v3) = 0,

P = (x - 2v)

(4.3)

In fact, in ref. [7] we have constructed two solutions for the Miura-gauge transformation (4.1), namely,

S=1 = I + s(-1) =

1 v

0 1

S=-1 = E(-1) + s(-2) =

0 1

-1 --1v

(4.4)

where s(-i)  G-i and E(-1) = E-1 + -1E1 =

0 -1 10

corresponding to  = +1 and  = -1

respectively.

Likewise the sl(2) case (4.4), we now consider G = sl(3) where E  E(1) = E1 + E2 + 0 1 0

E-1-2 = 0 0 1, and propose 3 solutions for S satisfying (4.1), 00

(4.10)

In the appendix B we develop the example for G = sl(4) by constructing 4 solutions for the Miura-gauge transformation (4.1) and notice a general pattern emerging that induces to the following general proposition for the sl(n + 1) case,

· Each solution generates a Miura transformation Ja(i), a = 1, . . . , n + 1.

5 Equations of Motion

We now conjecture that the equations of motion of the two hierarchies are connected as in the well
known case of the A2 KdV and mKdV equations (4.3). In fact, we argue that the equations of motion of the generalized An mKdV and KdV hierarchies are related by a matrix operator P, as [KdV (Ji)] = P [mKdv(vi)], or in componentes,

tJ1 

 tv1 

tJ2 

 tv2 

  

...

=P  

...

  

tJn

t2 vn

(5.1)

where the matrix operator P is denoted P = (Pij). Explicitly we have considered the equations of motion (2.18) and (3.24) for sl(3) written in the
form (5.1) as

tJ1 tJ2

=P

tv1 tv2

(5.2)

It is clear that there is a different P operator associated to each solution of the Miura-Gauge transformation (4.1).

· For S1 (4.5) and Miura (4.6),

P1(11) = -x + 2v1 - v2,

P1(21) = -x - v1 + 2v2,

P2(11) = x2 - 2v1x - 2xv1 + xv2 + 2v1v2-v22,

P2(21) = v1x - 2v1v2 + v12.

(5.3)

6It is clear that S contains a highest grade component commuting with E(1) in order to preserve the common graded structure the two gauge potentials AK x dV and Am x KdV .

9

· Likewise for the Miura-gauge transformation S2 (4.7) and Miura (4.8),
P1(12) = -x + 2v1 - v2, P1(22) = 2x - v1 + 2v2, P2(12) = -v2x + 2v1v2 - v22, P2(22) = -x2-v2x - xv1 - xv2 - 2v1v2 + v12.

(5.4)

· For S3 given in (4.9) and Miura (4.10),
P1(13) = 2x + 2v1 - v2, P1(23) = -x - v1 + 2v2, P2(13) = -x2 - v1x+v2x - xv1 + 2xv2 + 2v1v2 - v22, P2(23) = x2 + 2v1x - 2v2x+xv1 - 2xv2 + v12 - 2v1v2.

(5.5)

For the sl(4) case the same procedure can be employed for each associated Miura-gauge transformation given in appendix B.

6 B¨acklund Transformation

In this section we generalize the results of ref. [7] by constructing the B¨acklund transformation for the An-KdV hierarchy from the Miura and B¨acklund-gauge transformations constructed for the An-mKdV hierarchy. Consider the B¨acklund-gauge transformation for the An-mkdV hierarchy propossed in [8],

U (i, i)Amµ KdV (i) = Amµ KdV (i)U (i, i) + µU (i, i)

(6.1)

where ui = xi, vi = xi. Also, the Miura-gauge transformation can be written as,

AKµ dV (Ji) = SAmµ KdV (vi)S-1 + SµS-1.

(6.2)

Let K(I, J) be the generator of the B¨acklund-gauge transformation for the An-KdV hierarchy,

i.e.,

K(Ii, Ji)AKµ dV (Ii) = AKµ dV (Ji)K(Ii, Ji) + µK(Ii, Ji)

(6.3)

Inserting (6.2) into (6.1) , we find

K(Ii, Ji) = S(vi)U (i, i)S-1(ui)

(6.4)

Notice that K(Ii, Ji) given in (6.4) depend upon mKdV variables ui and vi. In ref. [7] we have shown that the gauge-B¨acklund transformation K(Ii, Ji) was entirely written in terms of KdV variables I and J if we use two different Miura gauge transformtions, for the right S(u) = S+ and for the left S(v)-1 = S--1 multiplications (see (4.4)). Here we will follow the same principle by choosing different S solutions for right and left multiplication in (6.4).
B¨acklund transformation for the An Toda theory was first proposed in [17] and in [8], it was generalized as a gauge transformation constructed and classified according to a graded affine Lie

10

algebraic structure . Such construction was shown to be universal within the hierarchy, i.e., in the sense that it is same for all positive and negative flows 7.
Consider the type I B¨acklund-gauge transformation for sl(3) mKdV hierarchy (see for instance
[8]),

1 U (i, i) = e1+1-2

(6.5)

which yield the following equations corresponding to the mKdV B¨acklund transformation,

u1 - v1 =  e1+1-2 - e-2-1 ,

u2 - v2 =  e-1+2+2 - e-2-1

(6.6)

where ui = xi, vi = xi, i = 1, 2 and take the two solutions S1(ui) and S3(vi) given by (4.5) and (4.9) to be inserted as right and left multiplications in (6.4) yielding the following matrix elements,

K11 = (-u1 + e1+1-2 )-1 K22 = (-u2 - v1 + v2 + e-1+2+2 )-1 K33 = (-v1 + e-2-1)-1 K12 = K23 = -1 K31 = 1 + Y -1

K13 = 0 K21 = xu1 - u21 + u1u2 - u1e-1+2+2 - (v1 - v2)(-u1 + e1+1-2 ) -1 K32 = xv1 - xv2 + v12 + v22 - 2v1v2 + u2v1 - u2e-2-1 - v1e-1+2+2 -1

(6.15)

We now show how to re-write the B¨acklund matrix K(Ii, Ji) in KdV variables. Subtracting the diagonal terms and using (6.6),

K11 - K22 = -u1 + v1 + u2 - v2 + e1+1-2 - e-1+2+2 -1 = 0

(6.16)

K22 - K33 = -u2 + v2 + e-1+2+2 - e-2-1 -1 = 0

Acting with x derivative on Q and re-arranging terms,

(6.18)

xQ = x(K11 + K22 + K33) = x(-u1 - u2 - 2v1 + v2) + u1(e-1+1-2 - e-1+2+2 ) + u2(e-1+2+2 - e-2-1 ) + v1(e1+1-2 - e-2-1 ) + v2(e-1+2+2 - e1+1-2 ).
7Observe that the relativistic Toda model correspond to the first negative flow [18]

11

After eliminating the exponentials from the mKdV B¨acklund transformations (6.6) and subsequent use of Miura transformations (4.6) and (4.10), i.e.,

I1(ui) = J1(1)(ui) = -xu1 - xu2 + u21 + u22 - u1u2 J1(vi) = J1(3)(vi) = 2xv1 - xv2 + v12 + v22 - v1v2

(6.19) (6.20)

we find,

xQ = I1 - J1.

(6.21)

The K21 matrix element also can be written interely in terms of KdV variables, e.g., replacing the xu1 term using (6.7),

where we have used (6.6). Likewise, using the Miura transformation (6.20) in (6.14) and then replacing the remaining xv1 using (6.9) we find,

We have verified that the very same argument follows if we instead of the pair S3(vi) and

S1-1(ui), use in (6.4) S1(vi) and S2-1(ui). The resulting B¨acklund-gauge transformation K for the

KdV hierarchy has the same form as (6.23) but now written in terms of the corresponding Miura

fields given in (4.6) and (4.8) and so is the resulting B¨acklund-gauge generator for the remaining

pair S2, S3.

Let us now write down explicit B¨acklund transformation for the A2-mKdV system. Employing the gauge-B¨acklund transformation (6.23) in (6.3) where gauge potentials AKµ dV are given by,

Subtracting (6.28) - (6.29) and (6.29) - (6.30) we eliminate tQ and recover (6.27) and (6.26) respectively. Moreover, substituting (6.25) in (6.29) we find

tQ = x(I1 - J1) + 2(I2 - J2),

(6.34)

which leads directly to the eqns. of motion (3.23) for I1 and J1 by acting with x in (6.34), i.e.,

t(I1 - J1) = x2(I1 - J1) + 2x(I2 - J2).

7 Discussion and Further Developments
The gauge invariance of zero curvature representation was exploited in order to map the An-mKdV hierarchy into its counterpart, the An-KdV hierarchy. Such map is known as generalized Miuragauge transformation and is generated by a gauge transformation denoted by S. We have shown by developing explicit examples, that S has the virtue of preserving the algebraic structure of the Lax operators (i.e., two dimensional gauge potentials Amµ KdV and AKµ dV ). An interesting discovery is that S is not unique, as it was already been sugested from the well known sl(2) example (4.3) in which the Miura transformation is two-fold degenerated, parametrized by  = ±1. The AnMiura-gauge transformation present a n + 1 degeneracy and was shown to be classified according to the elements of the Kernel of E(1), K^, supplemented with the identity element I. The role of the subgroup of transformations generated by such subset of generators is still not entirely clear and is currently under investigation.
The B¨acklund transformation for the KdV hierarchy, in turn was inherited from the gauge-B¨acklund transformation for the mKdV hierarchy by left-right multiplication by Miura-gauge generators as in (6.4), i.e., K(J, I) = S(I)U (, )S-1(J).
A surprising feature of the construction, is a nontrivial change of mKdV to KdV variables (, )  (J, I) which was shown to be possible if the left and right Miura transformations appearing in (6.4) correspond to different degenerate solutions associated to K^. Such fact was already realised for the sl(2) case in [7] and was explicitly verified for several combinations of Miura solutions for sl(3) example.
As a matter of fact, the resulting gauge B¨acklund transformation was entirely written in terms of KdV variables and appears as an universal object within the hierarchy, in the sense that it is the same for all flows. As a byproduct, it generates, in a systematic manner, the B¨acklund transformation for all flows. Moreover, this method provides a classification of integrable defects as proposed in [11] and may also be extended to other generalized type II B¨acklund transformations from mKdV to KdV hierarchies [8]. The framework employed in this paper may be also extended to Lie algebras other than An, whose Dynkin diagram may connect more than two nearest neighbours, e.g., B4, E6, E7, E8 in the line of ref. [20] or to non-simply laced algebras. Application to twisted algebras may also provide interesting examples in the lines of ref. [21].

A Affine Algebraic Structure

Consider an affine Kac-Moody algebra G^ defined by

[Hi(m), Hj(n)] = mm+n,0i,j

[Hi(m), E(n)] = iE(m+n)

[E(m), E(n)]

=

Let Q be a grading operator and consider a decomposition of the affine algebra G^ into grades subspaces, Ga such that,

G^ = Ga,
aZ

[Q, Ga] = a Ga,

[Ga, Gb]  Ga+b

(A.1)

In this paper we shall discuss G^ = s^l(n + 1) endowed with the principal gradation in which

n
Qppal = (n + 1)d + µa · h
a=1
where d is the derivation operator, i.e.,

(A.2)

[d, Ti(m)] = mTi(m),

Ti(m) = hi(m) or E(m)

(A.3)

and

[µa · h(m), E] = (µa · )E.

(A.4)

Here µa and a are the fundamental weights and simple roots respectively, µa · b = a,b, a, b = 1, · · · , n, and have normalized all roots of s^l(n + 1) such that 2 = 2. The operator Q in (A.2)
induces the following graded subspaces,

Gm(n+1) = {h1(m), · · · , hn(m)}, Gm(n+1)+1 = {E(m1 ), · · · , E(mn ), E-(m+1-1)···-n }, Gm(n+1)+2 = {E(m1+) 2 , E(m2+) 3 , · · · , E(mn-) 1+n , E-(m+1-1)···-n-1 , E-(m+2-1)···-n },
... Gm(n+1)+n = {E-(m+1 1), · · · , E-(m+n 1), E(m1+) ···+n }.

(A.5)

where hi(m) = i · H(m). Let K^ denote the Kernel of E composed by all elements within each subspace of grade q
commuting with E 8. In particular denote them by E(-q)  K^, q = 1, · · · n mod (n + 1), (see appendix of ref. [3]) e.g.,

n

E(-n) =

E(-k 1) + E-(0()1+···+n),

k=1

n-1

E(-n+1) =

E(-k+1)k+1 + E-(0()1+···+n-1) + E-(0()2+···+n),

k=1

...

n

E(-1) =

E-(0)k + E-(-(1)1+···+n)

k=1

(A.6)

8In fact there are precisely n generators commuting with E of grade given by the exponents modulo the Coxeter

number h which in the An case are q = 1, · · · , n modulo n + 1
