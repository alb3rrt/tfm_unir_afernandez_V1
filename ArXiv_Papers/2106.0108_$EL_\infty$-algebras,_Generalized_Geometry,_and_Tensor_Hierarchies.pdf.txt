Abstract We define a generalized form of L8-algebras called EL8-algebras. As we show, these provide the natural algebraic framework for generalized geometry and the symmetries of double field theory as well as the gauge algebras arising in the tensor hierarchies of gauged supergravity. Our perspective shows that the kinematical data of the tensor hierarchy is an adjusted higher gauge theory, which is important for developing finite gauge transformations as well as nonlocal descriptions. Mathematically, EL8-algebras provide small resolutions of the operad Lie, and they shed some light on Loday's problem of integrating Leibniz algebras.

1. Introduction and results
In this paper, we define a new kind of homotopy algebras called EL8-algebras, which can be regarded as a weaker yet quasi-isomorphic form of L8-algebras. Our construction vastly generalizes previous work on weaker forms of categorified Lie algebras [1, 2, 3], from where we also borrowed the nomenclature.

1.1. Five questions
Our "everything homotopy" Lie algebras appear naturally in many contexts, and there are five questions that they can answer or, at least, suggest an answer to.

What is the algebraic structure underlying adjusted higher curvatures?
Higher gauge theories, i.e. gauge theories of higher form potentials corresponding to connections on higher or categorified principal bundles, may underlie a future non-abelian M5-brane model [4, 5], but they certainly arise in heterotic supergravity as well as the tensor hierarchies of gauged supergravities, see e.g. [6, 7] for reviews, and of double and exceptional field theories [8]. A proper understanding of the relevant mathematical structures is evidently important: global constructions are only possible with the correct notion of corresponding higher principal bundles.
However, already the appropriate definition of the notion of curvature in a higher gauge theory is not straightforward for non-flat theories. Using categorification, there is a straightforward definition of higher curvature forms, which was also found in the first mathematical papers on non-abelian gerbes, [9] and [10]. Unfortunately, these curvatures are too restrictive for non-flat connections, cf. [11]. A consistency condition known as fake flatness needs to be imposed for the full cocycle data of non-abelian gerbes to glue together consistently (and for gauge or BRST transformations to close). This condition requires all curvature components except for the one of highest form degree to vanish, which in turn implies that all of the components of the gauge potentials except for the one of highest form degree can locally be gauged away. This is readily seen in the strict case [11]; see also [12] for a detailed analytical proof.
In fact, physicists have known for quite some time that coupling abelian 2-form potentials to non-abelian 1-form potentials is best done using a different expression for the 3-form component of the curvature [13, 14]. This modification consists of adding terms proportional to curvature expressions to the flat curvature, which were not visible to the homotopy Maurer­Cartan theory. These necessary modifications were implemented for the string and five-brane structures in [15, 16] by performing a coordinate change on the Weil

2

algebra of the gauge L8-algebra1, which induces the necessary change in the definition of curvatures. Considering the curvatures arising in the tensor hierarchy, one encounters similar modifications.
The modifications required for the definitions of non-flat higher curvatures and which lead to a closed BRST complex were dubbed adjustments in [11], and a consistent higher parallel transport for adjusted higher curvatures was defined in [17]. An adjustment now requires additional higher products, which are not visible in the original higher gauge algebra. It turns out that they are components of higher products in EL8-algebras that are quasi-isomorphic to the higher gauge algebra.
In particular, we show in theorem 6.2 that there is a particular class of L8-algebras that come with a natural adjustment encoded in an EL8-algebra. This class is precisely the one arising in the tensor hierarchies of gauged supergravity. The latter are thus adjusted higher gauge algebras, employing EL8-algebras in their construction.
What is the full algebra underlying generalized geometry?
Generalized geometry in its simplest form is described by an exact Courant algebroid, which captures the infinitesimal gauge symmetries of Einstein­Hilbert gravity coupled to a Kalb­Ramond 2-form potential. Roytenberg has shown that the Courant algebroid is best regarded as a symplectic Lie 2-algebroid [18], and more general forms of the generalized tangent bundle can similarly be encoded in higher symplectic Lie algebroids. Dually, they are described by their Chevalley­Eilenberg algebras, which are certain differential graded Poisson algebras. The latter, in turn, give rise to associated L8-algebras via a derived bracket construction [19, 20], describing generalizations of the above mentioned gauge symmetries. In particular, the binary product of the L8-algebra for the Courant algebroid is simply the Courant bracket. This picture has extensions to double field theory, cf. [21].
It is somewhat unsatisfying that the derived bracket construction only reproduces the Courant bracket, while the Dorfman bracket, which antisymmetrizes to the Courant bracket, has to be constructed "by hand". It turns out that the derived bracket construction has a refinement, in which the differential graded Poisson algebra first gives rise to an EL8-algebra, which can then be antisymmetrized to the L8-algebra obtained in [20]. This construction of an EL8-algebra from a differential graded Lie algebra also underlies the gauge algebras appearing in the tensor hierarchies of gauged supergravity. As mentioned above, the refinement provides here the additional structure constants required for an adjustment.
What is the higher Poisson algebra arising in multisymplectic geometry?
Multisymplectic forms are higher, non-degenerate differential forms generalizing symplectic forms. Just as symplectic forms define a Poisson algebra structure on the algebra of functions, multisymplectic forms define higher analogues of Poisson algebras involving functions
1At the purely algebraic level, this ensures that one can define invariant polynomials in a way that is compatible with quasi-isomorphisms of L8-algebras, see also [11].

and differential forms [22]. As known since the work of Rogers [23, 24], these L8-algebras can be embedded into the above mentioned L8-algebras arising in the case of higher symplectic Lie-algebroids, and so it is not surprising that we again have a refinement which constructs an EL8-algebra from the multisymplectic form. For multisymplectic 3-forms, this had already been observed in [22]. With a general definition of EL8-algebras, we can now generalize the statement to arbitrary multisymplectic manifolds.
What is a small cofibrant replacement for Lie?
Given a field K, there exists a model category structure on the category of operads2 in the category of chain complexes (differential graded operads)3 over K [26, 25, 27], and in this context one wants to construct a cofibrant replacement O8 for a symmetric differential graded operad O over K. Two such constructions are known. First, there is always an S-cofibrant resolution for any operad (i.e. it need not be S-cofibrant), obtained via the tensor product with the algebraic Barratt­Eccles operad [28] or, equivalently, through the higher cobar­bar adjunction of [29], but the result is generally "larger" than necessary or expected. Second, one can use classical Koszul duality to construct a candidate O8, but this only works if the operad O is S-cofibrant, which means that Opnq is a projective KrSnsmodule for every n, cf. [30, Appendix B.6]. If K is of characteristic zero, then by Maschke's theorem every operad is automatically S-cofibrant. This is not the case if K is of positive characteristic. If, however, the operations in O do not have any permutation symmetry of their arguments, then the Sn action on Opnq is straightforward, and the operad is again automatically S-cofibrant.
For example, the operad A8 is a cofibrant replacement for Ass over any field, since its operations lack any symmetry. However, C8 and L8, containing symmetrizations and antisymmetrizations, are cofibrant replacements for Com and Lie, respectively, only when K is of characteristic zero.
Dehling [3], see also [31], raised the question of finding a small cofibrant replacement for Lie over arbitrary characteristic. Recall that Lie is not S-cofibrant when K is not of characteristic 0, and the Koszul duality strategy for a small resolution does not go through. Instead, an ad hoc degree-by-degree S-free resolution over Z of Lie¡ was constructed to low degrees in [3]. This partial resolution provides a definition of weak Lie 3-algebras and, equivalently, 3-term EL8-algebras.
Lacking any symmetry, the operad hLie we construct below is automatically S-cofibrant. Together with the strictification corollary 3.18, which states that any EL8-algebra, and thus any hLie-algebra, is quasi-isomorphic to a differential graded Lie algebra, it follows that hLie8 " EL8 is a cofibrant replacement for Lie, answering Dehling's question.
2All our operads will be symmetric and differential graded. 3There are complications for positive characteristic; see [25].

What is the object integrating Leibniz algebras?
In [32], Loday posed the "coquecigrue problem" of generalizing Lie's third theorem to Leibniz algebras. A conventional answer to this problem is given in terms of Lie racks, cf. [33]. There is, however, an even simpler answer suggested by hLie-algebras.
It appears to be a common phenomenon that some forms of integration are only possible after extending to the right cohomology in higher structures. For example, central extensions of Lie algebras do not, in general, integrate to central extensions of Lie groups. This obstruction, however, may be overcome by integrating to a Lie 2-group [34]. Similarly, the general integration of Lie algebroids only becomes possible after they are regarded as Lie 8-algebroids and integrated to Lie 8-groupoids, cf. [35].
We note that any Leibniz algebra canonically gives rise to an hLie-algebra, a weak Lie 2-algebra, cf. [1, Example 2.22] as well as proposition 4.1. From the standpoint of higher Lie theory, there has to be a natural extension of the usual integration theory of L8-algebras, cf. [36, 37], that allows for an integration of this weak Lie 2-algebra.
The higher version of the "coquecigrue problem," i.e. an integration of Leib8-algebras, would then be similarly resolved: each Leib8-algebra needs to be promoted by additional (higher) alternators to an EL8-algebra, which should then be integrable, in principle, by general higher Lie theory.
1.2. Conclusions and outlook
Besides giving the general definition for EL8-algebra in a fashion that can be readily used for explicit computations, we also develop the general structure theory to some extent:
3 The key to most of our discussion is the notion of hLie-algebras, which are differential graded Leibniz algebras in which the Leibniz bracket fails to be graded antisymmetric up to a homotopy given by an alternator, whose failure to be graded symmetric is controlled by a higher alternator, and so on ad infinitum.
3 Koszul dual to the operad hLie is the operad Eilh, and we can use semifree Eilhalgebras to define the homotopy algebras of hLie-algebras, which we call EL8algebras.
3 EL8-algebras come with a good notion of homotopy transfer and, correspondingly, with a minimal model theorem.
3 L8-algebras are special cases of EL8-algebras, and L8-algebra morphisms lift to EL8-algebra morphisms.
3 An EL8-algebra can be antisymmetrized to an L8-algebra which, when regarded as an EL8-algebra, is quasi-isomorphic to the original EL8-algebra. Correspondingly, any EL8-algebra is quasi-isomorphic to a differential graded Lie algebra.
3 Any differential graded Lie algebra gives naturally rise to an hLie-algebra, i.e. to a hemistrict EL8-algebra.
5

3 All of the above can be made explicit in terms of multilinear maps, at least order by order, and we give explicit formulas that should prove useful in future applications.
We can then show that given an hLie-algebra originating from a differential graded Lie algebra, adjusted notions of the curvatures of higher gauge theory are naturally found. These adjusted curvatures are precisely the ones of the tensor hierarchies of gauged supergravity for maximal supersymmetry. In the past, these gauge theories have been regarded as gauge theories of Leibniz algebras or various notions of enhanced Leibniz algebras, see our discussion in section 8. By the principles of categorification, it is clear that higher gauge algebras always have to be some higher form of Lie algebras, as these are the ones integrating to (higher) symmetry group. We show that the various forms of enhanced Leibniz algebras proposed in the literature are indeed axiomatically incomplete forms of hLie-algebras or weaker higher Lie algebras.
There are three main questions that remain or arise from our work. First, it would be certainly very interesting to explore further the relationship of our constructions to ones existing in the literature. We feel that e.g. Eilh-algebras should have appeared in other algebraic contexts; for example, the deformed Leibniz rule arising in hLie- and Eilhalgebras is very similar to the formula in [38, Theorem 5.1] for Steenrod's cup products.4
Second, in the antisymmetrization of an EL8-algebra to an L8-algebra, we used the explicit form of a particular contracting homotopy, cf. appendix A, which we had to compute order by order. It would be very nice to have complete analytical control over the homotopy.
Third, most of our applications of EL8-algebras involved them only in their hemistrict form, namely as hLie-algebras. This is due to the fact that we were only able to refine the derived bracket construction to a construction of an hLie-algebra from a differential graded Lie algebra. As we explain in section 7.2, there is a clear indication that some tensor hierarchies originate from EL8-algebras that are not hLie-algebras but that can be obtained from L8-algebras. This suggests a much wider generalization of the derived bracket construction, which would be certainly very useful to have. In particular, it would allow us to characterize a very large class of EL8-algebras for which the problem of defining the kinematical data of higher adjusted gauge theories, such as the data arising in the tensor hierarchies, is fully under control. Altogether, we believe that the general picture, both in generalized geometry and in higher gauge theory, will ultimately require using fully fledged EL8-algebras.
2. The operads hLie and Eilh
We start with the definition of the two Koszul-dual operads hLie and Eilh that underlie our definition of EL8-algebras. The invocation of operads provides us with a solid mathematical foundation of our constructions; the algebras over the operad hLie, however, will prove to be very interesting in their own right. For background on operads and Koszul

duality, see [39, 40, 30] as well as [41]. We stress, however, that more than an intuitive understanding of both topics is not required for our discussion.

2.1. The operad hLie
Differential graded Lie algebras are algebras over the differential graded operad Lie. In this section, we define a generalization of this operad whose algebras contain hemistrict Lie 2- and Lie 3-algebras, as defined in [1] and [3]. Besides a differential, Lie 2-algebras contain a binary operator of degree 0 and an alternator, i.e. a binary operator of degree ´1. In the case of Lie 3-algebras, we also obtain a higher alternator of degree ´2. It is thus natural to allow for higher alternators of arbitrary degree, and to minimally extend the algebraic relations known from Lie 2- and Lie 3-algebras in such a way that they are compatible with the differential. This leads to the following operad.

Definition 2.1. The operad hLie is a differential graded operad endowed with binary
N operations i2 of degree i for each i P " t0, 1, . . .u that satisfy the following relations:
1p1px1qq " 0 , 1pi2px1, x2qq " p´1qi`i2p1px1q, x2q ` p´1q|x1|i2px1, 1px2qq
` i2´1px1, x2q ´ p´1qi`|x1| |x2|2i´1px2, x1q , i2pi2px1, x2q, x3q " p´1qip|x1|`1qi2px1, i2px2, x3qq ´ p´1qp|x1|`iq|x2|i2px2, i2px1, x3qq (2.1)
´ p´1qp|x2|`|x3|q|x1|`pi´1q|x2|2i`1px2, i2´1px3, x1qq , j2pi2px1, x2q, x3q " p´1q1`jpi`1q`|x1|p|x2|`|x3|q`pj´1q|x2|2i`1px2, j2´1px3, x1qq , i2pj2px1, x2q, x3q " p´1qipj`|x1|qj2px1, i2px2, x3qq ´ p´1qp|x1|`jq|x2|i2px2, j2px1, x3qq
´ p´1qj`|x3|pj`|x2|´1q`|x1|p|x2|`|x3|q2i`1px3, j2´1px2, x1qq
N for all i, j P and j  i, where we regard ´2 1 " 0.
An algebra over the operad hLie, or an hLie-algebra for short, is then a graded vector space E together with a differential and a collection of binary products,

1 : E Ñ E , |1| " 1 , i2 : E b E Ñ E , |i2| " ´i ,

(2.2)

such that (2.1) are satisfied for all x1, x2, x3 P E.
We note that the first three relations in (2.1) for i " 0 amount to the relations for a differential graded Leibniz algebra with differential 1 and Leibniz product 02. If 12 vanishes, then 02 is graded antisymmetric, and the Leibniz bracket becomes Lie. If we restrict to the case i2 " 0 for i  0, we simply recover differential graded Lie algebras. If we restrict ourselves to 2-term hLie-algebras, i.e. hLie-algebras concentrated in degrees ´1 and 0, then only 02 and 12 can be non-trivial for degree reasons, and we obtain the hemistrict

7

Lie 2-algebras of [1] with a graded symmetric 12. The latter map is a chain homotopy sometimes called the alternator, capturing the failure of 02px1, x2q to be antisymmetric:

02px1, x2q ` p´1q|x1| |x2|02px2, x1q " 1p12px1, x2qq ` 12p1px1q, x2q ` p´1q|x1|12px1, 1px2qq .

(2.3)

If we restrict to hLie-algebras concentrated in degrees ´2, ´1, and 0, we recover the hemistrict version of the weak Lie 3-algebras of [3], which is again trivially verified. Later, we will see that hLie-algebras are generally the same as hemistrict EL8-algebras, and every EL8-algebra is equivalent or quasi-isomorphic to an hLie-algebra. This is the generalization of the statement that any L8-algebra is quasi-isomorphic to a differential graded Lie algebra.
One may be tempted to extend the definition of hLie-algebras to binary products of arbitrary integer degrees. This, however, would render them essentially trivial from a homotopy algebraic point of view, which we will discuss in section 2.3.
We close this section with two results on hLie-algebras that allow us to construct new hLie-algebras from existing ones. First, we can create a larger hLie-algebra by tensoring hLie-algebras with differential graded commutative algebras, just as in the case of Lie algebras,

Proposition 2.2. The tensor product of a differential graded commutative algebra and an hLie-algebra carries a natural hLie-algebra structure.

Proof. On the tensor product of a differential graded commutative algebra A and an hLiealgebra E, we define

E^ :" A b E " `kPNpA b Eqk ,

ÿ

pA b Eqk "

Ai b Ej ,

i`j"k

^i2pa1 b x1, a2 b x2q " p´1qip|a1|`|a2|qpa1a2q b i2px1, x2q ,

(2.4)

One then readily verifies the axioms (2.1).

Second, we note that the axioms (2.1) of hLie-algebras have some translation invariance built in, which allows us to construct new hLie-algebras by shifting degrees.

Proposition 2.3. Given an hLie-algebra pE, 1, i2q, there is an hLie-algebra structure on the grade-shifted complex E~ " sE with

~1psaq " ´s1paq , ~i2psa, sbq " p´1q|a|`is2i´1pa, bq .
Here, s is the shift isomorphism s : E Ñ Er´1s with that |sa| " |a| ` 1.

(2.5)

8

Proof. The proof is a straightforward check of the relations (2.1) for E~. The fact that ~1 is a differential is evident. The remaining relations follow rather directly by replacing all arguments xi in (2.1) by sxi, shifting all |xi| by 1, and pulling out factors of s using the rules (2.5). The resulting equations are then satisfied due to (2.1).

2.2. The operad Eilh
For our constructions, it will be convenient to have the Koszul-dual operad to hLie at our disposal.

Definition 2.4. The operad Eilh is a differential graded operad endowed with binary op-
N erations mi of degree5 i P that satisfy the following quadratic identities:

a mi pb mi cq " p´1qip|a|`1qppa mi bq mi c ` p´1q|a| |b|pb mi aq mi cq ,

Qpa mi bq " p´1qi`pQaq mi b ` p´1q|a|a mi Qb ` p´1qipa mi`1 bq ´ p´1q|a| |b|pb mi`1 aq .

(2.8)

We then have the following relation between hLie and Eilh

Proposition 2.5. The operad Eilh is the Koszul dual of the operad hLie.

This fact can be established by computation, preferably using a computer algebra program, see also [30, Section 7.6.4] for details. Instead of going into further details, let us construct the Chevalley­Eilenberg algebra of an hLie-algebra by constructing the corresponding differential-quadratic operad on a semifree Eilh-algebra.

5Note that mi should really be regarded as a binary function of degree i in order to identify the correct Koszul signs. For example,

t1 mi t2 :" mipt1, t2q , p´ mi p´ mj ´qqpt1, t2, t3q " p´1qj|t1|t1 mi pt2 mj t3q .

(2.6)

We start from an hLie-algebra E which we assume for clarity of the discussion to admit

a nice basis pq and whose underlying graded vector space can be dualized degree-wise. We will make this assumption for all the graded vector spaces from here on, mostly for

pedagogical reasons: it allows us to give very explicit formulas. More generally, one may

want to work with (graded) pseudocompact vector spaces, cf. the discussion in [42, §1.1].

Consider the graded vector space6 V :" Er1s° and together with its free, non-associative

which is, in fact, sufficient for the description of hLie-algebras.

(2.10)

Definition 2.6. We call an Eilh-algebra of the form pEpV q, Qq for some graded vector space V without any restrictions on the products mi beyond (2.7) semifree.
Semifree Eilh-algebras yield the Chevalley­Eilenberg description of hLie-algebras:

Definition 2.7. The Chevalley­Eilenberg algebra CEpEq of an hLie-algebra E whose differential and binary products are given by

1 : E Ñ E , i2 : E b E Ñ E ,

(2.12)

Here, || is shorthand for |t|, the degree of t in V .

In the case of Lie algebras and L8-algebras, the (homotopy) Jacobi relations are equivalent to a nilquadratic differential in the corresponding Chevalley­Eilenberg algebra, and this is also the case here:

Proposition 2.8. The equation Q2 " 0 for the differential of the Chevalley­Eilenberg algebra of an Eilh-algebra that is of the form (2.12) is equivalent to the relations (2.1).

Proof. The proof is again a straightforward but tedious verification of the axioms, which is better left to a computer algebra program.

Just as we can consider restricted hLie-algebras in which only a subset of the binary products i2 are non-vanishing, we can also restrict the image of Qt in EpV q. In the case
N N of Eilh-algebras, we can often further restrict the tensor products mi appearing in EpV q
from i P to i P I  , resulting in a tensor algebra EI pV q. We then obtain the following restriction theorem:

Theorem 2.9. The equation Q2 " 0 on a semifree Eilh-algebra EpV q is equivalent to Q2V " 0. If the differential Q closes on EI pV q, then Q2V " 0 is equivalent to Q2 " 0 on EpV q.
Proof. The condition Q2 " 0 on EI pV q is equivalent to the condition Q2 " 0 on V  EI pV q, which follows by direct computation, using the deformed Leibniz rule (2.8):

Q2pa mi bq " pQ2aq mi b ` a mi pQ2bq .

(2.13)

The same holds for Q2 " 0 on EI pV q, and combining both we obtain the desired result.

Note, however, that we cannot simply put the products mi " 0 for i R I if I does not contain 0. The deformed Leibniz rule (2.8) would render the lowest non-vanishing product graded symmetric or antisymmetric and the quadratic relations (2.7) would then imply severe restrictions on the products at cubic order. Restrictions of EpV q to EI pV q that are evidently sensible are of the form I " t0, . . . , nu.

2.3. Cohomology of semifree Eilh-algebras

An important tool in studying Lie algebras is Lie algebra cohomology, and we consider the generalization to hLie-algebras in the following. As we saw above, this amounts to the cohomology of semifree Eilh-algebras. Due to the deformation of the usual Leibniz rule to (2.8), a subtle and important point arises. For ordinary differential graded algebras, the cohomology again carries the structure of a differential graded algebra of the same type, with product induced from the product on the original algebra. In particular, the product of two cocyles is again a cocycle. The deformation of the Leibniz rules can now evidently break this connection.
To start, let us consider the cohomology of the semifree Eilh-algebra pEpV q, Q0q with the most trivial differential Q0 satisfying

Q0pvq " 0 , Q0pa mi bq " p´1qi`pQ0aq mi b ` p´1q|a|a mi Q0b
` p´1qipa mi`1 bq ´ p´1q|a| |b|pb mi`1 aq .

(2.14)

11

for all v P V and a, b P EpV q.

Proposition 2.10. The Q0-cohomology of pEpV q, Q0q is the vector space7 E0pÄ, V q, with the embedding map E0 : Ä, V ÞÑ EpV q defined by

ÿ E0pv1 d ¨ ¨ ¨ d vnq :" p¨ ¨ ¨ pvp1q m0 vp2qq m0 ¨ ¨ ¨ q m0 vpnq .
PSn

(2.15)

This vector space carries the evident structure of a differential graded commutative algebra.

Proof. It is clear that the image of E0 forms the kernel of Q0 inside Et0upV q and that

Et0upV q cannot contain any coboundaries. Moreover, it is easy to show that all cocycles are

coboundaries in the case of elements of V m, V : here, the kernel of Q0 consists of elements

of the form

v1 mi v2 ` p´1qi`|v1| |v2|v2 mi v1 " p´1qi´1Qpv1 mi´1 v2q .

(2.16)

For elements that are cubic and of higher order in V , the proof is subtle and lengthy, and we only sketch it here. We first restrict to elements a P EpV q of a particular degree and order in V , as both the deformed Leibniz rule (2.8) and the algebra relations (2.7) preserve these. We then split Qa P EpV q into polynomials of the same monomial type, i.e. the same order and type of products mi. These terms have to vanish separately. The condition Qa " 0 requires the application of the relations (2.7) d ´ 2 times, where d is the degree of a in V . This application enforces a particular symmetry structure on a which forces it to lie in the image of V .
We note that from the Koszul-dual perspective, this result is essentially evident since both pEpV q, Q0q as well as pÄ, V, dq are the Chevalley­Eilenberg algebras of the abelian Lie algebra on V .

Proposition 2.10 together with the usual arguments underlying a general Hodge­Kodaira decomposition8 then yield the following theorem:

Theorem 2.11. Consider the trivial semifree Eilh-algebra from proposition 2.10. Then we have the following contracting homotopy between EpV q and the differential graded commutative algebra pÄ, V, 0q:

H0

pEpV q, Q0q P0 pÄ, V, 0q ,

E0

(2.17c)

As usual, the map H0 is not unique. We give the general solution to lowest order in V and lowest product degrees in appendix A; we shall use these expressions later on.
We note that such a contracting homotopy for ordinary differential graded algebras often induces an algebra morphism  :" E0  P0. This is not the case here, as clearly paq mi pbq  pa mi bq in general. We shall return to this point in section 3.5.
The contracting homotopy (2.17a) has a number of important generalizations and applications. Here, we note that it evidently extends to differentials Qlin " Q0 ` d, where d : V Ñ V and d satisfies the ordinary Leibniz rules on EpV q and Ä, V :

H0 pEpV q, Q0 ` dq P0 pÄ, V, dq .
E0

(2.18)

Moreover, if we have a differential d : Ä, V Ñ Ä, V non-linear in d, we still have a corresponding contracting homotopy

H0 pEpV q, Q0 ` Q1q P0 pÄ, V, dq
E0

(2.19)

with

Q1 " E0  d  P0 .

We therefore arrive at the following statement:

(2.20)

Theorem 2.12. Any semifree differential graded commutative algebra pÄ, V, dq gives rise to the semifree Eilh-algebra pEpV q, Q0 ` E0  d  P0q.

We will pick up this thread of our discussion again later.

3. EL8-algebras 3.1. EL8-algebras and their morphisms We define EL8-algebras to be the homotopy version of hLie-algebras.

13

Definition 3.1. The differential graded operad EL8 " Tps´1hLie¡q is the cobar construction applied to the Koszul-dual cooperad hLie¡. An algebra over it is called an EL8-algebra.

This abstract definition needs to be unwrapped to become useful. To get a first explicit handle on EL8-algebras, we consider their Chevalley­Eilenberg algebras. For clarity, we restrict ourselves again to the cases where the graded vector space E comes with a nice basis and can be dualized degree-wise, cf. section 2.2. Then an EL8-algebra structure on a graded vector space E is encoded in a nilquadratic differential on the Eilh-algebra CEpEq :" EpV q for V " Er1s°.
The differential Q is fully specified by its action on V . With respect to a basis ptq on V , we encode this action in structure constants m taking values in the ground field as follows:

Qt " m  m t  mi11,2 t1 mi1 t2  mi11i22,3 pt1 mi1 t q mi2 t ` . . . . (3.1) Here the choice of signs  is a convention9 and we shall be more explicit below, cf. also (2.12). The structure constants m define higher products,

In : Ebn Ñ E ,

0 " m , 1pq " m , i2p, q " mi, , . . .

(3.2)

Inp1 , . . . , n q " mI,1...n  ,
N where I is a multi-index consisting of n ´ 1 indices i1, i2, . . . , P and we define |I| :"
i1 ` i2 ` . . .. The products In have degree ´|I|.

It is useful to identify the following special cases:

Definition 3.2. Let pE, Ikq be an EL8-algebra. If 0  0, we call E curved, otherwise E

is uncurved. An uncurved EL8-algebra is called hemistrict, if Ik " 0 for k  3. It is called

strict if it is hemistrict and i2 " 0 for i  0. Finally, E is called semistrict if

I n

"

0

for

I  p0, . . . , 0q.

Note that in the case of uncurved EL8-algebras, we can restrict EpV q to the reduced tensor product algebra EpV q defined in (2.10). In the following, all our EL8-algebras will be uncurved. Clearly, hemistrict EL8-algebras are simply hLie-algebras, and therefore EL8-algebras subsume differential graded Lie algebras.
As an example, let us consider a family of weak models of the string Lie 2-algebra
which we will use to exemplify many of our constructions in the following. We consider
R the graded vector space V " pg ` r1sqr1s°, where g is a finite-dimensional quadratic R (i.e. metric) Lie algebra with structure constants f and Cartan­Killing form  with
respect to a basis pq. On V , we introduce basis vectors t P gr1s° and r P r2s° of degrees 1 and 2, respectively. The differential is given by

Qt " ´f t m0 t ` p1 ´ qf pt m0 tq m0 t ´ 2 t m0 t , Qr " 0

(3.3)

9For L8-algebras, we follow the conventions of [44] for the structure constants and the differential in the Chevalley­Eilenberg algebra.

14

R with  P , and a direct calculation verifies Q2 " 0. This defines the family of EL8-
algebras stringwskk,pgq with the following underlying graded vector space and higher prod-

ucts:

R stringwskk,pgq :" p r1s ÝÝ0Ñ gq ,

2px1, x2q " rx1, x2s , 12px1, x2q " 2px1, x2q

(3.4)

030px1, x2, x3q " p1 ´ qpx1, rx2, x3sq ,

R for x P g and y P . All other higher products vanish. We notice that stringwskk,pgq is an R uncurved EL8-algebra for each  P . It becomes semistrict for  " 0 and hemistrict for
 " 1.

A second, much more general example is worked out in appendix B.

Another very general and useful example is the EL8-algebra of inner derivations innpEq of another EL8-algebra E. This is obtained as a straightforward generalization of the definition of the (unadjusted) Weil algebra of an L8-algebra.

Definition 3.3. The (unadjusted) Weil algebra of an EL8-algebra E is the Eilh-algebra

´ WpEq :"

í,

pEr1s° ` Er2s°q

,

QW

¯

,

(3.5)

where the Weil differential is defined by the relations

QW " QCE `  , QW " ´QW

(3.6)

with  : Er1s° Ñ Er2s° the shift isomorphism, trivially extended to WpEq by the (undeformed) Leibniz rule, i.e.

pa mi bq " p´1qi`a mi b ` p´1q|a|a mi b .

(3.7)

The EL8-algebra dual to WpEq is the inner derivation EL8-algebra innpEq of E.
In terms of semifree Eilh-algebras, the notion of a morphism of EL8-algebras becomes evident.
Definition 3.4. A morphism of EL8-algebras  : E Ñ E~ is a morphism dual to the corresponding morphism  : CEpEq Ñ CEpE~q of Eilh-algebras. For CEpEq " pEpV q, Qq and CEpE~q " pEpV~ q, Q~q, such a morphism is compatible with the differential,

Q   "   Q~ ,

(3.8)

and the product structure, px mi yq " pxq mi pyq
N for all x, y P CEpEq and i P .

(3.9)

15

Recall that the appropriate notion of equivalence for homotopy algebras is that of a quasi-isomorphism, which we make explicit in the following definition.
Definition 3.5. Two EL8-algebras E and E~ are called quasi-isomorphic if there is a morphism of EL8-algebras  : E Ñ E~ such that the contained chain map 1, the dual to the linear component of the dual morphism of Eilh-algebras , descends to an isomorphism between the cohomologies of E and E~.
We note that the cohomology H,1pEq of an EL8-algebra E is dual to the cohomology with respect to the linear part of the Chevalley­Eilenberg differential Q. In the case of the Weil algebra, the included shift isomorphism  renders the cohomology H,1pinnpEqq trivial. We therefore obtain a quasi-isomorphism between innpEq and the trivial EL8algebra, extending the situation for L8-algebras.
In the future, it may be useful to have an inner product structure on an EL8-algebra. The appropriate notion here, which could more formally be derived from lifting our above discussion to cyclic operads, is a simple generalization of cyclic structures on L8-algebras.

Definition 3.6. An EL8-algebra E is called cyclic if it is equipped with a non-degenerate graded-symmetric bilinear form x´, ´y : E ^ E Ñ K, where K is the ground field, such that

3.2. Homotopy transfer and minimal model theorem

A minimal characteristic of homotopy algebras is that they provide a nice notion of homotopy transfer. The latter will be important for all our future constructions, and we therefore develop a form of the homological perturbation lemma below.
We start from deformation retract between two differential graded complexes pE, 1q and pE~, ~1q. That is, we have chain maps p and e, together with a map h of degree ´1, which fit into the diagram

h

pE, 1q

p e

pE~, ~1q ,

(3.11a)

and satisfy the relations

p  e " idE~ , idE ´ e  p " h  1 ` 1  h , hh"0 , he"0 , ph"0 .

(3.11b)

We now want to consider the homological perturbation lemma for the semifree Eilh-algebras on EpV q and EpV~ q with differentials Q and Q~, respectively, defined by

V " Er1s° , Q " °1 and V~ " E~r1s° , Q~ " ~°1 .

(3.12)

Theorem 3.7. The deformation retract (3.11) lifts to the deformation retract

for all v P V and x, y P EpV q. The dual to the contracting homotopy is continued by a modification of the tensor trick,

H0pvq " h°pvq , H0px mi yq " p´1qiH0pxq mi E0pP0pyqq ` p´1qi`|x|x mi H0pyq
` p´1q|y|`|x| |y|H0pxq mi`1 H0pyq .
These maps satisfy the relations

(3.13c)

P0  E0 " idEpV~ q , idEpV q ´ E0  P0 " H0  Q ` Q  H0 , H0  H0 " 0 , H0  E0 " 0 , P0  H0 " 0 .

(3.13d)

Proof. The proof of (3.13d) is a straightforward computation for elements in m2,V . The general case follows then by iterating the algebra relations and applying (3.11b).

The higher products i with i  1 on E can now be regarded as a perturbation of the differential. Dually, we have a perturbation of Q,

Q Ñ Q^ :" Q ` Q .

(3.14)

We can then use the homological perturbation lemma [45, 46, 47] to transfer these structures over to higher products ~i on E~, or, dually, to a perturbed differential Q~ on EpV~ q. The
formulas for this are the usual ones, cf. [47].

Lemma 3.8. Starting from the deformation retract (3.13), we can construct another de-

formation retract with

H pEpV q, Q^q P pEpV~ q, Q^~q ,
E

(3.15a)

Q^ :" Q ` Q , Q^~ " Q~ ` P  Q  E0 ,
P :" P0  pid ` Q  H0q´1 , E :" E0 ´ H  Q  E0 , H " H0  pid ` Q  H0q´1 , (3.15b)

10The notation is chosen to match more closely the formulas of section 2.3.

17

where inverse operators are defined via the evident geometric series, such that

P  E " idEpV~ q , idEpV q ´ E  P " H  Q^ ` Q^  H , H0  H0 " H0  E " 0 , P  H " 0 ,

(3.15c)

Proof. The lemma follows from the usual perturbation lemma, cf. [47], with the specializa-

tion that E and P are here morphisms of Eilh-algebras. To see this, we note that Q acts as a derivation,

Qpx mi yq " p´1qi`pQxq mi y ` p´1q|x|x mi Qy .

(3.16)

Moreover, in the non-vanishing terms of
Ppx mi yq " pP0  pid ´ Q  H0 ` Q  H0  Q  H0 ´ . . .qpx mi yq " P0pxq mi P0pyq ´ P0pQpH0pxqq mi P0pyq ´ P0pxq mi P0pQpH0pxqqq ` ¨ ¨ ¨ , (3.17)
all the H0 are precomposed by a Q, as otherwise the map P0, which is precomposed to all summands, would annihilate the term due to P0  H0 " 0. The relation

Ppx mi yq " Ppxq mi Ppyq

(3.18)

follows then by a direct computation. The same holds for E.

We note that for small perturbations Q, the homological perturbation lemma 3.8 implies that
Q^~ " Q~ ` P0  Q  E0 ´ P0  Q  H0  Q  E0 ` P0  Q  H0  Q  H0  Q  E0 ´ ¨ ¨ ¨ . (3.19)
A direct consequence of homotopy transfer is the existence of minimal models for homotopy algebras. Consider the deformation retract (3.11) with pE~, ~1 " 0q " H,1pEq the cohomology of pE, 1q as well as p and e the projection onto the cohomology and a choice of embedding, respectively. Then the homotopy transfer yields the structure of a quasiisomorphic EL8-algebra on the cohomology of pE, 1q. This implies the minimal model theorem.

Theorem 3.9. Any EL8-algebra E comes with a quasi-isomorphic EL8-algebra structure on its cohomology H,1pEq. We call this a minimal model of E.

3.3. L8-algebras as EL8-algebras

As expected, L8-algebras are special cases of EL8-algebras.

Theorem 3.10. A semistrict EL8-algebra E is an L8-algebra. Conversely, any L8-

algebra is a (semistrict) EL8-algebra. Dually, the data contained in a differential Q in a

semifree Eilh-algebra

is equivalent to the data contained

in a differential Q~ on the semifree differential graded commutative algebra pÄ, V, Q~q.

18

Proof. It suffices to show the dual statement, which is a direct consequence of theorem 2.12.

Concretely, given an L8-algebra L with higher products µk this yields a semistrict EL8-algebra with higher products

#

Ik "

µk 0

for |I| " 0 , else .

(3.20)

Dually, we have agreement in the structure constants in the corresponding Chevalley­ Eilenberg differentials QL and QEL for the L8-algebra and its trivial lift to EL8-algebra up to combinatorial factors:

(3.21)

Conversely, any semistrict EL8-algebra E is an L8-algebra with higher products µk " 0k. As an example, consider the  " 0 case of the family of weak string Lie 2-algebra models (3.4). This is a semistrict EL8-algebra and therefore an L8-algebra.
For consistency, we obviously expect the following.

Theorem 3.11. Any L8-algebra morphism  : L Ñ L~ lifts to an EL8-algebra morphism ^ : L^ Ñ L^~, where L^ and L^~ are the L8-algebras L and L~, regarded as EL8-algebras.
Proof. We prove this statement again from the dual perspective. Let pÄ, V, Qq and pÄ, V~ , Q~q be the Chevalley­Eilenberg algebras of L and L~, respectively. The Chevalley­ Eilenberg algebras of L^ and L^~ are then

pEpV q, Q^ " Q0 ` E  Q  Pq and pEpV~ q, Q^~ " Q0 ` E  Q~  Pq ,

(3.22)

cf. theorem 2.12. The dual of the morphism ,  : CEpLq Ñ CEpL~q ,

(3.23)

trivially lifts to the following dual of an EL8-algebra morphism ^ : CEpL^q Ñ CEpL^~q with ^ pvq :" Eppvqq ,
and we note that ^  E " E  . It then follows that p^  E  Qqpvq " pE    Qqpvq ^ pQ^vq " pE  Q~  P  E  qpvq , ^ pQ^vq " Q^~^ pvq ,
and ^ is the dual to the desired morphism of EL8-algebras ^.

(3.24) (3.25)

3.4. 2- and 3-term EL8-algebras
Having identified L8-algebras within EL8-algebras, let us also make contact with the 2and 3-term EL8-algebras of [1] and [3], starting with the former.
In [48], Baez­Crans introduced semistrict Lie 2-algebras: linear categories equipped with a strictly antisymmetric bilinear functor, the categorified Lie bracket, that is only required to satisfy the Jacobi identity up to a coherent trilinear natural transformation, the Jacobiator. In [1] semistrict Lie 2-algebras were fully categorified to weak Lie 2-algebras by also relaxing antisymmetry to hold only up to a coherent natural transformation, the alternator. Of course, a weak Lie 2-algebra with trivial alternator is a semistrict Lie 2algebra. Similarly, a weak Lie 2-algebra with trivial Jacobiator is referred to as a hemi -strict Lie 2-algebra. If both the alternator and Jacobiator are trivial, it is a strict Lie 2-algebra.
By passing to its normalized chain complex, we transition from the categorical description containing many redundancies to a more convenient description in terms of differential graded algebras. In particular, a semistrict Lie 2-algebra is seen to be equivalent to a 2term L8-algebra [48], i.e. an L8-algebra with underlying graded vector space concentrated in degrees ´1 and 0. Analogously, by passing to its normalized chain complex, any weak Lie 2-algebra is seen to be equivalent to a 2-term EL8-algebra in the sense of [1], where the letter E was added to indicate that `everything' is relaxed up to homotopy.

Theorem 3.12. An EL8-algebra structure on a two-term complex concentrated in degrees ´1 and 0, E : E´1 ÝÝ1Ñ E0 has only three non-trivial higher products,

2 :" 02 : Ei b Ej Ñ Ei`j , 3 :" 030 : E0 b E0 b E0 Ñ E´1 , alt :" 12 : E0 b E0 Ñ E´1 .

(3.26a)

The map 2 is a chain map, and the maps alt and 3 are chain homotopies11

alt : 2p´, ´q ` 2p´, ´q  12 Ñ 0 , 3 : 2p´, 2p´, ´qq ´ 2p2p´, ´q, ´q ´ 2p´, 2p´, ´qq  12 Ñ 0 .

(3.26b)

11Here, 12 denotes the obvious permutation.

20

In addition, the higher products satisfy the relations

altpx1, x2q " altpx2, x1q , 3px1, x2, x3q ` 3px2, x1, x3q " 2paltpx1, x2q, x3q , 3px1, x2, x3q ` 3px1, x3, x2q " altp2px1, x2q, x3q ` altpx2, 2px1, x3qq

` 3px2, 2px1, x3q, x4q ` 3px2, x3, 2px1, x4qq for all xi P E0.

(3.26c)

Proof. Perhaps the easiest way of proving the above relations is to consider the correspond-

ing Chevalley­Eilenberg algebra (and we again assume, for simplicity, that the degree-wise

duals of E are nice, cf. section 2.2). That is, we consider the tensor algebra EpV q for V " Er1s°. The differential Q is determined by its action on the basis elements t. Since the latter can be of degree 1 or 2, it follows that Qt is of degree 2 or 3, and therefore it

has to be of the form

Qt " ´p´1q||m t ´ p´1q||p||´1q m0, t m0 t ´ p´1q||`||`||`||p||´1q`||p||`||´2q m00, pt m0 t q m0 t ´ p´1q||`||`||p||´1q m1, t m1 t ,

(3.27)

where the ptq form a basis on V . The above formula can be reduced further when we split ptq " pra, siq, where |ra| " 1 and |si| " 2:

Qra " ´maasa ´ mabc rb m0 rc , Qsi " ´miaj ra m0 sj ` maja sj m0 ra
` miabc pra m0 rbq m0 rc ´ niab ra m1 rb .

(3.28)

Defining

1pq " m , 2p, q " m0,  , 3p, ,  q " m00,  , altp, q " m1,  (3.29)
with respect to the basis pq of E, which is shifted-dual to the basis ptq of V " Er1s°, we readily verify that Q2 " 0 corresponds to the equations (3.26).

We note that this 2-term EL8-algebra is a degree-restricted version of the more general EL8-algebra given as an example in appendix B.

21

The properties (3.26), with a slightly weaker condition on alt, were given as the defining axioms in the definition of a 2-term EL8-algebra in the sense of [1].

Corollary 3.13. An EL8-algebra of the form considered in theorem 3.12 is a 2-term EL8-algebra in the sense of [1] with a graded symmetric alternator.

Our additional condition of graded symmetric alternator is, in fact, very natural. It guarantees a rectification to semistrict Lie 2-algebras, and we shall return to this point in section 3.5.
Let us also consider the Koszul-dual picture, which we have already encountered in the proof of theorem 3.12, in more detail. We note that in the Chevalley­Eilenberg algebra pEpV q, Qq for 2-term EL8-algebras, we can restrict the tensor products mi to i P I " t0, 1u by the restriction theorem 2.9. The corresponding restricted operad Eilht0,1u consists of two products m0 and m1, satisfying the relations

a m0 pb m0 cq " pa m0 b ` p´1q|a| |b|b m0 aq m0 c , ´p´1q|a|a m1 pb m1 cq " pa m1 b ` p´1q|a| |b|b m1 aq m1 c ,
a m0 pb m1 cq " p´1q|a|pa m0 bq m1 c , a m1 pb m0 cq " p´1q|a| |b|pb m0 aq m1 c ,

(3.30a)

and the differential satisfies the evident deformed Leibniz rule given by

Qpa m0 bq " pQaq m0 b ` p´1q|a|a m0 Qb ` a m1 b ´ p´1q|a| |b|b m1 a , Qpa m1 bq " ´`pQaq m1 b ` p´1q|a|a m1 Qb .

(3.30b)

The relations (3.30a) and (3.30b) are equivalent (up to some signs) to those defining the operad R! introduced in Squires [2] to capture 2-term EL8-algebras. The free algebra over R! is dual to our notion of 2-term EL8-algebra with a graded symmetric alternator altpx, yq " p´1q|x| |y|altpy, xq.
In [3], Dehling generalized Roytenberg's 2-term L8-algebras in order to find a small cofibrant resolution of the operad Lie, as mentioned in section 1.1. The partial resolution of Lie¡ was given up to degree three, yielding explicit formulas for 3-term EL8-algebras which were shown to be equivalent to weak Lie 3-algebras.
To make contact with Dehling's discussion, we consider a general EL8-algebra E concentrated in degrees ´2, ´1, and 0, and dualize immediately to a graded vector space V " Er1s° concentrated in degrees 1, 2, 3, V " V1 ` V2 ` V3. The limited degrees restrict the structure constants in the differential (3.1) as well as the resulting EL8-products:

m m0,12 , m1,12 , m2,12 m001,23 , m011,23 , m101,23
m0010,234

1 , 02 , 12 , 22 , 030 , 031 , 130 , 0400 .

(3.31)

22

Correspondingly, we can restrict EpV q to Et0,1,2upV q, according to the restriction theorem 2.9. Verifying the relations that Q2 " 0 imposes on the higher products, we arrive at the following theorem.
Theorem 3.14. An EL8-algebra E concentrated in degrees ´2, ´1, and 0 is the same as weak Lie 3-algebra in the sense of [3].
3.5. EL8-algebras as L8-algebras and the rectification theorem In section 3.3, we identified L8-algebras with semistrict EL8-algebras, which suggests that there should be a rectification of EL8-algebras to L8-algebras. This is indeed the case, as we show below.
We start with a projection of EL8-algebras onto L8-algebras, extending results of [1, 3].
Theorem 3.15. Any EL8-algebra pE, iq induces an L8-algebra structure on the graded vector space E. This L8-algebra structure is induced by homotopy transfer using the homotopy (2.18).
Proof. The proof is readily obtained by applying the homological perturbation lemma to the contracting homotopy

H0 pEpV q, Q0 ` Q1 ` Qq P0 pd,V, QLq ,
E0

(3.32)

cf. (2.18). Consider the Chevalley­Eilenberg algebra CEpEq of E, and split the differential Q " Q0 ` Q1 ` Q into Q0, a linear part Q1, and a perturbation Q. Then homotopy transfer yields a differential
QL " Q1 ` P0  Q  E0 ´ P0  Q  H0  Q  E0 ` P0  Q  H0  Q  H0  Q  E0 ` . . . (3.33)
on d,pEr1s°q. By construction, Q2L " 0. Moreover, QL satisfies the Leibniz rule on d,pEr1s°q: the deformation terms in the Leibniz rule (2.8) are graded antisymmetric, and this graded antisymmetry is preserved by subsequent applications of H and Q. The final projector P0 then eliminates these terms.
As an example, we can compute the antisymmetrization of a 2-term EL8-algebra and reproduce12 [1, Proposition 3.1].
12Due to different conventions, there is a relative minus sign between our µ3 and that of [1].

(3.36)

This is the differential for the Chevalley­Eilenberg algebra of pE, µiq with the higher products (3.34).

Similarly, we reproduce the antisymmetrization of 3-term EL8-algebras described in [3, Section 4] using the homotopy H0 given in (A.1) with the choice 1 " 2 " 0; a more comprehensive case will be discussed in section 4.2.
As observed already in [1, 3], the antisymmetrization map is functorial for 2-term EL8-algebras, and any morphism of EL8-algebra induces a morphism between the corresponding antisymmetrized L8-algebras. The antisymmetrization map fails, however, to be functorial for 3-term EL8-algebras. It is natural to conjecture that the antisymmetrization is n-functorial for an n-term EL8-algebra. We will not need this result and refrain from going further into these technicalities.
A new result is that this antisymmetrization map lifts indeed to a quasi-isomorphism of EL8-algebras.
Theorem 3.17. Let E be an EL8-algebra, and let E1 be the L8-algebra induced by theorem 3.15, regarded as an EL8-algebra. Then there is a quasi-isomorphism  : E Ñ E1.

24

Proof. We prove this statement again using the Chevalley­Eilenberg algebras CEpEq and CEpE1q. Note that as graded vector spaces, Er1s° " E1r1s°. If Q " Q0 ` Q1 ` Q is the differential on CEpEq, then the differential on CEpE1q reads as

Q1v " Q1v ` E0  P0  pid ` Q  H0q´1  Qv

(3.37)

for all v P Er1s°. We need to construct an invertible Eilh-algebra morphism  : EpEr1s°q Ñ EpEr1s°q satisfying Q " Q1. The desired morphism on Er1s° is13

pvq " pid ´ H0  Q ` H0  Q  H0  Q ´ . . .qpvq " pid ` H0  Qq´1pvq , (3.38)

and using

Q0  H0 " id ´ E0  P0 ´ H0  Q0 , Q0Q " ´Q2 ´ QQ0 ,

(3.39)

one readily verifies that Qv " Q1v for all v P Er1s°, which is sufficient. Since the

morphism is clearly invertible, this is a quasi-isomorphism.

We can now combine theorem 3.17, theorem 3.11 as well as the strictification theorem for L8-algebras to obtain the following.

Corollary 3.18. Any EL8-algebra is quasi-isomorphic to a differential graded Lie algebra, trivially regarded as an EL8-algebra.
More directly, this follows from the strictification theorem for generic homotopy algebras, see e.g. [30, Proposition 11.4.9].
Theorem 3.17 also shows that the choice of [1] not to symmetrize the alternator was perhaps not the best. It leads to a classification of 2-term EL8-algebras which is generally larger than that of L8-algebras [1, Theorem 4.5], contradicting the rectification theorem expected in line with the situation for L8-algebras.
A consequence of the strictification theorem and homotopy transfer is the following. Just as for hLie-algebras, we can also tensor an EL8-algebra by a differential graded commutative algebra14:

Theorem 3.19. The tensor product of an EL8-algebra and a differential graded commu-
tative algebra carries a natural EL8-algebra structure.
13This morphism implements a coordinate transformation such that the image of Q on v~ " pvq has no component in the subspace Q0H0EpEr1s°q. This then implies that it has no component in H0Q0EpEr1s°q either. The only remaining component is in E0P0EpEr1s°q, which implies that Q is the Chevalley­Eilenberg differential of an L8-algebra, trivially regarded as an EL8-algebra.
14One may be tempted to replace the differential graded commutative algebra with an Eilh-algebra, but already the product between an Eilh-algebra and an hLie-algebra does not carry a natural hLie-algebra structure.

25

Proof. We can invoke the argument presented in [49] for the existence of general ten-
sor products between certain homotopy algebras. That is, by corollary 3.18, E is quasiisomorphic to a hemistrict EL8-algebra Ehst, and the chain complexes A b Ehst and A b E are quasi-isomorphic. By proposition 2.2, A b Ehst carries an hLie-algebra structure, and the homological perturbation lemma allows us to perform a homotopy transfer from AbEhst to A b E, leading to the desired EL8-algebra structure.

Instead of using the above elegant but abstract argument, we can also perform a direct
computation in the dual Chevalley­Eilenberg picture. This leads to the following explicit formulas for the tensor product E^ " A b E of a differential graded commutative algebra A and an EL8-algebra E:

E^ :" A b E " `kPZpA b Eqk ,

(3.40)

3.6. Examples: String Lie algebra models

Let us illustrate the above structure theorems using the important and archetypal examples
of 2-term EL8-algebra models for the string Lie algebra. We have already encountered the EL8-algebras stringwskk,pgq in (3.4). A short computation using formulas (3.34) shows that these all antisymmetrize to the following 2-term L8-algebra:

R stringskpgq :" p ÝÝ0Ñ gq ,
µ2px1, x2q " rx1, x2s , µ3px1, x2, x3q " px1, rx2, x3sq .

(3.41)

It turns out that this L8-algebra (which is a minimal model for its quasi-isomorphism class) is quasi-isomorphic to a strict one,

R stringlppgq :" pL0g ` g ÝÝµÝ1Ñ P0gq ,
µ1p, rq "  , 1
µ2p1, 2q " r1, 2s , µ2p1, p, rqq " pr1, s, 2 d p91, q ,
0
µ3p1, 2, 3q " 0 ,

(3.42)

where L0g and P0g are the based path and based loop spaces of g, cf. [50]. There are two

quasi-isomorphisms,



stringskpgq

stringlppgq ,

(3.43)



26

and their explicit forms are found e.g. in [11]. This implies that there is a quasi-isomorphic

family of EL8-algebras that antisymmetrize to stringlppgq, which is readily found:

R stringwlpk,pgq :" pL0g ` ÝÝ1Ñ P0gq ,

1p, rq "  ,

12p1, 2q " `0, 2pB1, B2q

030p1, 2, 3q " pB1, rB2, B3sq .

(3.44)

Altogether, we can summarize the situation in the following commutative diagram:

^

stringswkk,pgq

stringwlpk,pgq

asym

^



asym

stringskpgq

stringlppgq



(3.45)

The morphisms asym are special cases of the antisymmetrization map (3.34), and the morphisms ^ and ^ are formed by lifts of the morphisms  and  as given by theorem 3.11.
Generically, on top of every L8-algebra, there is a family of EL8-algebras that antisymmetrize to it. The additional structure constants contained in the alternators of the
EL8-algebra will turn out to be crucial in the construction of higher gauge theories.

4. Relations to other algebras
In the following, we explain the relation between EL8-algebras and homotopy Leibniz algebras and, in particular, to differential graded Lie algebras. The latter prepares our interpretation of generalized geometry and the tensor hierarchies.

4.1. Relation to homotopy Leibniz algebras
Just as Lie algebras are Leibniz algebras that happen to have an antisymmetric Leibniz bracket, EL8-algebras are Leib8-algebras whose higher Leibniz brackets are antisymmetric up to homotopies. Homotopy Leibniz algebras were defined in [51, 52], and they are the homotopy algebras over the Zinbiel operad Zinb [53, 39] which, as suggested by the name15, is the Koszul-dual to the Leibniz operad Leib.
Explicitly, consider the semifree non-associative tensor algebra m,0V for a graded vector space V with only the first relation of (2.7) imposed. A (nilquadratic) differential Q on this algebra which satisfies the ordinary Leibniz rule then defines a homotopy Leibniz algebra.
15This nomenclature is a successful joke suggested by J. M. Lemaire. Zinbiel algebras are also known as (commutative) shuffle algebras, and the free Zinbiel algebra over a vector space is the shuffle algebra on its tensor algebra.
27

All the additional structure in Eilh (as well as the resulting additional structure in EL8algebras) capture the appropriate notion of symmetry up to homotopy of the higher Leibniz brackets.
Ordinary Leibniz algebras form an interesting source of 2-term hLie-algebras, which had been observed before:

Proposition 4.1 ([1]). Any Leibniz algebra induces canonically a hemistrict 2-term EL8algebra concentrated in degrees ´1 and 0.

Explicitly, let g be a Leibniz algebra, and write gann " rg, gs. Then Epgq " `Epgq´1 ÝÝ1Ñ Epgq0 :" `gann ãÝÝÑ g

(4.1)

is a differential graded Leibniz algebra, and we promote it to a 2-term EL8-algebra by

altpe1, e2q :" re1, e2s ` re2, e1s P gann

(4.2)

for all e1, e2 P g.16

4.2. hLie-algebras from differential graded Lie algebras and derived brackets

algebra

As

explained

in

[20],

this

is

a corollary to the result of [19] that the mapping cone of a morphism between two dif-

ferential graded Lie algebras carries a natural L8-algebra structure. In this section, we present a refinement of this associated L8-algebra to an hLie-algebra. The existence of the L8-algebra is then a corollary to the antisymmetrization theorem 3.15. Our construction extends the construction of Leib8-algebras from Leib-algebras in [55] as well as the construction of 2-term EL8-algebras from 3-term differential graded Lie algebras in [1].
Given a differential graded Lie algebra, we readily construct a grade-shifted hLie-

algebra.

Theorem 4.2. Given a differential graded Lie algebra pg, d, t´, ´uq with g " ÀkPZ gk, we
have an associated hLie-algebra

16We note that this result, together with theorem 3.15, immediately implies that any Leibniz algebra gives rise to a 2-term L8-algebra as shown separately in [54].

28

for all x1, x2 P E. Here,  :" dg|g´1 and |x1|E denotes the degree of x1 in E.

Proof. The proof is a straightforward verification of the axioms of an hLie-algebra (2.1), which is most conveniently done again with a computer algebra program.

Let us discuss the explicit form of the antisymmetrization in some more detail. We assume, as usual, that E admits a nice basis pq, so that Er1s° has a dual basis ptq. the Chevalley­Eilenberg differential then reads as

Qt " ´p´1q||m t ´ p´1qip||`||q`||p||´1q mi, t mi t ,

(4.5)

and we have the following theorem.

Theorem 4.3. For each hLie-algebra pE, ijq (with the above mentioned restrictions), there is an L8-algebra pE, µiq with first four higher products reading as

(4.6)

for all xi P E.

Proof. We use again theorem 3.15 and determine the Chevalley­Eilenberg differential (3.33) of pE, µiq using the explicit form of the homotopy (A.1), which allows us to compute QL up to quartic order. This produces the higher products (4.6) for 1 " 2 " 0.

We note that our choice 1 " 2 " 0 is, in fact, not the most natural one. One gets

an

expression for µ4 which does not vanish but involves nestings of two maps 02 and one map

22. In the case of hLie-algebras obtained from differential graded Lie algebras, we have

22 " 0, and therefore the distinction is irrelevant.

We can now compose the map from differential graded Lie algebras to hLie-algebras

with the antisymmetrization theorem 3.15. This reproduces the following propostion of [20],

which in turn is a specialization of [19]:

Proposition 4.4. Given a differential graded Lie algebra pg, d, r´, ´sq, we have an L8algebra structure on the truncated complex

Altogether, our above constructions suggest the following picture:

Theorem 4.2

Theorem 4.3

dg Lie algebra

L8-algebra

(4.10)

Proposition 4.4

Our formulas (3.33) show that this picture is true for differential graded Lie algebras concentrated in degrees d  ´3. For more general differential graded Lie algebras, this picture is still very plausible from the expression for (3.33). A complete proof, however, would require an explicit expression of the homotopy H0 to all orders, which is currently beyond our technical capabilities.
From proposition 4.4 it is also clear that µ4 in (4.6) vanishes because B3 " 0. Similarly, all even higher brackets µ2i with i  1 vanish, as the odd Bernoulli numbers Bk for k  3 vanish.
As a simple example, consider a quadratic Lie algebra g, and construct the differential graded Lie algebra

We thus recover the hemistrict EL8-algebra stringwskk,1pgq introduced in section 3.6. The antisymmetrization of this hLie-algebra then yields the skeletal string Lie 2-algebra model stringskpgq. Interestingly, a quick consideration of the case leads to the conclusion that there is no differential graded Lie algebra that reproduces the strict string Lie 2-algebra model stringlppgq " stringwlpk,0pgq. This points towards a possible extension of theorem 4.2 producing EL8-algebras from certain L8-algebras.
5. Generalized and multisymplectic geometry
We now come to our first two applications of EL8-algebras, or rather hLie-algebras: the symmetry algebras of symplectic L8-algebroids and, in a closely related way, a categorified version of higher Poisson algebras.
5.1. Generalized geometry from symplectic L8-algebroids The string Lie 2-algebra stringskpspinpnqq is a finite-dimensional L8-subalgebra of the 2term L8-algebra of symmetries associated to the Courant algebroid [56] over Spinpnq. It is therefore not surprising that the symmetries of symplectic L8-algebroids, are important sources for examples of EL8-algebras. This link was noticed before in [1] and [3], who constructed 2- and 3-term EL8-algebras. Here, we can present the general picture. We shall follow the conventions of [21].
Theorem 5.1. The symmetry algebra of a symplectic L8-algebroid18 is naturally an hLiealgebra.
Proof. The Chevalley­Eilenberg algebra of a symplectic L8-algebroids L is a differential graded Lie algebra. The differential is the Chevalley­Eilenberg differential, encoding the anchor and the higher maps on sections of L, and it is given by a vector field Q on L. The Lie bracket is the Poisson bracket induced by the symplectic form . Compatibility of the differential with the Lie bracket amounts to the condition LQ " 0, which is part of the definition of a symplectic L8-algebroid. The hLie-algebra of this differential graded algebra is a refined version of the symmetry algebra of the L8-algebroid, which is the L8-algebra obtained from the original differential graded Lie algebra via proposition 4.4.
This theorem explains the interest in extension of Leibniz algebras in the context of generalized geometry and double field theory. The generalized tangent bundles used there are indeed symplectic L8-algebroids (or symplectic pre-NQ-manifolds, as explained in [21]). Therefore, the relevant symmetry algebras are hLie-algebras, and the most prominently visible feature of them in all construction is their Leibniz brackets 02.
18cf. [21] for a definition
31

As a short example, let us work out the case of Vinogradov Lie n-algebroids, which generalize the Courant algebroid. The latter case, i.e. the case n " 2, was sketched in [1, Example 5.4]. The Vinogradov Lie n-algebroids are given as the graded vector bundles

VnpM q :" T °rnsT r1sM

(5.1)

over some manifold M . We introduce local coordinates xµ on the base M and extend these

to Darboux coordinates pxµ, µ, µ, pµq of degrees 0, 1, n ´ 1, n, leading to the canonical

symplectic form

 " dxµ ^ dpµ ` dµ ^ dµ and Q " µpµ .

(5.2)

This symplectic form induces the Poisson bracket

(5.4)

The algebra of functions C8pVnpM qq is identified with the smooth functions in xµ and

the analytical functions in the remaining coordinates, and it receives a grading from the

grading of the coordinates. The vector field Q is a natural differential on C8pVnpM qq, and Q2 " 0 is equivalent to tQ, Qu " 0.

We note that the Poisson bracket (5.3) is a Poisson bracket of degree ´n. We can now

shift the grading in the algebra of functions by `n to obtain the differential graded Lie

algebra

32

on M , respectively. The latter are the generalized vector fields on VnpM q. Restricted to these, 02 is (a generalization of the) Dorfman bracket, whose antisymmetrization yields the Courant bracket, and 12 is a natural contraction pXpM q`n´1pM qq^pXpM q`n´1pM qq Ñ n´2.
As an explicit example, let us briefly present the case n " 2 for some manifold M .
Here, we have the 2-term hLie-algebra E with underlying differential complex

Following [21], one readily extends this discussion to the pre NQ-manifolds underlying double field theory to reproduce the D- and C-brackets there.
Another specialization of symplectic L8-algebroids is that described by the differential graded algebra given by the Batalin­Vilkovisky (BV) complex of a classical field theory, cf. [44] for definitions and conventions. Here, we have a Poisson bracket of degree ´1 and a BV complex

where F is the full BV field space and the Ci8 contains (the coordinate functions for) ghosts or gauge parameters for i " 1, fields for i " 0, antifields for i " ´1, and antifields of ghosts

for i " ´2. If we shift this complex by ´1, we obtain a differential graded Lie algebra,

which then gives rise to an hLie-algebra. At the moment, we do not have a concrete

interpretation of this EL8-algebra.

5.2. Multisymplectic geometry
There is a close relation between the associated L8-algebras of L8-algebroids and multisymplectic geometry, as explained in [23] and [57].

33

A multisymplectic manifold pM, q of degree p, or a p-plectic manifold, is a manifold M with a closed differential form P p`1pM q which is non-degenerate in the sense that X " 0 implies X " 0 for all X P XpM q.

(5.12)

In previous work [23, 24], it was realized that the shifted complex LpM, qr´1s restricted to non-positive degrees carries an L8-algebra as well as a differential graded Leibniz algebra. The situation is, in fact, a bit richer.

Theorem 5.2. The complex LpM, q carries a natural differential graded Lie algebra structure with the Lie bracket t´, ´u given by

tX1, X2u :" rX1, X2s , tX1, 1u :" LX1 1 , t1, 2u :" p1q2 ´ p´1q|1| |2|p2q1 for all X1, X2 P XpM q and 1,2 P LpM, q with |1,2|LpM, q  0.

Proof. The proof is a straightforward verification of the axioms of a differential graded Lie algebra.

Via theorem 4.2, the above theorem has the following corollary.

The antisymmetrization of this hLie-algebra is the L8-algebra described in [23, 24].
Note that the special case M " S3 and " volS3, upon restricting to left-invariant objects, yields another derivation of the hemistrict string EL8-algebra model stringswkk,1pgq.

6. Higher gauge theory with EL8-algebras
In this section, we develop and explore the generalities of higher gauge theory using EL8algebras as higher gauge algebras.

6.1. Homotopy Maurer­Cartan theory for EL8-algebras

Recall that given an L8-algebra L with higher products µi, there is a functor MCpL, ´q taking a differential graded commutative algebra a to Maurer­Cartan elements with values

in a, cf. e.g. [58]. This functor is represented by the Chevalley­Eilenberg algebra CEpLq of
the L8-algebra. What we usually call Maurer­Cartan elements in L are Maurer­Cartan elements with
R R values in , where the latter is regarded as a trivial differential graded algebra a with R underlying vector space , spanned by a generator w subject to the relation w2 " w, and
trivial differential. For concreteness sake, let us assume that L is degree-wise finite, and let ptAq be the
R generators of Lr1s° dual to some basis pAq of L. A Maurer­Cartan element is encoded
in a morphism of differential graded commutative algebras a : CEpLq Ñ a, which is fully determined by the image of the generators ptq of degree 0,

R a : CEpLq Ñ , t ÞÑ aw

(6.1)

R for a P . Dually, we have an element a :" a P L1, the gauge potential. Compatibility
with the differential requires the curvature

to vanish, and the equation f " 0 is called the homotopy Maurer­Cartan equation. This curvature satisfies the Bianchi identity

ÿ1 k! µk`1pa, . . . , a, f q " 0 .

(6.3)

Infinitesimal gauge transformations are obtained from infinitesimal homotopies between
R morphisms from CEpLq to . They are parameterized by elements c P g0 and act according

to

ÿ1

ca " k! µk`1pa, . . . , a, cq .

(6.4)

i0

Higher homotopies yield higher gauge transformations.

Similarly, one defines Maurer­Cartan elements of an A8-algebra with values in a differential graded algebra.

In the case of EL8-algebras, we can still consider tensor products of a base EL8algebra E and a differential graded commutative algebra A. However, the Chevalley­

Eilenberg algebra CEpEq is an Eilh-algebra and not a differential graded commutative

algebra. Therefore the homotopy Maurer­Cartan functor cannot be represented by it

directly.

35

There are two loopholes to this obstruction. First, we can lift the differential graded commutative algebra A, if it is semifree, to an Eilh-algebra A^ as explained in theorem 2.12.
We can then consider Eilh-algebra morphisms

a : CEpEq Ñ A^ .

(6.5)

Second, we can project CEpEq to the Chevalley­Eilenberg algebra of the L8-algebra L induced by E and consider the usual morphisms

a : CEpLq Ñ A .

(6.6)

A third approach is simply to consider general morphisms of Eilh-algebras. In particular, one may want to replace differential forms with more general objects, cf. also [59].
We note that, in general, the three different types of morphism will give rise to different sets of Maurer­Cartan elements with the first one encompassing the second one. In all the applications we are aware of, however, the second approach is the appropriate one. While the difference between an EL8-algebra and the corresponding L8-algebra obtained by antisymmetrization is then invisible at the level of homotopy Maurer­Cartan theory, the additional algebraic structure in an EL8-algebra is important in adjusting non-flat higher gauge theories.

6.2. Adjustment of higher gauge theory

In the construction of a higher gauge theory from an EL8-algebra E, we will always employ the corresponding L8-algebra L obtained from theorem 3.15. We then consider its Weil algebra, which is the Chevalley­Eilenberg algebra of the inner derivations of L,

´

¯

WpLq " d, pLr1s° ` Lr2s°q, QW , QW " QCE `  ,

(6.7)

where QCE is the Chevalley­Eilenberg differential of L and  is the shift isomorphism  : Lr1s° Ñ Lr2s°, extended to a morphism of differential graded commutative algebras.
The local kinematical data of an unadjusted higher gauge theory over a patch U of some manifold M is given by a differential graded algebra morphism

A : WpLq ÝÑ ,pM q .

(6.8)

This yields the definition of gauge potentials (the images of Lr1s°), curvatures (the images of Lr2s° together with compatibility of A with the differentials on Lr1s°) and Bianchi identities (compatibility of A with the differentials on Lr2s°). Infinitesimal gauge transformations are given as partially flat homotopies between two such morphisms, and they are therefore determined by the form of the curvatures. For details, see the original discussion in [16]; the worked examples in [11] may also be helpful.
One severe issue with this direct definition of higher gauge theory is that consistency of the gauge algebroid (read: closure of the BRST differential) requires the so-called fake curvature condition, which is highly restrictive [11], as mentioned in the introduction.

36

Within supergravity, this problem had been solved in a special case corresponding to the string Lie 2-algebra (3.41) by working with different curvatures [13, 14]. As shown in [15], this kinematical data can be obtained from a morphism (6.8) after a modification of the Weil algebra, which also results in nicer mathematical properties. Such a modification can be performed for a large class of higher gauge theories, and an appropriately modified Weil algebra was termed adjusted Weil algebra in [11], where also a number of examples were worked out that are relevant to the (1,0) tensor hierarchies of gauged supergravity. In fact, all the kinematical data arising within the tensor hierarchies seem to be adjusted higher gauge theories, and we shall return to them in section 7. Moreover, the additional structure constants arising in the adjustment seem to originate from the higher products contained in EL8-algebras that antisymmetrize to the gauge L8-algebra. While we do not have a complete picture of the situation yet, we develop a partial one in the next section, which is sufficient for the treatment of tensor hierarchies in maximally supersymmetric gauged supergravities.

6.3. Firmly adjusted Weil algebras from hLie-algebras

Special cases of Weil algebras that are adjusted and whose corresponding morphisms (6.8) into differential forms yield adjusted higher gauge theories with closed BRST complex are the following ones:

Definition 6.1. A firmly adjusted Weil algebra of an L8-algebra L is a differential graded commutative algebra obtained from the Weil algebra WpLq by a coordinate change

t^A ÞÑ t^1A :" t^A ` pAB1B2...BmC1C2...Cn t^B1 ¨ ¨ ¨ t^Bm tC1 ¨ ¨ ¨ tCn ,

(6.9)

where tA P Lr1s°, t^A P Lr2s°, m  1, and n  0, such that the image of the resulting differential Qfadj on generators in Lr2s° contains no generator in Lr1s° except for at most one of degree 1.

We note that putting the generators ptAq to zero still recovers the Chevalley­Eilenberg algebra CEpLq of L. In this sense, the coordinate change has not changed the underlying L8-algebra. Moreover, note that any Weil algebra is fully contractible in the sense that the cohomology of its linearized differential is trivial. Dually, it is the Chevalley­Eilenberg algebra of an L8-algebra which is quasi-isomorphic to the trivial L8-algebra. The nontrivial information contained in the Weil algebra is the relation between the generators ptAq and ptAq, which translates under the morphism (6.8) into the relation between gauge potentials and their curvatures. Our coordinate change thus changes the definition of the curvatures and, as partially flat homotopies describe gauge transformations, also the gauge transformations. Firmly adjusted Weil algebras ensure that the corresponding BRST complex closes: the restricted terms govern the Bianchi identities, which fix the gauge transformations of the curvatures. Closure of the latter is what induces the fake curvature conditions, cf. the discussion in [11, section 4.4]. Thus, firmly adjusted Weil algebras are adjusted Weil algebras in the sense of [11].

37

As an example, consider the following firmly adjusted Weil algebra of the string Lie 2-algebra (3.41):

r P r2s° and t^ " t, r^ " r. Under the morphism (6.8), this firmly adjusted Weil algebra

gives rise to the usual string connections

(6.11)

More generally, consider an L8-algebra obtained from an hLie-algebra by antisymmetrization. For simplicity, we also assume that the L8-algebra has maximally ternary brackets. Its Weil algebra then reads as

QWt

´p´1q||m t

.

In general, this Weil algebra is clearly not firmly adjusted because of the explicit form of QWt^. Let us therefore perform the coordinate change

t^ ÞÑ t^1 :" t^ ` st^t .

(6.13)

The new Weil differential then reads as follows. Q1Wt^1 " p´1q||m t^1 ` p´1q1`||s t^1t^1 ` p´1q||p||´1q m t^1t ` ` ´ p´1q||m s ` p´1q||sm ` p´1q||`||sm t^1 t ` ¨ ¨ ¨ ,

(6.14)

where the ellipsis denotes cubic and higher terms. Let us now further restrict to hLie-
algebras obtained from a differential graded algebra via theorem 4.3 with differential  and structure constants f. In this case, we have

(6.16)

We conclude with the following theorem.

38

Theorem 6.2. Given an L8-algebra with maximally ternary brackets that is obtained from the antisymmetrization of a differential graded Lie algebra by proposition 4.4, then there is
a corresponding firmly adjusted Weil algebra. The data necessary for an adjustment arises
from the alternators in the corresponding hLie-algebra.
Below, we shall give examples motivated from higher gauge theory. We stress, however, that the definition of an adjustment is also interesting for purely algebraic considerations, as it allows for the definition of a differential graded algebra of invariant polynomials for an L8-algebra which is compatible with quasi-isomorphisms of this L8-algebra, cf. the discussion in [11].
We also note that our construction highlights the features needed for obtaining a firmly adjusted Weil algebra. In particular, it is not necessary that the hLie-algebra was obtained from a differential graded Lie algebra; it was sufficient that there be a relation between the parameters s of the coordinate change and the structure constants f of the Lie algebra to ensure that (6.14) reduces to (6.16). This is the case, for example, in the tensor hierarchies in non-maximally supersymmetric gauged supergravity.

6.4. Example: (1,0)-gauge structures

As a first more involved example of EL8-algebras arising in the context of higher gauge theory, let us consider the higher gauge algebra defined in [60], see also [4, 11, 61]. This
algebra is a specialization of the general non-abelian algebraic structure identified in [62]
and can be derived from tensor hierarchies, to which we shall return shortly. The latter had
received an interpretation as an L8-algebra with some "extra structure" before, cf. [63] as well as [64]. Here, we show that it is, in fact an EL8-algebra.

7. Tensor hierarchies
Tensor hierarchies are particular forms of higher gauge theories that were introduced in the context of gauging maximal supergravity theories [65, 66, 67, 68, 69]. They are constructed using the embedding tensor formalism, introduced in [70, 71, 72, 73]. For comprehensive reviews see [6, 7]. Tensor hierarchies are also crucial to, for example, conformal field theories such as the N " p1, 0q superconformal models of [62, 74, 75].
Although initially applied to gauged supergravity theories, tensor hierarchies do not require supersymmetry and appear through the embedding tensor formalism applied to the gauging of a broader class of Einstein­Maxwell-matter theories, as discussed in [69, 76].

7.1. Physical context

Before analyzing the algebraic structure underlying tensor hierarchies in more detail, let us briefly review the physical context. Consider the Lagrangian of ungauged Einstein­ Maxwell-scalar theory in d dimensions,

(7.1)

with scalars x mapping spacetime to a scalar manifold M and 1-form abelian gauge potentials Ai with field strengths F i " dAi. Here, gxypq and aijpq are symmetric and positive-definite on the entire scalar manifold M. The ellipsis denotes possible deformations, such as a scalar potential Vpq or topological terms such as, e.g., dijkF i ^ F j ^ Ak for d " 5, as familiar from supergravity. The set of constant tensors controlling these

deformation terms, which includes those appearing in the tensor hierarchies that do not

enter (7.1), will be referred to as deformation tensors.

We assume that there is a global symmetry group G acting on scalars and 1-form po-

tentials such that the undeformed action (7.1) is invariant under this action. In particular,

41

the total gauge potential one-form A takes value in a representation V´1 of G, which is isomorphic to the fibers of the tangent space of the scalar manifold. In the presence of deformations, we assume that there is a non-abelian subgroup K  G leaving the full action invariant.
Infinitesimally, the corresponding Lie algebra actions of g " LiepGq on the scalars and the gauge potential are given by

x " kxpq , Ai " tijAj ,

(7.2)

where tij,  " 1, 2, . . . , dim g, are the generators of g in the representation V´1 with
respect to some bases e of g and ei of V´1. Invariance under G requires that kpq be Killing vectors of the scalar manifold and Lkaij " ´2 tkpiajqk.
In order to gauge19 a subgroup H  K  G with Lie algebra h " LiepHq, we first note
that we can trivially regard the pair pV´1, g) as a differential graded Lie algebra

V " p V´1 ÝÝ0Ñ V0 " g q

(7.3)

with evident Lie bracket on V0 and the Lie bracket r´, ´s : V0 ^ V´1 Ñ V´1 given by the action of g on V´1. Because the gauge potential takes values in V´1, it does not make sense to gauge a Lie subalgebra of g which is larger than V´1. Therefore, we can identify the subalgebra h with the image of a linear map

 : V´1 h  g , ei ÞÑ ie .

(7.4)

The pieq then form a spanning set20 of the Lie algebra h. Moreover, we have an induced action of h on V´1, given by

pieq  ej " itj kek ": Xij kek

(7.5)

with

tj k " ´tkj and tij tj k ´ tij tj k " ´f tik .

(7.6)

In order to guarantee closure of the Lie bracket on h and consistency of the action, we can assume that we can incorporate  into (7.3) such that

V " p V´1 ÝÝÑ V0 " g q

(7.7)

is again a differential graded Lie algebra. To jump ahead of the story, note that this guarantees the existence of a higher gauge algebra via proposition 4.4, which we anticipate as part of the construction of a higher gauge theory. The fact that  is a derivation for the graded Lie bracket then implies the quadratic closure constraint

19That is, we promote a global symmetry H to a local one by adding a principal H-bundle on our spacetime and consider (a part of) the one-form potential as a connection on this bundle.
20but not necessarily a basis

42

It is well known that this quadratic closure constraint implies that the Xijk form the structure constants of a Leibniz algebra on V´1,

ei  ej :" Xijkek ,

(7.9)

cf. e.g. [77, 78, 79]. This is unsatisfactory given that the 1-form gauge potentials A will take values in V´1 and V´1 should therefore have some Lie structure. As noted in [11], and as evident from proposition 4.1, this Leibniz algebra can be promoted to an hLie-algebra. Moreover, the fact that we have the differential graded algebra (7.7) guarantees that we will have an hLie-algebra via theorem 4.3 (or, if preferred, the corresponding L8-algebra obtained from theorem 4.3). This will turn out to be indeed the higher gauge algebra underlying the tensor hierarchies.
But let us continue with the tensor hierarchy from the physicists' perspective. The quadratic closure constraint (7.8) allows us to introduce a consistent combination of a covariant derivative on the scalar fields and local transformations parameterized by p0q P C8pM q b V´1:

i :" di ` j Ajkipq , p0q i :" p0qij kj pq , p0q Ai :" dp0qi ` XjkiAj p0qk .

(7.10)

Note that the action (7.9) of V´1 on V´1 is usually not faithful, and the parameterization by i is thus usually highly degenerate.

In light of our above discussion of the higher Lie algebra arising from the Leibniz al-

gebra (7.9), it is not surprising that the naive gauge transformation (7.10) of the gauge

This allows us to introduce a V´2-valued 2-form potential B and a V´2-valued 1-form gauge parameter p1q to generalized gauge transformations and curvatures as usual in higher gauge theory:

where here  is the covariant derivative given by the natural action of h on V´2 and the ellipses refer to covariantizing terms that are needed to complete the kinematical data to that of an adjusted higher gauge theory. In particular, the latter will include terms involving the various deformation tensors. This process is then iterated in a reasonably obvious fashion until the full kinematical data of an adjusted higher gauge theory is obtained21.

21The fact that this iteration terminates is guaranteed because spacetime is finite-dimensional.

43

In the gauged supergravity literature there is also often a linear representation con-

straint

P "  ,

(7.13)

where P is the projector onto the representation contained in V1° b g carried by , which will be denoted . This can be understood as a requirement of supersymmetry [72, 65], the mutual locality of the action [66] or anomaly cancellation [80].

A final important ingredient is now that the electromagnetic duality contained in U-

duality needs to link potential p-forms to potential d ´ p ´ 2-forms, and correspondingly the G-modules V´p and Vp`2´d have to be dual to each other in the lowest degrees that involve physical gauge potentials.

The above constraints restrict severely the choices of representations V´2, V´3. In table 1 we listed some important concrete examples of maximal supergravities, in which K " G. In this case, there is a tensor hierarchy dgLa determined by the U-duality group [81, 82],

with graded vector space described in Table 1 and derivation given by the action of . Also,

the electromagnetic duality is visibly reflected in the duality of representations in the cases

Table 1: Global symmetry groups G of maximal supergravity in 3  d  7 spacetime dimensions and their maximal compact subgroups (ignoring discrete factors). The G representations V´p are carried by p-forms in the tensor hierarchy. The scalars (0-forms) are valued in M :" G{G0, where G0  G is the maximal compact subgroup.

We note that in the presence of generic deformations, the differential graded Lie algebra constructed in the maximally supersymmetric case is actually insufficient and needs to be extended further by at least one step in both directions. We shall explain this below, when discussing the example d " 5.

7.2. Generic tensor hierarchies

Let us ignore the link between tensor hierarchies and gauged supergravity for a moment; clearly, the resulting kinematical data is potentially of interest in higher gauge theory in a much wider context.
The construction prescription is rather straightforward. We consider a Lie algebra g, which we enlarge to a differential graded Lie algebra

where we allowed for additional vector spaces Vi with i  0. All vector spaces Vi are g-modules, and the Lie bracket on V0 as well as the Lie brackets on V0 b Vi are given. Further Lie brackets r´, ´s : Vi b Vj Ñ Vi`j can be introduced, but due to the Jacobi identity, the underlying structure constants have to be invariant tensors of g (as we shall also see below in an example). The differentials do not have to satisfy this restriction. As an additional constraint, we can also impose the condition that V´°p " Vp`2´d as required by the U-duality condition from supergravity. This can be useful in the construction of action principles.
To illustrate the above, let us construct a generic example in d " 5. Let g be a Lie algebra and V´1 any representation. Imposing the duality constraint and allowing for an extension in one degree on either side leads to the differential complex

Let us now switch to the Chevalley­Eilenberg description CEpV q of the differential graded Lie algebra V we want to construct, which is generated by coordinates rµ, r, ra, ra, r,
rµ of degrees 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively. We note that we have a natural symplectic form on V r1s° of degree 5,

 " dr ^ dr ` dra ^ dra ` drµ ^ drµ .

(7.16)

where besides the structure constants f and the embedding tensor a we have the deformation tensors dabc and Zab, which are totally symmetric and antisymmetric, respectively, due to the grading of the generators. The remaining structure constants will be
called auxiliary. For Q to give rise to a Chevalley­Eilenberg differential, we have to impose

Q2 " 0 ô tQ, Qu " 0 .

(7.20)

22This restriction is required to obtain a differential graded Lie algebra, as opposed to an L8-algebra

45

This equation imposes conditions on the structure constants. For example, we have

a f  ` tabb ´ g1µg3µa " 0 .

(7.21)

For g1 " g3 " 0, this implies that the embedding tensor is an invariant tensor, which is clearly too strong a condition. We can make a non-canonical choice of an embedding

i : cokerpq ãÑ g ,

(7.22)

which is given by structure constants iµ such that iµg1 " µ .

(7.23)

With this choice, we can split the condition (7.21) into

ca f  ` Xcbab " 0 , iµpa f  ` tabbq " g3µa ,

(7.24)

and the first condition is the usual one encountered in the d " 5 tensor hierarchy, while the second condition fixes one of the auxiliary structure constants. Besides the above condition and the fact that f and tab are the structure constants of the Lie algebra g and a representation of g, we also have

Zabb " 0 , Zabdacd ´ 2Xpacdq " 0 ,
tpaddbcqd " 0 ,

ag1µ " 0 , Zarbtacs ` 2g1µg4bcµ " 0 ,

(7.25)

as well as a number of conditions for the auxiliary structure constants. As expected, the tensor dabc capturing the Lie bracket V´1 b V´1 Ñ V´2 has to be an invariant tensor.
The kinematical data of a generic tensor hierarchy can then be constructed from the firmly adjusted Weil algebra of the corresponding L8-algebra as described in detail in section 6.3.
We note that the condition that dabc be an invariant tensor is to strong a constraint, e.g. for the non-maximally supersymmetric case. From the formulas of the curvatures, it is clear that there is no differential graded Lie algebra underlying this case, if the higher gauge algebra is constructed using the formulas of theorem 4.2. This observation strongly suggests that there are generalizations of these derived bracket constructions, but this is beyond the scope of this paper.

7.3. Example: d " 5 maximal supergravity
Let us give a concrete and complete picture of the interpretation of a tensor hierarchy using hLie-algebras, including the construction of curvatures. We choose the case d " 5, which allows us to recycle observations made in section 7.2. For a detailed discussion of this theory, see [83].

Maximal supergravity in d " 5 dimensions has the non-compact global symmetry group
R E6p6qp q [84]. When dimensionally reducing from d " 11, in order to make manifest the
e6p6q structure of the scalar sector in d " 5, one must first dualize the 3-form potential, as
R described in detail in [85]. This gives a total of 42 scalars parameterizing E6p6qp q{USpp8q. R The fully dualized bosonic Lagrangian with manifest E6p6qp q-invariance can be written
as

The 1-form potentials transform linearly in the 27c of e6p6q, and a, b, c P t1, . . . , 27u. In addition to the singlet 1 P 27c b 27, used to construct the 1-form kinetic term, there is a singlet in the totally symmetric 3-fold tensor product 1 P Ä3p27cq, which is used to
construct the topological cubic term.

For the construction of the tensor hierarchy, we shall need the following E6-invariant

tensors:

To optimize our notation, we also introduce the following tensors:

Xabc " atbc , Xa " a f ,

Ya " a f ` tabb " b , Zab " ctdadbcd " Xcdadbcd " Zrabs ,

(7.28)

The above tensors satisfy the following identities [83]:

dacddbcd " ab , Xpabqc " dabdZcd , Xrabsc " 10dadf dbegdcdeZfg ,

(7.29a)

and in addition, we have the following three equivalent forms of the closure constraints:

2Xra|c|dXbsde ` XrabsdXdce " 0 , ZabXbcd " 0 , XdcraZbsc " 0 .

(7.29b)

Using these, we can now apply the formalism of section 7.2 and construct the differential graded Lie algebra. It helps to broaden the perspective a bit and derive the latter from a graded Lie algebra V , with underlying vector space consisting of e6p6q-modules:

The graded Lie bracket on V is now given mostly by the obvious projections of the

(7.39c)

where we used that tcradbscd is the intertwiner between the 351c P 27c b 78 and 351c ­ 2 27.
We can now construct the corresponding curvatures. We start from the Chevalley­ Eilenberg algebra of Ee6p6q with the following generators prAq spanning Ee6p6qr1s°:

(7.40)

Consider now the Weil algebra WpEe6p6qq, cf. definition 3.3. Here, we introduce a second copy of shifted generators pr^Aq spanning Ee6p6qr2s° with |r^A| " |rA| ` 1. The usual Weil
differential up to degree 3 elements, dual to scalars in d " 5, then reads as

QWra " ´Zabrb ´ Xbcarb m0 rc ` r^a , QWra " ar ` Xbacrb m0 rc ´ dabcrb m^ 1 rc ` r^a , QWr " Yara ` Xara m0 r ` tabra m^ 1 rb ` r^ , QWr^a " Zabr^b ` Xbcar^b m0 rc ´ Xbcarb m0 r^c , QWr^a " ´ar^ ´ Xbacr^b m0 rc ` Xbacrb m0 r^c ` 2dabcr^b m^ 1 rc , QWr^ " ´Yar^a ´ Xar^a m0 r ` Xara m0 r^ ´ tabr^a m^ 1 rb ` tabr^b m^ 1 ra ,
(7.41) where we have introduced the notation

a m^ i b " a mi b ` p´1qi`|a| |b|b mi a , a m i b " a mi b ´ p´1qi`|a| |b|b mi a .

(7.42)

The deformed Leibniz rule (2.8), together with the remaining Eilh-relations (2.7) and the identities (7.29), then imply Q2W " 0 as one can check by direct computation.
In order to define the curvatures of the tensor hierarchy, we symmetrize to an L8algebra using theorem 4.3. We can then use the formalism of section 6.3 to construct an adjusted Weil algebra in the sense of [11], ensuring closure of the gauge algebra without any further constraints on the field strengths.
To illustrate in more detail the procedure and what it achieves, we can perform the coordinate change already at the level of the Weil algebra of the hLie-algebra. This coordinate change yields a symmetrized and firmly adjusted Weil algebra through an evident coordinate change, rA ÞÑ r~A, which removes all appearances of m1 in QWr~A via the deformed

49

Leibniz rule (2.8). Hence, by theorem 3.10 we are left with an L8-algebra. Explicitly, the following coordinate change manifestly removes all appearances of m1:

(7.43)

where da is included as it is needed for QWr~. The corresponding coordinate change on r^A is firmly adjusted by simply first ordering the occurrences of r^B in r^~A to the left (which is permitted by the appearance of only m 0 in r^~A) and then sending m i to m i ` m^ i " 2mi. The choice of left ordering follows from the choice of left Leibniz rule, which is a matter of
convention. Applied to (7.43) this yields

r^a ÞÑ f a :" r^a , r^a ÞÑ ha :" r^a ` 2dabcr^b m0 rc , r^ ÞÑ g :" r^ ´ tabpr^a m0 rb ´ r^b m0 raq , r^a ÞÑ ka :" r^a ` P351c pr^b m0 r ` r^ m0 rbq ` 2tcrbdcsadr^b m0 rc .

(7.44)

Note, this is a special case of the transformation (6.9) for a firm adjustment. The result of this coordinate change is the differential graded commutative algebra

transformations are constructed as infinitesimal partially flat homotopies, cf. e.g. [11] for

details.

To make contact with the expressions in the supergravity literature, cf. [83, 76], one

must make the field redefinitions

(7.50)

Similar field redefinitions were also used in [86] to link another elegant derivation of the

curvature forms (in which, however, the link to higher gauge algebras also is somewhat

obscured) to the supergravity literature. We stress that from the higher gauge algebra point

of view, the form (7.48) is special in the sense that all exterior derivatives of gauge potentials

in non-linear terms have been absorbed in field strengths. This makes (7.48) particularly

useful, as it exposes cleanly the separation of unadjusted curvature and adjustment. From

the former, one can straightforwardly identify the higher Lie algebra of the structure group

of the underlying higher principal bundle. Moreover, gauge transformations are readily

derived from partially flat homotopies, as mentioned above. As a side effect, it is interesting

to note that the arising higher products are at most ternary.

An interesting aspect of (7.48) is the fact that the covariantizations of the differentials

a

(7.51)

at the cost of introducing non-trivial higher products µ3, cf. (4.6). This is fully analogous to the situation in generalized geometry, cf. e.g. the Dorfman and Courant brackets (5.8) and (5.9).

8. Comparison to the literature
We conclude by comparing our results with algebraic structures previously introduced in the literature to capture the gauge structure underlying the higher gauge theories obtained in the tensor hierarchies of gauged supergravity. We shall focus on the particularities of the gauge algebraic structures of the tensor hierarchies; for other work linking the tensor hierarchy to ordinary L8-algebras, see also [87].

8.1. Enhanced Leibniz algebras
A notion of enhanced Leibniz algebras was introduced in [88, 89] to capture the parts of the higher gauge algebraic structures appearing in the tensor hierarchy. See also [79] for a discussion of the higher gauge theory employing these enhanced Leibniz algebras and the link to the tensor hierarchy.

Definition 8.1 ([89]). An enhanced Leibniz algebra is a Leibniz algebra pV, r´, ´sq together

with a vector space W and a linear map t : W Ñ V as well as a binary operation  : VbV Ñ

W such that

A symmetric enhanced Leibniz algebra additionally satisfies the condition that

uv " vu

for all u, v P V.

A symmetric enhanced Leibniz algebra is an hLie-algebra concentrated in degrees ´1 and 0 with a few axioms missing. We can identify the structure maps as follows.

The original definition in [89] of a (not necessarily symmetric) "enhanced Leibniz alge-

bra" is slightly more general, allowing for the operation  to be not symmetric. However,

this is not very natural, as discussed in sections 3.4 and 3.5. Moreover, the algebraic

structure underlying the tensor hierarchy is an hLie-algebra, so enhanced Leibniz algebras

require axiomatic completion.

8.2. 8-Enhanced Leibniz algebras
A similar notion of extended Leibniz algebras was formulated in [90], see also [91] as well as the previous work on Leibniz algebra gauge theories [78].
N Definition 8.2 ([90]). An 8-enhanced Leibniz algebra is an -graded differential complex
pX " `iPNXi, dq with differential of degree ´1, endowed with two binary operations

 : X0 b X0 Ñ X0 , , : Xi b Xj Ñ Xi`j`1 , satisfying the following relations:

(8.4a)

px  yq  z " x  py  zq ´ y  px  zq , a , b " p´1q|a| |b|pb , aq ,
pdwq  x " 0 , dpx , yq " x  y ` y  x , dpu , vq " ´pduq , v ` p´1q|u|`1u , dv , pa , bq , c " p´1q|a|`1a , pb , cq ´ p´1qp|a|`1q|b|b , pa , cq , dpx , py , zqq " px  yq , z ` px  zq , y ´ py  z ` z  yq , x , rdpx , py , zqqsxØy " rpx  yq , u ´ 2x , dpy , uq ´ x , py , duqsxØy ,

(8.4b) (8.4c) (8.4d) (8.4e) (8.4f ) (8.4g) (8.4h) (8.4i)

where x, y, z range over degree 0 elements, w ranges over degree 1 elements, u, v range over positive degree elements, and a, b, c over arbitrary elements of homogeneous degrees, and where r¨ ¨ ¨ sxØy signifies that the enclosed expression is antisymmetrized with respect to the permutation between x and y.

An 8-enhanced Leibniz algebra is a particular type of hLie-algebra with some axioms missing. Clearly, to compare the axioms, we have to invert the sign of the degree. We thus consider an hLie-algebra E concentrated in non-positive degrees with 02 "  non-trivial only on elements of degree 0. Moreover, we are led to identify 12 with with ,; all other i2 are trivial. Then we have the following relations between the axioms of an 8-enhanced Leibniz algebra and an hLie-algebra:
(8.4b) is simply the Leibniz identity and follows from the quadratic relation for 02.
(8.4c) amounts to 12 being graded symmetric and follows from the modified Leibniz rule, as do (8.4d)­(8.4f).
(8.4g) follows from the hLie-axiom for 12  12.

53

(8.4h) follows from the modified Leibniz rule together with the hLie-axioms for 12  02 and 02  12:
1p12px, 12py, zqqq " 02px, 12py, zqq ` 02p12py, zq, xq ´ 12px, 02py, zq ` 02pz, yqq " 12p02px, yq, zq ` 12py, 02px, zqq ´ 12px, 02py, zq ` 02pz, yqq , (8.5)
as does (8.4i): we have:
02p12p´, ´q, ´q " 0 , 1p12px, 12py, uqqq " 12px, 12py, 1puqqq ` 02px, 12py, uqq ´ 12px, 02py, uq ` 02pu, yqq
" 12px, 12py, 1puqqq ` 12p02px, yq, uq ` 12py, 02px, uqq ´ 12px, 02py, uqq ´ 12px, 02pu, yqq ,
12px, 1p12py, uqqq " ´12px, 12py, 1puqqq ` 12px, 02py, uq ` 02pu, yqq , (8.6)
and putting this together, we obtain
"dp12px, 12py, zqqq ` 212px, dp12py, uqqxØy " r´12px, 12py, duqq ` 12p02px, yq, uq ` 12px, 02pu, yqqsxØy . (8.7)
Note, however, that while the hLie-algebra axioms imply the axioms of an 8-enhanced Leibniz algebra, the reverse statement is not true, even for 8-enhanced Leibniz algebras concentrated in degrees 0 and 1. The latter essentially implies that 8-enhanced Leibniz algebras are an incomplete abstraction of the operad Lie and thus do not give the full picture. Altogether, we arrive at the same conclusion as for enhanced Leibniz algebras.
As a side remark, we note that in the outlook of [90], the authors mentioned the desire for the interpretation of 8-enhanced Leibniz algebras as the homotopy algebras of some simpler algebraic structure. Our discussion suggests that this is not possible; instead, the axiomatic completion of 8-enhanced Leibniz algebras yields hLie-algebras whose homotopy algebras form EL8-algebras, a much weaker version of L8-algebras.
8.3. Algebras producing the tensor hierarchies
We now come to larger picture of algebras that lead to the gauge structures visible in the tensor hierarchies, see figure 1. Note that this picture has only been applied in the context of the tensor hierarchy for maximal supersymmetry. We shall be less detailed in the following.
Z In [82], Palmkvist constructs an infinite-dimensional {2-graded Lie algebra, which he
calls the tensor hierarchy algebra, "gLie (THA)" in figure 1. For further work on the tensor
Z hierarchy algebra, see also [93, 94, 95]. As observed in [86], see also [82], this {2-grading Z can be naturally refined into a -grading, and picking an element of degree 1 and subse-
quent restriction induces the structure of a differential graded Lie algebra, "dgLie (THA1)" in figure 1. In [77], Lavau called this differential graded Lie algebra the "tensor hierarchy

algebra" (not to be confused with Palmkvist's larger graded Lie algebra), and derived it from a further algebraic structure called Lie­Leibniz triples, "LieLeibTriple" in figure 1. This differential graded Lie algebra then naturally gives rise to 8-enhanced Leibniz algebras, as described in [92, Section 3]. As explained above, the 8-enhanced Leibniz algebra were an incomplete "guess" of the axioms of an hLie-algebra with i2 " 0 for i  2. Thus, from our perspective, 8-enhanced Leibniz algebras are appropriately replaced by these, and we then have the construction of the gauge L8-algebra via the picture (4.10), which is refined in figure 1. We note that the composition of the arrows "complete axioms" and "antisym.", which produces an L8-algebra from an 8-enhanced Leibniz algebra, is found in [90, Appendix B]. As indicated in figure 1, the direct construction of an L8-algebra from a differential graded Lie algebra is the Fiorenza­Manetti­Getzler construction Proposition 4.4, as pointed out in [92], where Getzler's formulas were specialized to the tensor hierarchy differential graded Lie algebra.
For prior relations amongst tensor hierarchies, the embedding tensor formalism and (homotopy) algebras see also [78, 79]. We again stress that from our point of view, it is not natural to consider gauge theories with infinitesimal symmetries that are not (weaker forms of) Lie algebras. Axiomatically completing the various forms of Leibniz algebras to hLie-algebras solves this issue.
As a side remark, let us note that the fact that Leibniz algebras naturally produce L8-algebras has been pointed out in [96]. This is proposition 4.1 stating that any Leibniz algebra naturally extends to an hLie-algebra combined with theorem 4.3 antisymmetrizing this hLie-algebra to an L8-algebra.

B. Example of an EL8-algebra
Let us give the explicit form of an EL8-algebra E, in which the products 1, 02, 12, and 030 are generic while all other products are trivial. We do not impose any conditions on the underlying differential complex. The compatibility relations are readily computed in the Chevalley­Eilenberg picture, and they read as follows:
