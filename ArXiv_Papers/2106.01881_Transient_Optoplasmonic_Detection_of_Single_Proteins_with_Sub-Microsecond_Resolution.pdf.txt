Optoplasmonic methods capable of single protein detection so far rely on analyte immobilization in order to facilitate detection1­6. These detection schemes, even if they facilitate transient single-molecule detection7,8 via consequent formation and cleavage of chemical bonds, typically exhibit time resolutions on the order of milliseconds. The need for analyte immobilisation is a direct consequence of the minuscule dimensions of plasmonic near fields typically providing sub-attolitre-sized detection volumes which in turn demand sub-microsecond temporal resolution for the direct detection of proteins in motion. Here we show that such temporal resolution can indeed be achieved. We demonstrate the observation of single proteins as small as Hemoglobin (molecular weight: 64 kDa) as they traverse plasmonic near fields of gold nanorods and interact with their surface, all while maintaining signal-to-noise ratios larger than 5 and an unprecedented temporal resolution well below microseconds. This method enables the label-free observation of single-molecule dynamics on previously unaccessible timescales.
In order to achieve such resolution we have improved the confocal system we had previously used to detect single metal nanoparticles in Brownian motion9. Specifically we achieve gains in signalto-noise ratio via optimization of incident and analyzed polarization, probe wavelength and Gouy phase for individual plasmonic gold nanorods. The setup is shown in Fig. 1a and was specifically designed to maintain linear polarization states. For each NR we determine its orientation via rotation of linear incident and analyzer polarisation and obtain its white-light scattering spectra, which allow us to determine whether the overlap of the NRs spectrum with the tuning range of our probe laser (785 ± 20) nm is suited. We then align the incident and analyzer polarisations parallel with the NR's axis and select the wavelength which exhibits the highest slope in the scattering spectra. The detected intensity Idet  |Er|2 + |Es|2 + 2|Er||Es| cos() is a result of the interference between the scattered Es and reflected Er fields projected onto the analyzer's axis and the phase difference between both fields is . NRs with different scattering cross sections require different experimental parameters in order to maximize signal-to-noise. To address this requirement we utilize photothermal spectroscopy10­13 as a convenient probe of an individual NR's sensitivity. This is done by heating the nanorod with the intensity-modulated 532 nm laser (modulation frequency H = 1.3 MHz) while probing it with the intensity-modulated wavelengthtunable probe laser (modulation frequency P = 1 MHz). Heating the NR gives rise to minute changes of the surrounding medium's refractive index which in turn causes the NR's localized surface plasmon resonance (LPSR) to shift. This shift is then detected as a change of IDet at
2

the modulation frequency H . The modulation of the probe beam further enables us to directly

sources. AP T is proportional to the relative change of intensity as a response to the photothermal

refractive index change over the total detected intensity and therefore a direct measure of the

NR's sensitivity, to be optimized by the adjustment of such experiment's parameters as probe

wavelength, probe power and the NR's position in the focal volume. For our measurements we use

nanorods with dimensions of 25 × 80 and 40 × 110 nm and typical LSPR's of 1.6 eV (775 nm).

FIG. 1. Experimental setup with photothermal signal optimization: Panel a shows the optical setup. Panel b shows sections of white-light scattering spectra normalized to the reflection on the glass slide ((s/r)2, green line) and the corresponding relative photothermal amplitude AP T values (blue dots) obtained while varying the tunable laser's wavelength for NRs with various diameters.
For NRs with  40 nm diameter the on-resonance scattering coefficient s = Es/E0, where E0 is the incident field, significantly exceeds the reflection coefficient r = Er/E0 of the glass-water interface and the interference term is therefore negligible. In this case high AP T values are found at a wavelength coinciding with the flanks of the NR's LSPR spectrum i.e. where the slopes of the Lorentzian are highest (see Fig.1 b, left). For the 20 - 25 nm diameter NRs s  r and high
3

AP T values are found closer to the LSPR center (see Fig.1 b, center and right). We find that the interplay between contributions of scattering cross section and phase changes upon heating is more

complex and also dependent on the Gouy phase i.e. the NR's distance to the focal plane. In order

to streamline the alignment process we follow a simple recipe for all NRs: We first center the NR

in the focus (xyz) by maximizing the scattered intensity with crossed polarizers. Then we optimize

AP T with parallel polarizers aligned along the NR's long axis by first tuning the wavelength and then adjusting the NR position along the focal axis (z).

Single-molecule measurements are typically performed by recording intensity time traces of

10 ms length with a sampling rate of 100 MHz. These traces are then de-noised by applying a

running 10-point median filter. Specifically we detect Glucose Oxidase (GOx, molecular weight

 160 kDa) from Aspergillus niger (Fig. 2a) and Hemoglobin (Hem,  64 kDa) from bovine blood

(Fig. 2b) molecules as they move through the NR's near field. These molecules produce transient

shifts of the LSPR, which are recognized as changes of the detected intensity. These changes

appear on the intensity traces as patterns of two different types: 1) Short spike-like perturbations

(comp. Fig. 2a I-1, II-1 left, III-2 and 2b II-1, II-2, III-2) which we interpret as protein molecules

moving directly in and out of the the near-field. 2) Level-transition patterns (comp. Fig. 2a I-1

and III-1 center and Fig. 2b I, III-1 and IV-1) which we think are caused by protein molecules

moving through the aqueous medium into the near field and then dwelling at the NR's surface due

to attractive forces until the attractive potential is eventually overcome and they again move out

of the near field. We also observed a few binding and unbinding events without their respective

counterparts in the same trace. This suggests that sticking lasting longer than 10 ms occurs.

In order to obtain statistics we count fluctuations of intensity traces as events if their amplitudes

exceed 5, where  is the standard deviation of the whole trace. This does not include rare single

step events without counterpart in the same trace (GOx). In the case of (Hem) level transitions

with durations longer than 0.1 ms were excluded from analysis in order to avoid artifacts due to

the low-frequency cut-off (1.5 kHz) of the AC-coupled detector. For each event we determine the

maximum amplitudes Imax and the following temporal properties: rise (fall) the rise (fall) time i.e. the time it takes from the beginning (end) of the event to rise to half the maximum and the

duration between these points i.e. the full duration at half maximum (FDHM).

For both Hem and GOx we find rise- and fall-times in the range from 10 to 1000 ns (see Fig. 3a,

b).

FIG. 3. Statistics of rise and fall times, characterizing the molecular diffusion in the abscence of sticking as well as immediately before and after sticking, for GOx (a) and Hem (b). Each panel (a,b) shows the rise (bottom) and fall (right) distributions alongside their respective 2D-histograms (center). Solid lines (a, light blue and b, dark red) in the distributions show fits to mono-exponential time distributions plotted on logarithmic scale of times.

hydrodynamic radii of 4.45 nm (GOx)14, 3.11 nm (Hem)15 we find rms displacements of  6 nm (GOx) and 8 nm (Hem) which match well with the half decay length of optical near fields. The similarity between rise- and fall-time distributions suggests that entry and the exit processes of both proteins into and out of the NR's sensitive volume are subject to equivalent interactions.
6

The 2D-histograms (Fig. 3a and 3b, center) further show no apparent correlation between rise and fall for individual events further suggesting that entry and exit processes into and out of near field are mutually independent as we would expect for Brownian motion. The rise and fall times for GOx are shorter than the ones we find for Hem although GOx exhibits the higher molecular weight. We speculate that this difference is due to the (in comparison to the globular Hem) more anisotropic shape of GOx16 and may well reflect an additional contribution from rotational diffusion. For GOx we estimate a rotational diffusion time in the order of 50 ns which falls well into our temporal resolution. Differences in the autocorrelation measurements for both molecules further support this hypothesis (see suppl. info. section S1). Nonetheless further work beyond the scope of this manuscript is needed to confirm this. We also find similar FDHMs distributions for both proteins species. These times represent the dwell time of individual proteins in the NR's sensitive volume and are centered around  1 µs and distributed over ranges from 100 ns up to few tens of microseconds i.e. significantly longer than the rise- and fall-times alone (see Fig. 3b). Here the stretch towards long timescales is likely due to attractive interactions between the proteins and the NR's surface, presumably unspecific sticking. The FDHM distribution of Hem (Fig.4 b, bottom) is more stretched towards long times than the one of GOx (Fig.4 a, bottom). Specifically we find that the FDHM distribution for GOx fits well to a mono-exponential decay as expected for a Langmuir adsorption process governed by a single time constant for which we find  = 0.9 µs from the respective fit. For Hem this is not the case as the single rate fit clearly deviates from the data (not shown). This suggests contributions from multiple processes with different rates. Already for two rates (1 = 0.83 µs and 2 = 4.8 µs) we find a much better match. This is rather unsurprising due to the larger set of fitting parameters. We think it is more likely that a broader spectrum of rates exists rather than just two. The maximum amplitude vs. FDHM distribution for Hem (Fig.4 b, center) also reveals a stronger correlation between larger amplitudes and longer times as compared with GOx (Fig. 4a, center). We hypothesize the differences between Hem and GOx, specifically the existence of multiple rate constants could arise due to the following reasons: 1) Hemoglobin exhibits surface areas which possess different affinity to gold and therefore shows different sticking dynamics dependent on the protein's contact area with the surface. The correlation of high amplitudes with long FDHMs would then arise due to increased overlap between protein sections with high polarizability (i.e. Hem's iron-complex) and the NR's near field. 2) Hemoglobin has different affinities to different types of gold crystal facets. In this case the correlation of higher maximum amplitudes with longer FDHMs would imply that facets which offer higher affinities coincide with zones of higher near-field intensity. Which

hypothesis is right or whether there is a process we have not covered will require further study beyond the scope of this work. We want to point out that GOx and Hem measurements shown here (Fig.2, 3 and 4) were performed with different detectors, i.e., the amplitude values given are not directly comparable. To obtain a direct comparison of perturbation amplitudes we determine the
8

relative intensity changes Irel =

Imax Idet

caused by GOx and Hem from measurements performed

with the same DC-coupled detector. We find average values of Irel = (3.4 ± 1.5)% for GOx and

(1.55 ± 0.45)% for Hem. The ratio Irel(GOx)/Irel(Hem) = 2.2 ± 1 matches the corresponding

molecular weight ratio of 2.5 within the errors. We would also like to put our time resolution into

context: None of the events discussed above - even the longest (FDHM 100 µs), would be resolved

with other state-of-the-art nanoplasmonic assays1­8,17­20, which typically exhibit time resolutions

in the order of milliseconds, i.e., see the whole extent of the traces displayed in Fig. 2a(top) and

2b(top) as either a single or a set of few points. We think being able to resolve and analyse such

short unspecific interactions opens up a whole new pathway for fast molecular fingerprinting. We

envision that previously not resolvable differences in the interaction dynamics between specific

proteins sub-domains and small weakly bonding receptor molecules on the NR's surface may be

used as means to distinguish between proteins of similar mass. In the simplest case the average

number of formed bonds determines the dwell time. This would further allow to gain structural

information on analytes, especially unknown ones therefore mitigating the need for target-specific

receptors. In addition physical analyte properties such as Stokes radii and molecular weight may be

determined via rise, fall and relative amplitudes following NR calibration with a suited standard.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the transient detection of single proteins with masses as low as

64 kDa traversing the subattoliter volumes spanned by plasmonic near fields during times as short

as 100 ns and with a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 5. We found good agreement between relative

signal amplitudes and molecular weights. We have used our unprecedented temporal resolution to

observe protein motion alongside the dynamics of unspecific protein surface interactions. We found

distinctive differences in sticking behaviors of Glucose Oxidase and Hemoglobin and found initial

evidence that suggests that our method may resolve rotational diffusion. We think this result

offers but a glimpse of the additional information that may be gained on physical and biochemical

processes on the timescales now made accessible by fast optoplasmonic detection.

S1: AUTOCORRELATION MEASUREMENTS

Here we show intensity autocorrelations measured for Hemoglobin and Glucose Oxidase. Au-

tocorrelations were computed from intensity traces with 10 ms durations and time resolution of

10 ns following the procedures used in our previous work1. Results are averaged over 50 consecu-

tively recorded traces and shown in figure S1. For Glucose Oxidase we find strong correlations on

timescales shorter than 100 ns, whereas no such correlations are present for Hemoglobin. Glucose

Oxidase presents the shape of two cylinders co-joined orthogonal to the cylinder axis and therefore

possess a higher asymmetry then the globular Hemoglobin. Therefore we think it is likely that

the difference between the autocorrelation is due to rotational diffusion. This hypothesis is further

supported as we find good agreement between the observed correlation times < 100 ns and the

rotational diffusion times D of 28 to 129 ns expected for a sphere with the dimensions of Glucose oxidase, i.e. radii of 3 to 5 nm. Calculations were performed using the relation D = (6D)-1

whereas the rotational diffusion constant D was determined via the Debye-Stokes-Einstein rela-
