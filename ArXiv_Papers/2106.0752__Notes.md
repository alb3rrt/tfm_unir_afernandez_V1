## Abstract

We revisit the electromagnetic form factors of the proton and neutron in the holographic soft wall model. At low momentum transfer, we show that by matching the nucleon and rho Regge slopes and fixing the nucleon anomalous dimension by the nucleon mass, a perfect match to the world average charge radii from e-p scattering (including the recent small charge radius of the proton measured by the PRad collaboration at JLab) follows. At high momentum transfer, the nucleon anomalous dimension runs up to match the hard scaling rule.
