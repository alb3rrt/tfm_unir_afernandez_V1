## Abstract

This study uses an innovative measure, the Semantic Brand Score, to assess the interest of stakeholders in different company core values. Among others, we focus on corporate social responsibility (CSR) core value statements, and on the attention they receive from five categories of stakeholders (customers, company communication teams, employees, associations and media). Combining big data methods and tools of Social Network Analysis and Text Mining, we analyzed about 58,000 Italian tweets and found that different stakeholders have different prevailing interests. CSR gets much less attention than expected. Core values related to customers and employees are in the foreground.
