## Abstract

We use blow up analysis for local integral equations to provide a blow up rates of solutions of higher order Hardy-Henon equation in a bounded domain with an isolated singularity, and show the asymptotic radial symmetry of the solutions near the singularity. This work generalizes the correspondence results of Jin-Xiong [8] on higher order conformally invariant equations with an isolated singularity.
