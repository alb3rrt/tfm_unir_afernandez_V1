## Abstract

Consider actions of $\Z ^r$ by ergodic automorphisms on a compact nilmanifolds for $r \geq 2$. We show that small $C^k$ perturbations of such higher rank partially hyperbolic actions are smoothly conjugate to the original action, using a KAM scheme. The driving force for convergence of this iteration is the exponential mixing of the original action.
