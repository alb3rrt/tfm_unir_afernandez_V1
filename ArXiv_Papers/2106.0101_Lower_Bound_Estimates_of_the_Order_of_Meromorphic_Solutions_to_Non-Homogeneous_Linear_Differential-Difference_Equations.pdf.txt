Abstract. In this article, we deal with the order of growth of solutions of non-homogeneous linear differential-difference equation
nm
Aijf (j)(z + ci) = F (z),
i=0 j=0
where Aij, F (z) are entire or meromorphic functions and ci (0, 1, ..., n) are non-zero distinct complex numbers. Under the sufficient condition that there exists one coefficient having the maximal lower order or having the maximal lower type strictly greater than the order or the type of other coefficients, we obtain estimates of the lower bound of the order of meromorphic solutions of the above equation.

1 Introduction and statement of main results
Throughout this article, a meromorphic function means a function that is meromorphic in the whole complex plane C. We use the basic notations such as m (r, f ) , N (r, f ) , T (r, f ) and fundamental results of Nevanlinna's

value distribution theory ([8, 12, 24]). Further, we denote respectively by (f ), µ(f ),  (f ), (f ), the order, the lower order, the type and the lower type of a meromorphic function f , also when f is an entire function, we use the notations M (f ) ,  M (f ) respectively for the type and lower type of f (see e.g. [8, 12, 14, 24]).
Recently, a lot of results were rapidly obtained for complex difference and complex difference equations ([1 - 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 15 - 17, 19, 25, 26]). The back-ground for these studies lies in the recent difference counterparts of Nevanlinna theory. The key result here is the difference analogue of the lemma on the logarithmic derivative obtained by Halburd-Korhonen [10, 11] and Chiang-Feng [7], independently. Several authors have investigated the properties of meromorphic solutions of complex linear difference equation
Anf (z + cn) + An-1f (z + cn-1) + · · · + A1f (z + c1) + A0f (z) = An+1, (1.1)
where Aj(z) (j = 0, ..., n + 1) are entire or meromorphic functions and ci (1, ..., n) are non-zero distinct complex numbers, when one coefficient has maximal order (lower order) or among coefficients having the maximal order (lower order), exactly one has its type (lower type) strictly greater than others and achieved some important results (see e.g. [2, 7, 15, 19, 25]). Very recently in [2], the authors have studied the growth of meromorphic solutions of (1.1) when one coefficient having maximal lower order or having the maximal lower type stricly greater than the order or the type of other coefficients, we have obtained the following theorems.
Theorem A ([2]) Let Aj(z) (j = 0, ..., n + 1) be entire functions, and let k, l  {0, 1, ..., n + 1}. If the following three assumptions hold simultaneously:
(1) max{µ(Ak), (Aj), j = k, l} =   µ(Al) < , µ(Al) > 0;
(2)  M (Al) >  M (Ak), when µ(Al) = µ(Ak);
(3) max{M (Aj) : (Aj) = µ(Al), j = k, l} = 1 <  M (Al), when µ(Al) = max{(Aj), j = k, l}.
Then every meromorphic solution f of (1.1) satisfies (f )  µ(Al) if An+1  0. Furthermore, if An+1(z)  0, then every meromorphic solution f  0 of (1.1) satisfies (f )  µ(Al) + 1.

Theorem B ([2]) Let Aj(z) (j = 0, ..., n + 1) be meromorphic functions, and let k, l  {0, 1, ..., n + 1}. If the following five assumptions hold simultaneously :

(1) max{µ(Ak), (Aj), j = k, l} =   µ(Al) < ; (2)  (Al) >  (Ak), when µ(Al) = µ(Ak);

(3)

1 =

 (Aj) <  (Al) < +

(Aj )=µ(Al), j=l,k

when µ(Al) = max{(Aj), j = l, k};

(4) 1 +  (Ak) <  (Al) < +
when µ(Al) = µ (Ak) = max{(Aj), j = k, l};

(5) 

1 Al

< µ(Al) < .

Then every meromorphic solution f of (1.1) satisfies (f )  µ(Al) if An+1  0. Furthermore, if An+1(z)  0, then every meromorphic solution f  0 of (1.1) satisfies (f )  µ(Al) + 1.

Historically, the study of complex differential-difference equations can be traced back to Naftalevich's research. By making use of operator theory and iteration method, Naftalevich [20] considered the meromorphic solutions on complex differential-difference equations. However, there are few investigations on complex differential-difference field using Nevanlinna theory. Recently, some papers (see, [6, 18, 21, 22, 26]) focusing on complex differentialdifference emerged. In [6] , Chen and Zheng have investigated the growth of solutions of the homogeneous differential-difference equation

and obtained the following results.

Theorem C ([6]) Let Aij (z) (i = 0, ..., n; j = 0, ..., m) be entire functions, and a, l  {0, 1, ..., n}, b  {0, 1, ..., m} such that (a, b) = (l, 0). If the follow-
ing three assumptions hold simultaneously :
(1) max{µ(Aab), (Aij), (i, j) = (a, b), (l, 0)} =   µ(Al0) < , µ(Al0) > 0; (2)  M (Al0) >  M (Aab), when µ(Al0) = µ(Aab); (3)  M (Al0) > max{M (Aij) : (Aij) = µ(Al0), (i, j) = (a, b), (l, 0)}, when µ(Al0) = max{(Aij) : (i, j) = (a, b), (l, 0)}. Then any non zero meromorphic solution f of (1.2) satisfies (f )  µ(Al0) + 1.

Theorem D ([6]) Let Aij (z) (i = 0, ..., n; j = 0, ..., m) be meromorphic func-

tions, and a, l  {0, 1, ..., n}, b  {0, 1, ..., m} such that (a, b) = (l, 0) . If the

following four assumptions hold simultaneously:

(2) max{µ(Aab), (Aij), (i, j) = (a, b), (l, 0)} =   µ(Al0) < , µ(Al0) > 0;

(4)  (Al0) > max{ (Aij) : (Aij) = µ(Al0), (i, j) = (a, b), (l, 0)} when µ(Al0) = max{(Aij) : (i, j) = (a, b), (l, 0)}. Then any non zero mero-

morphic solution f of (1.2) satisfies (f )  µ(Al0) + 1.

In this paper, by combining complex differential and difference equations, we extend the results of Theorems C and D for the complex nonhomogeneous linear differential-difference equation

(1.3)

The main results of this paper state as follows.

Theorem 1.1 Let Aij(z)(i = 0, ..., n; j = 0, ..., m), F (z) be entire functions, and let k, p (0  k  n, 0  p  m) be integers. If there exists an integer l (0  l  n), such that Al0 satisfies the following three assumptions simultaneously :

(1) max{µ(Akp), (F ), (Aij), (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)} =   µ(Al0) < , µ(Al0) > 0;
(2)  M (Al0) >  M (Akp), when µ(Al0) = µ(Akp);

(3) max{M (S) : (S) = µ(Al0), S  {F, Aij : (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)}} = 1 <  M (Al0), when µ(Al0) = max{(F ), (Aij), (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)}.
Then every meromorphic solution f of (1.3) satisfies (f )  µ(Al0) if F (z)  0. Further, if F (z)  0, then every meromorphic solution f  0 of (1.2) satisfies (f )  µ(Al0) + 1.

Theorem 1.2 Let Aij(z)(i = 0, ..., n; j = 0, ..., m), F (z) be meromorphic functions, and let k, p (0  k  n, 0  p  m) be integers. If there exists an integer l(0  l  n), such that Al0 satisfies the following five assumptions simultaneously :

(1) max{µ(Akp), (F ), (Aij), (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)} =   µ(Al0) < ; (2)  (Al0) >  (Akp), when µ(Al0) = µ(Akp);

(3)

(Aij )=µ(Al0), (i,j)=(l,0),(k,p)

when µ(Al0) = max{(F ), (Aij), (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)};

when µ(Al0) = µ (Akp) = max{(F ), (Aij), (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)};

(5)

Then every meromorphic solution f of (1.3) satisfies (f )  µ(Al0) if F (z)  0. Further, if F (z)  0, then every meromorphic solution f  0 of (1.2) satisfies (f )  µ(Al0) + 1.

2 Some Preliminary Lemmas
Lemma 2.1 ([9]) Let f be a transcendental meromorphic function of finite order (f ), and let k and j be integers satisfying k > j  0. Then for any

given (> 0), there exists a subset E1  (1, +) which has finite logarithmic measure such that for all z satisfying |z| = r / [0, 1]  E1, we have

f (k)(z) f (j)(z)

 |z|(k-j)((f)-1+).

Lemma 2.2 ([7]) Let f be a meromorphic function of finite order , and let c1, c2(c1 = c2) be two arbitrary complex numbers. Let  > 0 be given, then there exists a subset E2  (1, +) with finite logarithmic measure such that for all z satisfying |z| = r / [0, 1]  E2, we have
exp{-r-1+}  f (z + c1)  exp{r-1+}. f (z + c2)
Lemma 2.3 ([8]) Let f be a meromorphic function, c be a non-zero complex constant. Then we have that for r - +

(1 + o(1))T (r - |c|, f (z))  T (r, f (z + c))  (1 + o(1))T (r + |c|, f (z)).

Consequently

(f (z + c)) = (f ), µ(f (z + c)) = µ(f ).

Lemma 2.4 ([4]) Let f be a meromorphic function of finite order . Then for any given  > 0, there exists a set E3  (1, +) having finite linear measure and finite logarithmic measure such that for all z satisfying |z| = r / [0, 1]  E3 and sufficiently large r, we have
exp{-r+}  |f (z)|  exp{r+}.

Lemma 2.5 ([13]) Let f be an entire function with µ(f ) < . Then for any given (> 0), there exists a subset E4  (1, +) with infinite logarithmic measure such that for all r  E4, we have

µ(f )

rE4

and M (r, f ) < exp{rµ(f)+}.

Lemma 2.6 ([23]) Let f be an entire function with 0 < µ(f ) < . Then for any given (> 0), there exists a subset E5  (1, +) with infinite logarithmic measure such that for all r  E5, we have



M

and M (r, f ) < exp{( M (f ) + )rµ(f)}.
Lemma 2.7 ([7]) Let f be a meromorphic function of finite order (f ) < , and let c1, c2 be two distinct complex numbers. Then for each  > 0, we have

m

r,

f f

(z (z

= O(r(f)-1+).

Lemma 2.8 ([12]) (Logarithmic Derivative Lemma) Let f be a meromorphic function and k  1 be an integer. Then, we have

m

f (k) f

= O (log T (r, f ) + log r)

possibly outside a set E6  [0, +) of a finite linear measure. If (f ) < ,

then

f (k) f

= O (log r) .

Lemma 2.9 ([25]) Let f be a meromorphic function with µ(f ) < . Then for any given (> 0), there exists a subset E7  (1, +) with infinite logarithmic measure such that for all r  E7, we have

T (r, f ) < rµ(f)+.

Lemma 2.10 ([19]) Let f be a meromorphic function with 0 < µ(f ) < . Then for any given (> 0), there exists a subset E8  (1, +) with infinite logarithmic measure such that for all r  E8, we have
T (r, f ) < ( (f ) + )rµ(f).

3 Proof of main results

Proof of Theorem 1.1 If f has infinite order, then the result holds. Now, we suppose that (f ) < . We divide (1.3) by f (z + cl) to get

(3.2)

From Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 2.3, for any given (> 0), there exists a subset E1  (1, +) which has finite logarithmic measure such that for all z satisfying |z| = r / [0, 1]  E1, we have

f (j)(z + ci) f (z + ci)

 |z|j((f+ci)-1+) = |z|j((f)-1+), (i, j) = (l, 0).

(3.3)

It follows by Lemma 2.2 that for any (> 0), there exists a subset E2  (1, +) with finite logarithmic measure such that for all z satisfying |z| = r / [0, 1]  E2, we have

f (z + ci) f (z + cl)

 exp{r(f)-1+},

From Lemma 2.3, we get

i = l.

(3.4)

(f (z + cl)) = 

1 f (z + cl)

= (f ).

So, by Lemma 2.4, for any given  > 0, there exists a subset E3  (1, +) having finite linear measure and finite logarithmic measure such that for all z satisfying |z| = r / [0, 1]  E3 sufficiently large, we have

1 f (z + cl)

 exp{r(f)+}.

(3.5)

In the following, we divide the proof into four cases:

Case (i) . We suppose that  < µ(Al0).

For S  {F, Aij : (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)} , by the definition of (S), for any given  > 0 and sufficiently large r, we have

|S (z)|  exp{r(S)+}  exp{r+}.

(3.6)

It follows by the definition of µ(Al0), for sufficiently small  > 0 and sufficiently large r, we have

|Al0 (z)|  exp{rµ(Al0)-}.

(3.7)

It also follows by the definition of µ(Akp) and Lemma 2.5, for any given (> 0), there exists a subset E4  (1, +) with infinite logarithmic measure such that for all r  E4, we have

|Akp (z)|  exp{rµ(Akp)+}.

(3.8)

By substituting (3.3) - (3.8) into (3.2) , for all z satisfying |z| = r  E4 \ ([0, 1]  E1  E2  E3), we obtain

n
exp{rµ(Al0)-}

m
+ exp{r+}|z|j((f)-1+) + exp{r+} exp{r(f)+}.

 ((n - 1)(m + 1) + 2m) rm((f)-1+) exp{r+} exp{r(f)-1+} + rp((f)-1+) exp{rµ(Akp)+} exp{r(f)-1+} + exp{r+} exp{r(f)+}. (3.9) Now, we may choose sufficiently small  satisfying 0 < 3 < µ(Al0) - , we deduce from (3.9) that for |z| = r  E4 \ ([0, 1]  E1  E2  E3), r  +
exp{rµ(Al0)-2}  exp{r(f)+}.
Therefore, µ(Al0)  (f ) + 3, since  > 0 is arbitrary, then (f )  µ(Al0).

Further, if F  0, then by substituting (3.3), (3.4) and (3.6) - (3.8) into (3.2) , for all z satisfying |z| = r  E4 \ ([0, 1]  E1  E2), we obtain
exp{rµ(Al0)-}  (nm + n + m - 1) rm((f)-1+) exp{r+} exp{r(f)-1+}

+ rp((f)-1+) exp{rµ(Akp)+} exp{r(f)-1+}.

(3.10)

By choosing sufficiently small  satisfying 0 < 3 < µ(Al0) - , we deduce from (3.10) that for |z| = r  E4 \ ([0, 1]  E1  E2), r  +

exp{rµ(Al0)-2}  exp{r(f)-1+},

that is, µ(Al0)  (f )-1+3, since  > 0 is arbitrary, then (f )  µ(Al0)+1. Case (ii) We suppose that  = max{(F ), (Aij), (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)} < µ(Al0) = µ(Akp),  M (Al0) >  M (Akp).

For S  {F, Aij : (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)} , by the definition of (S), for any given (> 0), and sufficiently large r, we have

|S (z)|  exp{r(S)+}  exp{r+}.

(3.11)

From the definition of  M (Al0), for sufficiently small  > 0 and sufficiently large r, we have

|Al0 (z)|  exp{( M (Al0) - ) rµ(Al0)}.

(3.12)

Also, from the definition of  M (Akp) and Lemma 2.6, for any given (> 0), there exists a subset E5  (1, +) with infinite logarithmic measure such
that for all r  E5, we have

|Akp (z)|  exp{( M (Akp) + ) rµ(Akp)} = exp{( M (Akp) + ) rµ(Al0)}. (3.13)

10

By substituting (3.3) - (3.5) and (3.11) - (3.13) into (3.2), for all z satisfying |z| = r  E5 \ ([0, 1]  E1  E2  E3), we get
exp{( M (Al0) - )rµ(Al0)}
 (nm + n + m - 1) rm((f)-1+) exp{r+} exp{r(f)-1+} +rp((f)-1+) exp{( M (Akp)+)rµ(Al0)} exp{r(f)-1+}+exp{r+} exp{r(f)+}.
(3.14) Therefore, we may choose sufficiently small , 0 < 2 < min{µ(Al0) - ,  M (Al0) -  M (Akp)}, then from (3.14) for r  E5 \ ([0, 1]  E1  E2  E3) sufficiently large, we obtain
exp{( M (Al0) -  M (Akp) - 2)rµ(Al0)-}  exp{r(f)+}.
Then, µ(Al0)  (f ) + 2, since  > 0 is arbitrary, so (f )  µ(Al0).

Further, if F  0, then by substituting (3.3), (3.4) and (3.11) - (3.13) into (3.2), for all z satisfying |z| = r  E5 \ ([0, 1]  E1  E2), we have

exp{( M (Al0) - )rµ(Al0)}

 (nm + n + m - 1) rm((f)-1+) exp{r+} exp{r(f)-1+}

+ rp((f)-1+) exp{( M (Akp) + )rµ(Al0)} exp{r(f)-1+}.

(3.15)

Now, we may choose sufficiently small , 0 < 2 < min{µ(Al0)-,  M (Al0)-  M (Akp)}, then from (3.15) for r  E5 \ ([0, 1]  E1  E2) sufficiently large, we get

exp{( M (Al0) -  M (Akp) - 2)rµ(Al0)-}  exp{r(f)-1+},

that is, µ(Al0)  (f )-1+2, since  > 0 is arbitrary, then (f )  µ(Al0)+1.

Case (iii) When µ(Al0) = max{(F ), (Aij), (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)} > µ(Akp), and max{M (S) : (S) = µ(Al0), S  {F, Aij : (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)}} = 1 <  M (Al0).

For S  {F, Aij : (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)} , by the definitions of (S) and M (S), for any given  > 0 and sufficiently large r, we have

|S (z)| 

exp{r(S)+}  exp{rµ(Al0)-}, if (S) < µ(Al0), exp{(1 + ) rµ(Al0)}, if (S) = µ(Al0).

(3.16)

11

Then, by substituting (3.3) - (3.5) , (3.8) , (3.12) and (3.16) into (3.2), for all z satisfying |z| = r  E4 \ ([0, 1]  E1  E2  E3) sufficiently large, we obtain
exp{( M (Al0) - ) rµ(Al0)}  O rm((f)-1+) exp{(1 + ) rµ(Al0)} exp r(f)-1+
+O rm((f)-1+) exp{rµ(Al0)-} exp r(f)-1+ +rp((f)-1+) exp{rµ(Akp)+} exp r(f)-1+ +O rm((f)-1+) exp{rµ(Al0)-}
+ O rm((f)-1+) exp (1 + ) rµ(Al0) + exp{(1 + ) rµ(Al0)} exp r(f)+ . (3.17)
Now, we may choose sufficiently small  satisfying
0 < 2 < min{µ(Al0) - µ(Akp),  M (Al0) - 1},
then from (3.17) for sufficiently large r  E4 \ ([0, 1]  E1  E2  E3), we get
exp{( M (Al0) - 1 - 2) rµ(Al0)-}  exp r(f)+ .
That means, µ(Al0)  (f ) + 2, since  > 0 is arbitrary, then (f )  µ(Al0).
Further, if F  0, then by substituting (3.3) , (3.4) , (3.8) , (3.12) and (3.16) into (3.2), for all z satisfying |z| = r  E4 \ ([0, 1]  E1  E2) sufficiently large, we have
exp{( M (Al0) - ) rµ(Al0)}  O rm((f)-1+) exp{(1 + ) rµ(Al0)} exp r(f)-1+
+O rm((f)-1+) exp{rµ(Al0)-} exp r(f)-1+ +rp((f)-1+) exp{rµ(Akp)+} exp r(f)-1+
+ O rm((f)-1+) exp{rµ(Al0)-} + O rm((f)-1+) exp (1 + ) rµ(Al0) . (3.18)
Now, we may choose sufficiently small  satisfying
0 < 2 < min{µ(Al0) - µ(Akp),  M (Al0) - 1},
then from (3.18) for sufficiently large r  E4 \ ([0, 1]  E1  E2), we get
exp{( M (Al0) - 1 - 2) rµ(Al0)-}  exp r(f)-1+ .
12

That means, µ(Al0)  (f ) - 1 + 2, since  > 0 is arbitrary, then (f )  µ(Al0) + 1.

Case (iv) We suppose that max{(Aij), (F ), (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)} = µ(Akp) =
µ(Al0) and max{ M (Akp), M (S) : (S) = µ(Al0), S  {F, Aij : (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)}} = 2 <  M (Al0).

It follows by substituting (3.3) - (3.5) , (3.12) , (3.13) and (3.16) into (3.2), for all z satisfying |z| = r  E5 \ ([0, 1]  E1  E2  E3) sufficiently large, we have
exp{( M (Al0) - ) rµ(Al0)}
 O rm((f)-1+) exp{(2 + ) rµ(Al0)} exp r(f)-1+

+ exp{(2 + ) rµ(Al0)} exp r(f)+ .

(3.19)

Now, we may choose sufficiently small  satisfying

0 < 2 <  M (Al0) - 2, from (3.19) for sufficiently large r  E5 \ ([0, 1]  E1  E2  E3), we get
exp{( M (Al0) - 2 - 2) rµ(Al0)-}  exp r(f)+ , that means, µ(Al0)  (f ) + 2, since  > 0 is arbitrary, then (f )  µ(Al0).

Further, if F  0, by substituting (3.3) , (3.4) , (3.12) , (3.13) and (3.16) into (3.2), for all z satisfying |z| = r  E5 \ ([0, 1]  E1  E2) sufficiently large, we have

Now, we may choose sufficiently small  satisfying

0 < 2 <  M (Al0) - 2,
from (3.20) for sufficiently large r  E5 \ ([0, 1]  E1  E2), we get exp{( M (Al0) - 2 - 2) rµ(Al0)-}  exp r(f)-1+ .
That means, µ(Al0)  (f ) - 1 + 2, since  > 0 is arbitrary, then (f )  µ(Al0) + 1. The proof of Theorem 1.1 is complete.

Proof of Theorem 1.2 If f has infinite order, then the result holds. Now, we suppose that (f ) < . By (3.1) , we have

In the following, we divide the proof into four cases:

Case (i) We suppose that  < µ(Al0). For S  {F, Aij : (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)}, from the definition of (S) and (f ) for any given  > 0 and sufficiently large r, we have

T (r, S)  r(S)+  r+,

(3.25)

T (r, f )  r(f)+.

(3.26)

It follows from the definition of µ(Al0), for sufficiently small  > 0 and sufficiently large r, we have

T (r, Al0)  rµ(Al0)-.

(3.27)

It follows from the definition of µ(Akp) and Lemma 2.9, for any given (> 0), there exists a subset E7  (1, +) with infinite logarithmic measure such that for all r  E7, we have

T (r, Akp)  rµ(Akp)+.

(3.28)

By substituting (3.22) - (3.28) into (3.21) for sufficiently large r  E7\E6, we obtain

rµ(Al0)-  ((n - 1)(m + 1) + 2m) r+ + rµ(Akp)+ + O(r(f)-1+)

+ 2 (2r)(f)+ + r+ + r

+ + O(log r).

We may choose sufficiently small  satisfying

(3.29)

0 < 3 < min

it follows from (3.29) that for r  E7\E6, r  +

rµ(Al0)-2  r(f)+,

that means, µ(Al0)  (f ) + 3, since  > 0 is arbitrary, then (f )  µ(Al0). Further, if F  0, then by substituting (3.22) - (3.25), (3.27) and (3.28) into (3.21) for sufficiently large r  E7\E6, we obtain
rµ(Al0)-  ((n - 1)(m + 1) + 2m) r+ + rµ(Akp)+ + O(r(f)-1+)

+ + O(log r).

We may choose sufficiently small  satisfying

(3.30)

0 < 3 < min

,

from (3.30) that for r  E7\E6, r  +

rµ(Al0)-2  r(f )-1+,

that means, µ(Al0)  (f ) - 1 + 3, since  > 0 is arbitrary, then (f )  µ(Al0) + 1.

Case (ii) We suppose that max{(Aij), (F ), (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)} =  < µ(Al0) = µ(Akp),  (Al0) >  (Akp).

For S  {F, Aij : (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)} , by the definition of (S), for any given (> 0) and sufficiently large r, we obtain

T (r, S)  r(S)+  r+.

(3.31)

From the definition of  (Al0), for sufficiently small  > 0 and sufficiently

large r, we have

T (r, Al0)  ( (Al0) - ) rµ(Al0).

(3.32)

It follows from the definition of  (Akp) and Lemma 2.10, for any given (> 0), there exists a subset E8  (1, +) with infinite logarithmic measure such that for all r  E8, we have

T (r, Akp)  ( (Akp) + ) rµ(Akp)  ( (Akp) + ) rµ(Al0).

(3.33)

By substituting (3.22) - (3.24) , (3.26) and (3.31) - (3.33) into (3.21) , for sufficiently large r  E8\E6, we obtain

( (Al0) - ) rµ(Al0)  ((n - 1)(m + 1) + 2m) r+ + ( (Akp) + ) rµ(Al0)

Now, we may choose sufficiently small  satisfying

(3.34)

0 < 2 < min

µ(Al0) - ,  (Al0) -  (Akp), µ(Al0) -

,

17

so from (3.34) for sufficiently large r  E8\E6, we have ( (Al0) -  (Akp) - 2)rµ(Al0)-  r(f)+,

that means, µ(Al0)  (f ) + 2, since  > 0 is arbitrary, then (f )  µ(Al0). Further, if F  0, then by substituting (3.22) - (3.24) and (3.31) - (3.33) into (3.21) , for sufficiently large r  E8\E6, we obtain
( (Al0) - ) rµ(Al0)  ((n - 1)(m + 1) + 2m) r+ + ( (Akp) + ) rµ(Al0)

+ O(r(f)-1+) + r

1 Al0

Now, we may choose sufficiently small  satisfying

(3.35)

0 < 2 < min

µ(Al0) - ,  (Al0) -  (Akp), µ(Al0) - 

1 Al0

.

From (3.35) for sufficiently large r  E8\E6, we get

( (Al0) -  (Akp) - 2)rµ(Al0)-  r(f)-1+,

that means, µ(Al0)  (f ) - 1 + 2, since  > 0 is arbitrary, then (f ) 

µ(Al0) + 1.

Case (iii) We suppose that µ(Al0) = max{(F ), (Aij) : (i, j) = (l, 0), (k, p)} >

µ(Akp), and 1 = (Aij )=µ(Al0), (i,j)=(l,0),(k,p)  (Aij ) +  (F ) <  (Al0). Then, there exists a subset J  {0, 1, . . . , n} × {0, 1, . . . , m}\ {(l, 0), (k, p)} such

that for all (i, j)  J, when (Aij) = µ (Al0) , we have

 (Aij) <  (Al0)-

(i,j)J

 (F ), and for (i, j)   = {0, 1, . . . , n} × {0, 1, . . . , m}\ (J  { (l, 0), (k, p)})

we have  (Aij) < µ (Al0) . Hence, for any given  > 0 and sufficiently large r, we get

T (r, Aij) 

( (Aij) + ) rµ(Al0), if (i, j)  J, r(Aij)+  rµ(Al0)-, if (i, j)  

(3.36)

and

T (r, F ) 

( (F ) + ) rµ(Al0), if (F ) = µ(Al0), r(F )+  rµ(Al0)-, if (F ) < µ(Al0).

(3.37)

Then, by substituting (3.22)-(3.24) , (3.26) , (3.28) , (3.32) , (3.36) and (3.37) into (3.21), for all z satisfying |z| = r  E7\E6 sufficiently large r, we obtain

Further, if F  0, then by substituting (3.22) - (3.24) , (3.28) , (3.32) and (3.36) into (3.21), for all z satisfying |z| = r  E7\E6 sufficiently large r, we obtain

function

It is easy to see that the conditions of Theorem 1.2 are verified. The mero-

morphic function
