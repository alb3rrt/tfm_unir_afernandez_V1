1 Introduction

In this paper, we consider the following initial value problem for the higher dimensional Camassa-

Holm equations:

  tm + u · m + uT · m + (divu)m = 0,



m = (1 - u(0, x) =

)u, u0,

(t, x)  R+ × Rd, (t, x)  R+ × Rd, x  Rd.

(1.1)

According to [44], we can transform Eq. (1.1) into the following form of transport equations:

tu + u · u = Q(u, u) + R(u, u),

(1.2)

where

Q(u, u) = -(I - )-1div

Eq. (1.1) was investigated as Euler-Poincar´e equations describes geodesic motion on the diffeomorphism group with respect to the kinetic energy norm in [29], which can also be viewed as higher dimensional generalization of the following classical one dimensional Camassa-holm equation (CH):

mt + umx + 2uxm = 0, m = u - uxx.

The CH equation is completely integrable [8, 17] and has a bi-Hamiltonian structure [7, 24]. It also

has the solitary waves and peak solitons [18,21]. It is worth mentioning that the peakons show the

characteristic for the traveling waves of greatest height and arise as solutions to the free-boundary

problem for the incompressible Euler equations over a flat bed, see [10, 11, 15, 42]. The local well-

posedness, global strong solutions, blow-up strong solutions of the CH equations were studied

in [9, 12­14, 22, 35, 41]. The global weak solutions, global conservative solutions and dissipative

solutions also have been investigated in [2, 3, 20, 31, 43]. For the continuity of the solutions map of

the CH equations with respect to the initial data, it was only proved in the spaces C([0, T ]; Bps,r(R))

for

any

s

<

s

with

s

>

max{

3 2

,

1

+

1 p

}

by

many

authors.

Moreover,

Li

and

Yin

in

[40]

proved

that

the index of the continuous dependence for the solutions to the Camassa-Holm type equations in

Bps,r (R)

s

>

max{

,

+

1 p

}

can up to s, which improved many authors' results, especially the

Danchin's results in [22, 23]. Recently, Guo et al. [25] obtained the local ill-posedness for a class of

shallow water wave equations (such as, the CH, DP, Novikov equations and etc.) in critical Sobolev

space

H

3 2

(R)

and

even

in

Besov

space

1+
Bp,r

1 p

(R)

with

p



[1, +],

r

 (1, +].

More recently,

by use of the compactness argument and Lagrangian coordinate transformatiorather rather than

the usual techniques used in [40], Ye et al. [45] proved the CH equation is locally well-posed and

continuous

dependence

in

Besov

spaces

1+
Bp,1

(R)

with

p



[1, +),

which

implied

1+
Bp,1

(R)

is

the

critical

Besov

spaces

and

the

index

3 2

is

not

necessary

for

the

Camassa-Holm

type

equations.

Further, the non-uniform continuity of the CH equation has been investigated in many papers,

see [26­28, 32, 33].

Eqs. (1.1) has numerous remarkable features and has been studies by many authors. Chae and

Liu [6] eatablished the local existence of weak solution in W 2,p(Rd), p > d and local existence of

unique

classical

solutions

in

H s(Rd ),

s>

d 2

+

3

for

(1.1).

Then,

Li,

Yu

and

Zhai [39]

proved

that

the solutions to (1.1) with a large class of smooth initial data blows up in finite time or exists

globally in time, which settled an open problem raised by Chae and Liu [6]. Taking advantage of

the Littlewood-Paley decomposition theory, Yan and Yin [44] further discussed the local existence

and

uniqueness

of

the

solution

to

(1.1)

in

Besov

spaces

Bps,r(Rd)

with

s

+

d p

,

}

and

s

=

d p

Recently,

Li,

Dai

and

Zhu

[34]

shown

that

the

corresponding

solution

to

(1.1)

is

not

uniformly

constinuous

dependence

for

that

the

initial

data

in

Hs(Rd), s

.

Also, Li, Dai and Li in [38] have shown that the data-to-solution map for (1.1) is not uniformly

continuous dependence

in

Besov

spaces

Bps,r(Rd), s

max{1

d 2

For more results of higher

dimensional Camassa-Holm equations, see [36, 46].

However, the continuity of the data-to-solution map for the higher dimensional Camassa-Holm

equations

in

Besov

spaces

In this paper, we will pay our attention to studying the ill-posedness for the higher dimensional Camassa-Holm equations in Besov spaces. The key skill is to construct a initial data.
Now let us state our main result of this paper.

Theorem 1.1. Let d  2 and  > 2+max

1+

d p

,

3 2

with 1  p  . There exists a u0  Bp,(Rd)

and a positive constant 0 such that the data-to-solution map u0  u(t) of the Cauchy problem

(1.1) satisfies

lim sup u(t) - u0 Bp,  0. t0+
Remark 1.1. Theorem 1.1 demonstrates the ill-posedness of the higher dimensional CH equation in Bp,. More precisely, there exists a u0  Bp, such that the corresponding solution to the higher dimensional CH equation that starts from u0 does not converge back to u0 in the sense of Bp,-norm as time goes to zero. Our key argument is to construct a initial data u0.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we list some notations and recall known results. In Section 3, we present the proof of Theorem 1.1 by establishing some technical lemmas and propositions.

2 Preliminaries

2.1 General Notation
In the following, we denote by  the convolution. Given a Banach space X, we denote its norm by · X. For I  R, we denote by C(I; X) the set of continuous functions on I with values in X. Sometimes we will denote Lp(0, T ; X) by LpT X. For all f  S, the Fourier transform F f (also denoted by f ) is defined by
F f () = f () = e-ix·f (x)dx for any   Rd. Rd

2.2 Littlewood-Paley Analysis

Next, we recall some useful properties about the Littlewood-Paley decomposition and the Besov spaces.

Proposition

2.1

(Littlewood-Paley

decomposition,

See

[1]).

Let

B

:=

{



Rd

:

||



4 3

}

and

C

:=

{



Rd

:

3 4



||



8 3

}.

There

exist

two

radial

functions





Cc(B)

and





Cc(C)

both

taking values in [0, 1] such that

() + (2-j) = 1,    Rd,

j0

1 2



2()

+

2(2-j)  1,

j0

   Rd.

Proposition 2.2 (Bernstein's inequalities, See [1]). Let B be a ball and C be an annulus. A constant C > 0 exists such that for all k  N, 1  p  q  , and any function f  Lp(R), we have

Suppf  B 

Dkf Lq = sup

f

Lq



C  k+1

k+d(

1 p

-

1 q

)

f

Lp ,

||=k

Suppf  C  C-k-1k f Lp  Dkf Lq  Ck+1k f Lp.

Definition 2.1 (See [1]). For any u  S(Rd), the Littlewood-Paley dyadic blocks j are defined

as follows

0,

j u

=



(D)u = F -1(F (2-jD)u = F -1

u), (2-j

·)F

u

,

if j  -2; if j = -1; if j  0.

In the nonhomogeneous case, the following Littlewood-Paley decomposition makes sense:

u=

ju,  u  S(Rd).

j-1

Definition 2.2 (See [1]). Let s  R and 1  p, r  . The nonhomogeneous Besov space Bps,r(Rd) is defined by

Bps,r(Rd) := f  S(Rd) : f <  Bps,r(Rd) ,

where

r Lp(Rd)

, if 1  r < ,

f

Bps,r (Rd )

=

j f

, Lp(Rd)

if r = .

j-1

For simplicity, we always write u  Bps,r(Rd) and u  Bps,r(Rd) standing for u  (Bps,r(Rd))d and u  (Bps,r(Rd))d2, respectively.

Remark 2.1. It should be emphasized that the following embedding will be often used implicity:

Bps,1q(Rd)  Bps,2r(Rd) for s1 > s2 or s1 = s2, 1  q  r  .

Finally, we give some important lemmas which will be also often used throughout the paper.

Lemma 2.1 (See [1, 44]). Let (p, r)  [1, ]2 and s > max

1

+

d p

,

3 2

. Then

uv  C u v . Bps-,r2(Rd)

Bps,-r2 (Rd )

Bps,-r1 (Rd )

Hence, for the terms Q(u, u), Q(v, v), R(u, u) and R(v, v), we have

Q(u, u) - Q(v, v)  C Bps-,r1(Rd) u - v Bps,-r1(Rd) R(u, u) - R(v, v)  C Bps-,r1(Rd) u - v Bps-,r1(Rd)

u + v , Bps,r(Rd)

Bps,r (Rd )

u + v . Bps,r(R)

Bps,r (Rd )

Lemma 2.2 (See [1]). For (p, r)  [1, ]2 and s > 0, Bps,r(Rd)  L(Rd) is an algebra. Moreover, for any u, v  Bps,r(Rd)  L(Rd), we have

uv  C Bps,r(Rd)

u v + v u . Bps,r(Rd)

L (Rd )

Bps,r (Rd )

L(Rd)

In the paper, we also need some estimates for the following transport equation:

tf + v · f = g, (t, x)  R+ × Rd, f (0, x) = f0(x), x  Rd.

(2.1)

Lemma 2.3 (See [1]). Let d  N+,

1  p  ,

1



r





and



>

-

min(

d p

,

1

-

d p

).

Let

f0  Bp,r(Rd), g  L1(0, T ; Bp,r(Rd)), v  L(0, T ; B-M,(Rd)) for some  > 1 and M > 0, and

d
v  L1(0, T ; Bpp,(Rd)  L(Rd)),
v  L1(0, T ; Bp,-r1(Rd)),

if



<

1

+

d p

,

if



>

1

+

d p

(or



=

1

+

d p

,

r = 1).

Then the problem (2.1) has a unique solution f in

- the space C([0, T ]; Bp,r(Rd)), if r < ,

- the space < C([0, T ]; Bp,(Rd)) Cw([0, T ]; Bp,(Rd)), if r = .

(See [1, 40]).

Let

There

exists

a

constant

C such that for all solutions f  L(0, T ; Bp,r(Rd)) of (2.1) with initial data f0 in Bp,r(Rd) and g

in L1(0, T ; Bp,r(Rd)), we have, for a.e. t  [0, T ],

if

If f = v, then for all  > 0, V (t) = v(t) . L(Rd)

3 Proof of Theorem 1.1

3.1 Construction of Initial Data

We need to introduce smooth, radial cut-off functions to localize the frequency region. Precisely, let   C0(R) be an even, real-valued and non-negative function on R and satisfy

() =

17 12

2nx1

(x2) · (xn) and

n  2,

fn, if j = n, j(fn) = 0, if j = n.

We can obtain the similar result:

Lemma 3.1. Let 6  k, n  N+. Define the function gmk ,n(x) by

gmk ,n(x) := (x1) cos

17 12

(x2) · · · (xd)

with

0  m  n - 1.

Then we have

j (gmk ,n) =

if j = kn, if j = kn.

Proof. The proof is similar to that of in [37], and here we omit it.

3.2 Error Estimates

We first recall the following local-in-time exstence of strong solutions to (1.1) in [44].

Lemma

3.3

(See

[44]).

Let

d

p, r





and

s

max{1+

d p

,

3 2

}.

Assume

that

u0



Bps,r(Rd),

then there exists a time T = T (s, p, r, u0 ) Bps,r(Rd) > 0 such that (1.1) has a unique solution

u  C([0, T ]; Bps,r(Rd)). Moreover, for all t  [0, T ], there holds

achm u(t)  C Bps,r(Rd) u0 . Bps,r(Rd)
Proposition 3.1. Let s =  - 2 and u0  Bp,. Assume that u  L T Bp, be the solution to the Cauchy problem (1.1), we have

u(t) - u0  C t Bps,-1 u0 Bps-,1 u0 , Bps,

u(t) - u0 Bps,  Ct

0 Bps,-1 0 Bps,+1

u(t) - u0  Ct Bps,+1

u u + u u . 0 Bps, 0 Bps,+1

0 Bps,-1 0 Bps+,2

Proof. Due to Lemma 3.3, we know that there exists a positive time T = T (s, p, r, u0 Bps,(Rd)) such that

u(t)  C L T Bps, u0 Bps,  C.

Moreover,

for

taking

advantage

of

Lemma

2.4

and

(3.6),

we

have

u(t)  C L T Bp, u0 . Bp,

By the Mean Value Theorem, we obtain from (1.2) and (3.7) that

Thus, we finish the proof of Proposition 3.1.

Proposition 3.2. Let s =  - 2 and u0  Bp,. Assume that u  L T Bp, be the solution of the Cauchy problem (1.1), we have

w(t, u )  Ct u + u u u + u u , 0 Bps,

0 Bps,

0 Bps,+2

here and in what follows we denote

w(t, u0) := u(t) - u0 - tv0, v0 := -u0 · u0 + Q(u0, u0) + R(u0, u0).

In particular, we obtain

w(t, u0) Bp,-2  C u0 Bp, t2.

Proof. Taking advantage of the Mean Value Theorem and (1.2), and then using Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 2.2, we find

t
w(t, u0) Bps,  0  u - v0 d Bps,

t
 0 Q(u, u) - Q(u0, u0) + Bps, R(u, u) - R(u0, u0) d Bps,

Ct u + u u u + u u , 2

0 Bps,

0 Bps,-1 0 Bps, 0 Bps,+1

2 0 Bps,-1

0 Bps+,2

where we have used Proposition 3.1 in the last step. Thus, we complete the proof of Proposition 3.2. Now we present the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Then, for k  6, taking n > N large enough such that c2kn  2C, we deduce that

u(t) - u0 Bp,  ct2kn - C22knt2. Thus, choosing t2kn   with small , we finally conclude that
