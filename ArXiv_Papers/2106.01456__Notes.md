## Abstract

Let $G: S^{4n-1} \rightarrow S^{2n}$ be a map with nonzero Hopf Invariant. Using the generalized Hopf invariant introduced by Haj≈Çasz, Schikorra and Tyson, we show that any null-homotopy $F: B^{4n} \rightarrow B^{2n+1}$ of $G$ with small $(2n+1)$-dilation must have large $(2n)$-dilation. In the limit, this gives a simple proof that a Lipschitz null-homotopy cannot have rank$(DF) \le 2n$ almost everywhere. Conversely, we show that these results are sharp by constructing smooth null-homotopies with arbitrarily small $(2n+1)$-dilation.
