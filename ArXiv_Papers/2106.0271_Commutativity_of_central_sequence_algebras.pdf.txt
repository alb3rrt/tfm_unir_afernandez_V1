COMMUTATIVITY OF CENTRAL SEQUENCE ALGEBRAS
DOMINIC ENDERS AND TATIANA SHULMAN
Abstract. The question of which separable C*-algebras have abelian central sequence algebras was raised and studied by Phillips ([16]) and Ando-Kirchberg ([2]). In this paper we give a complete answer to their question:
A separable C*-algebra A has abelian central sequence algebra if and only if A satisfies Fell's condition. Moreover, we introduce a higher-dimensional analogue of Fell's condition and show that it completely characterizes subhomogeneity of central sequence algebras. In contrast, we show that any non-trivial extension by compact operators has not only non-abelian but not even residually type I central sequence algebra. In particular its central sequence algebra is not type I and not residually finitedimensional (RFD). Our techniques extensively use properties of nilpotent elements in C*-algebras.
Introduction
Studying the center is a key step in (C*-)algebra structure theory. In the context of operator algebras one further looks at central sequences, i.e. bounded sequences (xn) of elements of a C*-algebra A satisfying
[xn, a]  0, for any a  A. (Here for von Neumann algebras one naturally means the convergence with respect to tracial norms, while for C*-algebras it is with respect to the C*-norm).
This notion of central sequences has its origin in von Neumann algebra theory and turned out to be extremely fruitful there. In fact, the central sequence algebra was a crucial tool in several breakthrough results in von Neumann algebra theory and we refer the reader to [8] and the references therein for a more detailed discussion on this topic. In the context of this paper, a special focus was put on identifying which II1-factors have trivial central sequence algebra (these are II1-factors without the so-called property Gamma) or which have abelian central sequence algebra (those for which it is not abelian are known to be the McDuff factors).
On the C*-algebra side, the study of central sequences was initiated shortly after the success of their von Neumann algebra counterparts. Akemann and Pedersen proved that a C*-algebra A has trivial central sequence algebra if and only if A is a continuous trace algebra ([1]). The question of when the central sequence algebra of a separable C*-algebra is abelian also arose, and many significant partial results were obtained in [16].
Two decades later, the concept of central sequence algebras gained momentum again, starting from the seminal work of Kirchberg [11] ­ this time in connection with the classification program for simple nuclear C*-algebras. In particular, the

concept of strongly self-absorbing C*-algebras ([21]) and the tensorial absorption of such in terms of embeddings into central sequence algebras have become an indispensable tool in the classification program.
Progress on the question of when a central sequence algebra is abelian appeared in the work of Ando and Kirchberg ([2]) where they proved that for any nontype I C*-algebra its central sequence algebra is non-abelian. Ando and Kirchberg further provided examples (similar to the ones constructed in [15]) showing that central sequence algebras of type I C*-algebras can be both abelian and non-abelian. However, the general question of which C*-algebras have abelian central sequence algebra remained open.
In this paper we give a complete answer to this question. More generally, we characterize those C*-algebras whose central sequence algebra are subhomogeneous.

Main Theorem Let A be a separable C*-algebra and k  N. Then the central sequence algebra F (A) of A is k- subhomogeneous if and only if A satisfies Fell's condition of order k.

A C*-algebra satisfies Fell's condition if each of its irreducible representations 0 satisfies Fell's condition, meaning that there exist b  A+ and an open neighbourhood U of 0 in A^ such that (b) is a rank-one projection whenever   U (e.g. see [4], [10]). The class of C*-algebras satisfying Fell's condition is known to coincide with the class of type I0-algebras ([10]) which were introduced by Pedersen as C*algebras generated by their abelian elements (see [4]). In this paper we introduce Fell's condition of order n and the type In-algebras as a natural generalization of Fell's condition and type I0-algebras respectively. To obtain our characterization of C*-algebras with n-subhomogeneous central sequence algebra, we prove that these conditions are all equivalent (Proposition 16).
The proof of the Main Theorem above is obtained from 3 auxiliary steps listed below, each requiring its own set of techniques. These techniques, while being quite different, have one feature in common ­ they all extensively use properties of nilpotent elements in C*-algebras. The reason being that commutativity (and similarly subhomogenity) can efficiently be captured in terms of the existence of nilpotent elements with prescribed order.
· Step 1: Show that if A is a C*-algebra of operators strictly containing all compact operators, then F (A) is not n-subhomogeneous for any n  N.
For n = 1 and unital A, this step was done by Phillips ([16]). Here, in fact, we obtain a far reaching generalization of this result:

Theorem 9. Let A  B(H) be a separable C*-algebra such that A K(H). Then F (A) is not residually type I.

Our proof is also more direct in the sense that it doesn't require Connes technique for automorphism groups or the connection between automorphism groups and central sequences in general, which was the main tool in [16].
· Step 2: to prove that if A is CCR and F (A) is n-subhomogeneous, then A satisfies Fell's condition of order n.

In this step we show that without a suitable bound on the local rank of elements in A (local in the sense of the spectrum A^), it is possible to exhibit approximately central, nilpotent elements of high order. This is achieved by pulling back nilpotent elements through high-dimensional representations while preserving approximate centrality.

· Step 3: Show that if A is type In-1, then F (A) is n-subhomogeneous.
In this step we make heavy use of liftability of nilpotent elements. This way we can transfer information about commutativity / subhomogenity from the central sequence algebra F (A) back to the algebra A itself. Furthermore, we exploit stability of nilpotent elements to squeeze asymptotically central nilpotent elements into subhomogeneous subalgebras which eventually leads to the desired dimensional constraints.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 we give preliminaries on central sequences and necessary information on properties of nilpotent elements in C*-algebras. Section 2 is dedicated to Step 1, i.e. studying central sequences in extensions of compact operators. In particular, Theorem 9 mentioned above is proved there. In section 3 we introduce Fell's condition of higher rank and type In-algebras and prove the equivalence of Fell's condition of order n and of being of type In-1. In Section 4 we do Step 2, that is we prove that if A is CCR and F (A) is n-subhomogeneous, then A satisfies Fell's condition of order n. In Section 5 we do Step 3, that is we prove that if A is type In-1, then F (A) is n-subhomogeneous. In Section 6 we prove the Main Theorem and deduce its consequences for automorphisms and derivations of C*-algebras satisfying Fell's condition.

1. Preliminaries
1.1. Central sequence algebras. A central sequence in a C*-algebra is a bounded sequence which commutes asymptotically with each element of the algebra. "Asymptotically" is meant with respect to a given filter; in particular in [11] it was meant with respect to a fixed free ultrafilter, while in earlier works (e.g. [1], [16]) one used the usual convergence (that is the filter of all cofinite sets).
Fix a filter  on N. Let A be a C*-algebra. We denote by A the C*-algebra of all bounded sequences with entries in A. Elements of A will be written as (xn). The ideal c of A is defined as
c = {(xn)  A | xn  0}.
The C*-ultraproduct algebra A is defined by A = A/c. The canonical surjection A  A will be denoted by . The elements a  A will be naturally identified with the images of the constant sequences (a, a, . . .) in A. Let A A be the relative commutant of A in A, i.e. elements of A A are represented by central sequences, that is sequences (xn) satisfying
[xn, a]  0, for any a  A.
Furthermore, consider the annihilator of A in A, i.e.
Ann(A, A) = {((xn)) | xna + axn  0, for any a  A},

4

which is an ideal in A. Dividing out this ideal we obtain the central sequence algebra F (A, ):
F (A, ) = (A A)/Ann(A, A)
Note that for unital A we have Ann(A, A) = 0, so that the definition of F (A, ) reduces to F (A, ) = A A in this case.
In [16], for a unital C*-algebra A, a central sequence (xn) in A was called hypercentral if
[xn, yn]  0 for any central sequence (yn) in A. This definition can be extended to the non-unital case as follows: a central sequence (xn) is hypercentral if
[xn, yn]a + a[xn, yn]  0,
for any central sequence (yn) and any a  A (see also [12] where such sequences were called strict-hypercentral).

The following question was first raised in [16]:

When are all central sequences hypercentral?

Clearly this is a question of when F (A, ) is abelian where  is the filter of all cofinite sets. Not surprisingly, this question turns out to be equivalent to the main question of [2], asking when F (A, ) is abelian, where  is a free ultrafilter. The following proposition shows the equivalence of these two questions, as well as a quantitative version thereof.

Proposition 1. Let A be a separable C*-algebra and let A1 denote its unit ball. Let  be a filter on N containing the filter of all cofinite sets. The following are equivalent:

(1) F (A, ) is abelian; (2) For any finite set F  A1 and  > 0 there exist a finite set G  A1 and
 > 0 such that

max [a, x] < 

aG
max [a, y]

<



[x, y]f

<  for all f  F .

aG

Consequently, if F (A, ) is abelian for one such filter, then it is abelian for any such filter.

Proof. (1)(2): By contradiction. Assume otherwise, i.e. assume there exists a finite set F  A1 and  > 0 such that for all n  N there are xn, yn  A1 with

(1)

max [a, xn] < 1/n and max [a, yn] < 1/n

aGn

aGn

(where G1  G2  . . . is an increasing sequence of finite subsets of A1 with dense union) but such that [xn, yn]f   for some f  F and all n. From (1) we find that [xn, a]  0 and [yn, a]  0 for any a  A. Since  contains the filter of all cofinite sets, it implies that [xn, a]  0 and [yn, a]  0. Then writing x = (x1, x2, . . .) and y = (y1, y2, . . .), we find x, y  A with (x), (y)  A A, but

[(x), (y)]f

= lim
n

[xn, yn]f

 ,

i.e. [(x), (y)] / Ann(A, A) and hence the images of x and y in F (A, ) do not commute.

(2)(1): Let x = (x1, x2, . . .) and y = (y1, y2, . . .) be two contractions in A such that (x), (y)  A A. Fix f  A. Let  > 0 and choose G and  with respect to F = {f } and . For a  A, let Ea = {n  N | [a, xn] < } and Ea = {n  N | [a, yn] < }. Since [a, xn]  0 and [a, yn]  0, we have Ea, Ea  . Let E = aG(Ea Ea ). Then {n  N | [xn, yn]f < }  E  . Therefore [xn, yn]f  0. Since it holds for any f  F , we conclude that [(x), (y)]  Ann(A, A). Thus the images of x and y in F (A, ) commute.

From now we will write F (A) instead of F (A, ).
1.2. Nilpotents in C*-algebras. An element x  A is nilpotent of order n if xn = 0. It was discovered in [13] that a nilpotent element in any quotient C*algebra can be lifted to a nilpotent of the same order. In [17] it was proved that this can even be done in a norm preserving way.
Theorem 2. (Liftability of nilpotent contractions) Let I be an ideal in a C*-algebra A and let  : A  A/I be the canonical surjection. Let x  A/I be such that xn = 0 and x  1. Then there exists a  A such that (a) = x, an = 0, and a  1.
An important consequence is the stability of nilpotents under small perturbations.
Corollary 3. (Stability of nilpotent contractions) Given n  N and  > 0, there exists  such that the following holds: for any C*-algebra A and any x  A satisfying
xn   and x  1 there is y  A such that yn = 0, y  1 and y - x  .
Recall that a C*-algebra is n-subhomogeneous if the dimension of each its irreducible representations is not larger than n. The following characterization of n-subhomogenity is obtained in [9].
Theorem 4. A C*-algebra A is n-subhomogeneous if and only if each nilpotent element in A has order not larger than n.
For reader's convenience we will give here an alternative proof of it.
Proof: Suppose A is not n-subhomogeneous. If A is type I, there exists an irreducible representation  on a Hilbert space H of dimension larger than n (possibly infinite) such that (A)  K(H). Since there exists an operator T  K(H) such that T n+1 = 0 but T n = 0 we can apply Theorem 2 and lift T to a nilpotent element of order n + 1 in A. If A is not type I, we find the CAR-algebra as a subquotient of A by Glimm's theorem ([7]) and an element T therein with T n+1 = 0 but T n = 0. Again, we can lift T to a nilpotent element of order n + 1 in A just as before.
The opposite implication is clear: if A is n-subhomogeneous and a  A is a nilpotent, then under each irreducible representation (a)n = 0, which implies an = 0.
Corollary 5. A C*-algebra is commutative if and only if it does not contain any non-trivial nilpotent elements.
For a Hilbert space H, let B(H) denote the C*-algebra of all bounded operators on H and K(H) the ideal of all compact operators. Recall that a C*-algebra A is CCR if for any its irreducible representation  on a Hilbert space H,
(A) = K(H).

If for any irreducible representation  of A on a Hilbert space H,
(A)  K(H),
then A is called GCR or type I. For more detailed information on CCR and type I C*-algebras the reader is referred to [[4], section IV.1].
In [18] it was proved that the class of type I C*-algebras is completely characterized by the behavior of nilpotent elements.
Theorem 6. Let A be a C*-algebra. The following are equivalent: (i) A is type I; (ii) The spectral radius function a  (a) is continuous on A; (iii) The closure of nilpotents in A consists of quasinilpotents.
(The implication (i) (ii) was proved in [19]). Thus in all non-type I algebras there exist non-quasinilpotent limits of nilpo-
tents. In some non-type I C*-algebras one can even find non-zero normal limits of nilpotents, e.g. in B(H) ([3]), in all infinite-dimensional UHF-algebras and in all unital, simple, purely infinite algebras ([20]). However, such normal limits do not exist in arbitrary non-type I C*-algebras, as the following observation from [18] shows.
Proposition 7. If the closure of nilpotents in a C*-algebra A contains a normal element, then A is not residually type I.
Here a residually type I C*-algebra denotes a C*-algebra that has a separating family of -homomorphisms into type I C*-algebras. The class of residually type I C*-algebras is known to being strictly larger than the class of type I C*-algebras as, for instance, it contains all residually finite-dimensional (RFD) C*-algebras which include numerous non-type I examples.

2. Extensions by compact operators
In this section we consider extensions of non-zero C*-algebras by compact operators or, in other words, C*-algebras of operators strictly containing all compact operators. In the unital case Phillips proved that for such C*-algebras the corresponding central sequence algebras are not abelian ([16]). Here we obtain a far reaching generalization of this result stating that they are not even residually type I. Moreover, our result covers the non-unital case as well. Our proof is also more direct in the sense that it doesn't use Connes technique for automorphism groups or the connection between automorphism groups and central sequences in general, which was the main tool in [16].
The results of this section will allow us to pass from type I to CCR C*-algebras later when we will characterize subhomogeneity of central sequence algebras.
Let H be a separable, infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and denote by  : B(H)  B(H)/K(H) the canonical surjection.
Lemma 8. Let A  B(H) be a separable C*-algebra, then (A) contains a copy of B(H).
Proof. Let  : A  B(H) denote the inclusion map. Let 0 : A  A/(A  K(H))  B(H) be any non-degenerate representation and set  = 0 , i.e.  = 0  1 : A  B(H  H). By Voiculescu's theorem ([5], Th. 1.7.3),  and    are unitarily

COMMUTATIVITY OF CENTRAL SEQUENCE ALGEBRAS

equivalent after modding out the compacts. In particular, (A) contains a copy of ((  )(A))  (0  (1  B(H))) = B(H).
Next we prove a key step towards Theorem 22 which will eventually serve as a reduction step from type I C*-algebras to the CCR case. Our strategy is to obtain approximately central nilpotent elements by lifting suitable nilpotent elements from the Calkin algebra and then absorb them into the C*-algebra of interest using compact cut-downs while approximately preserving commutation relations from the Calkin algebra. The idea that the relative commutant in the Calkin algebra might be useful in exploring central sequences is somewhat inspired by Theorem 2.7 in [16].
Theorem 9. Let A  B(H) be a separable C*-algebra such that A K(H). Then F (A) is not residually type I.
Proof. At first we observe that the proof of Lemma 8 in addition shows that for any a  A and any b in the copy of (0  (1  B(H))) inside (A) we have
(a)b = b(a) = (a) b . Now fix any a0  A\K(H) with (a0) = 1. Since in B(H) there exists a sequence of nilpotents converging to a non-zero
normal operator ([3]), by Lemma 8 and the observation above we can find nilpotent elements bj  (A), j  N, and a non-zero normal element b  (A) such that bj  b, bj = 1, and bj(a0) = 1 for any j  N. Since the bj's converge to a normal element, by passing to a subsequence we can further assume that
bj - bj-1 < 1/2j and [bj , bj] < 1/j. Let sj be the order of nilpotence of bj. By Theorem 2 we can lift each bj to a nilpotent contraction T (j)  B(H) of the
same order sj. Then all T (j) obtained this way will commute with A modulo the compacts. We fix a dense subset a1, a2, . . . in the unit ball of A.
Now let {k} be an approximate unit in K(H) which is quasicentral for the C*algebra C(A, T (1 ), T (2 ), . . .). We can then choose kn , denoted by kn for short, such that

(2)

kn[T (j), ai] - [T (j), ai] < 1/n,

(3)

[kn, ai] < 1/n,

(4)

[kn, T (j)]

(5)

(1 - kn)(T (j) - T (j-1)) < 1/2j,

(6)

[((1 - kn)T (j)), (1 - kn)T (j)] < 1/j,

(7)

(1 - kn)T (j)a0  1,

i  n, j  n, i  n,
j  n,
1 < j  n, j  n,
for any j, n.

We set Tn(j) = (1 - kn)T (j),
then by (2), (3) it follows that for each n

(8)

[Tn(j), ai] = [T (j), ai] - kn[T (j), ai] + [ai, kn]T (j) < 2/n, i  n, j  n.

Now let {y} be another approximate unit in K(H) which is quasicentral for the C*-algebra C(A, T (1), T (2), . . .). (We can actually take the same q.a.u. {k}, but
we choose different notation for convenience.) Then we can find yn such that

and, since y  1 in the strong operator topology,

Let Then by (8), (9)

xn(j) = ynTn(j)  K(H)  A.

[x(nj), ai] = yn[Tn(j), ai] + [yn, ai]Tn(j) < 3/n, i, j  n.
Thus (x(nj))nN is a central sequence in A for each j. By (4) and Lemma 19 (v) we verify

Let x(j) = (x(nj))nN  A, for each j  N. By (14), each (x(j)) is nilpotent. Using (5) we find

(x(j)) - (x(j-1))

.

which implies that the sequence (x(j)) is Cauchy and hence converges to (x)  A A, for some x = (xn). By (11),

[(x(j)), (x(j))]  1/j

and hence (x) is normal. By (12), (x(j))a0  1 for every j  N and hence (x)a0  1 which implies that (x) / Ann(A, A). Therefore the images of
x(j) in F (A), j  N, form a sequence of nilpotents converging to a non-zero normal
element. By Proposition 7, it follows that F (A) is not residually type I.

Recall that a C*-algebra is called residually finite-dimensional (RFD) if it has a separating family of finite-dimensional representations.
Corollary 10. Let A  B(H) be a separable C*-algebra such that A K(H). Then F (A) is not type I and not RFD.

3. Fell's condition of order n and type In C*-algebras. 3.1. Fell's condition of order n.

Definition(e.g. see [10]) An irreducible representation 0 of a C*-algebra A satisfies Fell's condition if there exist b  A+ and an open neighbourhood U of 0 in A^ such that (b) is a rank-one projection whenever   U .

Definition ([4], [10]) A C*-algebra A is said to satisfy Fell's condition (also is called Fell algebra) if every irreducible representation of A satisfies Fell's condition.

Remark 11. In the definition of Fell's condition one can replace the requirement that (b) is a projection by the requirement that 0(b) = 0. Indeed suppose there exist a  A+ and an open neighbourhood U of 0 in A^ such that 0(a) = 0 and (a) has rank one whenever   U . Passing to a smaller neighborhood, we can assume that the spectrum of (a) consists of 0 and a number bigger than 0(a) /2 whenever   U . Let f be a function which vanishes at 0 and satisfies f (t) = 1 for any t  0(a) /2. Let b = f (a). Then (b) is a rank-one projection whenever   U.

We now introduce Fell's condition of higher rank.

Definition An irreducible representation 0 of A satisfies Fell's condition of order k if there exist b  A+ and an open neighbourhood U of 0 in A^ such that 0(b) = 0 and (b) has rank not larger than k whenever   U .

Definition A C*-algebra A is said to satisfy Fell's condition of order k if every irreducible representation of A satisfies Fell's condition of order k.

Example 12. The C*-algebra

A = {f  C([0, 1], M2) | f (1) is diagonal} satisfies Fell's condition of order 1 (in other words, it is a Fell algebra).

Example 13. The C*-algebra





A = {f  C([0, 1], M3) | f (1) = 

  , , µ  C} µ

satisfies Fell's condition of order 2 but not of order 1.

Example 14. Let T (M2) be the telescopic C*-algebra associated with the UHF algebra
C  M2  M4  . . .  M2,
that is T (M2) = {f  C0((0, ], M2) | t  i  f (t)  M2i }.
Let A = {f  T (M2) | f ()  C1}.
Then A is CCR but does not satisfy Fell's condition of order k, for any k  N.

One can wonder whether in the definition of Fell's condition of higher order one can additionally require (b) to be a projection, analogously to Fell's condition of order 1 (see Remark 11). It turns out that it is not the case anymore when the order is bigger than 1, as the following example shows.

Let

A = {f  C(S, M2) |  g  C0[-1, 1) s. t. f ((0, t)) =

Then for any f  A, f ((0, 0))  C12. Let  = (ev(0,0))11  A^. We notice that for

0 = f ((0, x)) =

= 0. In other words,

in P rimA, which coincides with A^ since A is subhomogeneous.

Now, since A is 2-subhomogeneous, it satisfies Fell's condition of order 2. How-

ever we will show that there is no h  A+ which locally is a non-zero projection

(of rank nor larger than 2) around . Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that

there is h  A+ and a neighborhood U of  such that (h) is a non-zero projection,

for any   U .

Let

By (15) and by the

it follows that

it follows that

3.2. Type In algebras. Let A be a C*-algebra. Recall that an element x  A is abelian if the hereditary C*-subalgebra xAx is commutative ([4]). Equivalently ([4], Prop. IV.1.1.7), x is abelian if and only if rank (a)  1 for each irreducible representation  of A. A is called type I0 if it is generated by its abelian elements ([4]).
Now we introduce C*-algebras of higher type.

Definition An element x  A has global rank not larger than n if rank (a)  n for each irreducible representation  of A.

Definition A C*-algebra A is type In if it is generated by elements of global rank not larger than n + 1.
(In fact "generated" can be replaced by "spanned" as the rank of product is always not larger than the minimum of the ranks of multipliers).
Clearly any type In algebra is CCR.
3.3. Fell's condition of order n is equivalent to being type In-1. The proof below goes along the lines of the proof of the fact [[10], Th. 3.3] that Fell's property is equivalent to being type I0.
Lemma 16. Let A be a C*-algebra and   A^. The following are equivalent: (i)  satisfies Fell's condition of order n; (ii) there exists a  A+ of global rank not larger than n such that (a) = 0.
Proof. (i)  (ii): Since  satisfies Fell's condition of order n, there is b  A and a neighborhood U of  such that (b) = 0 and rank (b)  n, for any   U . Let
I = ker .
/U
Since   U ,  does not vanish on I. Then for any approximate unit {i} in I, (i) converges to the identity in the strong operator topology. Hence we can choose  such that (ibi) = 0. Let a = ibi. Then rank (a) = 0, for any  / U , and rank (a)  rank (b)  n, for any   U . Hence a has global rank not larger than n and (a) = 0.
(ii)  (i): By taking b = a and U = A^, we see that (i) holds.
Proposition 17. A C*-algebra A satisfies Fell's condition of order n if and only if A is type In-1.
Proof. "Only if": Let J  A be the C-algebra generated by all elements of global rank not larger than n. By Lemma 16, no irreducible representation of A vanishes on J. Since J is in fact an ideal, it follows that J = A.
"If": if A is type In-1, then for any   A^ there is a  A+ of global rank not larger than n such that (a) = 0. By Lemma 16 we are done.

4. A is CCR and F (A) is k-subhomogeneous  A satisfies Fell's condition of order k.
Theorem 18. Let A be a separable CCR C*-algebra. If F (A) is k-subhomogeneous, then A satisfies Fell's condition of order k.
Below we use notation {eij} for matrix units in any matrix algebra.
Proof. Assume   A^ does not satisfy Fell's condition of order k and let h  A be a strictly positive element with (h) = 1. By Theorem 4, it will be sufficient to construct a nilpotent element of order k + 1 but not of order k in F (A). Given a finite subset G  A and  > 0, it suffices to find x  A1 with xk+1  ,
xkh  1 -  and [x, G]  . Without loss of generality we may assume that G  Am := (h - 1/m)+A(h - 1/m)+
for some m > 2/ and that (h - 1/m)+  G. Since A is assumed to be CCR, (h) is compact and hence ((h - 1/m)+) has finite rank. We can therefore regard the

12

restriction |Am as a finite-dimensional representation Am  Md for some d. We may clearly further assume that |Am ((h - 1/m)+) is diagonal with
(|Am ((h - 1/m)+))11 = |Am ((h - 1/m))+ = ((h - 1/m)+) = 1 - 1/m.
The reduction to the finite-dimensional case allows us to employ the non-commutative Urysohn lemma ([[6], Th.2.3.3]) as a technical tool to parameterize a neighbourhood of . Concretely, we get a commutative diagram with exact rows

where T (C, Md) = {f  C0((0, 2], Md) : f (t)  C · 1d for all t  1}
and S(C, Md) = {f  C0((0, 2), Md) : f (t)  C · 1d for all t  1},
with a proper *-homomorphism  (meaning herJ (image()) equals all of J). Denote by f1 the scalar function on [0, 2] which vanishes on [0, 1], satisfies f1(2) =
1 and is linear in between. We can thus decompose each element g  G as

g = g0 + (g1)

with g0  J by defining

g1 = f1  |Am (g)  T (C, Md).
Let Bn = {f  S(C, Md) | supp f  [0, 2 - 1/n]}.
Then
S(C, Md) = Bn
n
and J = her ((S(C, Md)))) = n her((Bn)). Therefore, since G is finite, there is n  N such that for each g  G there is g0  her((Bn)) such that g0 - g0  . In particular, using the scalar function fn which vanishes on [0, 2 - 1/n], satisfies fn(2) = 1 and is linear in between, for each g  G we conclude that g0 and (fn1d) are orthogonal to each other.
Let y := (fn  e11)  Am  A. Since (y) = e11 = 0 and by assumption  does not satisfy Fell's condition of order k, there is an irreducible representation   A^ such that
rank((y))  k + 1.

We consider the restriction |Am, which can again be regarded as a finite-dimensional, irreducible representation Am  Md for suitable d. Hence the composition |Am decomposes as
|Am    jJ evtj
with finite index set J  [0, 2]. Since the support of fn  e11 is contained in [2 - 1/n, 2], the rank condition above implies that J contains at least k + 1 many

(not necessarily different) tj's with tj  (2 - 1/n, 2]. After unitary conjugation we can therefore write
k+1
|Am   = ( evtj )  ~
j=1

with t1, ..., tk+1 in (2 - 1/n, 2]. This implies that for each g = g0 + (g1)  G we find

(16)

|Am ((g1)) = (kj=+11g1(tj ))  ~(g1) = (|Am (g))k+1  ~(g1).

Moreover, as |Am ((fn  1d)) = (kj=+11fn(tj)1d)  ~(fn) with each fn(tj) > 0, orthogonality of g0 and (fn) implies that in the 2 × 2 block decomposition of |Am(g0 ) the only possibly non-zero block is the (2, 2)-block. Combining this with (16), we find each |Am(g) to be of the form
|Am (g) = (|Am (g))k+1  rg + Sg

for some rg  Md-(k+1)d and Sg  Md such that Sg  .

Consequently, the element z =

Md

is

a

nilpotent

contraction

of order k + 1 and commutes with (G) up to 2. We can lift z to an element x in

Am which satisfies xk+1   and commutes with G up to 3. Since (h - 1/m)+

is also an element of G, we further verify

xkh  xk(h - 1/m)+ - 1/m  |Am (xk(h - 1/m)+) - 1/m  (1d  e1,k+1)((|Am ((h - 1/m)+))k+1) -  - 1/m = |Am ((h - 1/m)+) -  - 1/m = (1 - 1/m) -  - 1/m > 1 - 2.

5. A is type In  F (A) is (n + 1)-subhomogeneous The first lemma is trivial.

Lemma 19. Let x, a be contractions in a C*-algebra and   0. Then for any

k  N the following holds:

(i) [x, a]    [x, ak]  k;

(ii) [x, a]    (axa)k = Ak + axka2k-1, where Ak  k(k - 1); (iii) [x, a]   and xk = 0  (axa)k  k(k - 1);

(iv) x - a    xk - ak  k;

(v)

Proof. (i) By induction: suppose for k  l - 1 it is proved. For k = l we have [x, al] = [x, al-1]a + al-1[x, a] and therefore [x, al]  (l - 1) +  = l.
(ii) By induction: For k = 1 it is clear. Suppose it is proved for k  N . We have

(axa)N+1 = (axa)N axa = (AN + axN a2N-1)axa = AN axa + axN [a2N , x]a + axN+1a2N+1 = AN+1 + axN+1a2N+1,
where by (i) AN+1  N (N - 1) + 2N  = (N + 1)N .
(iii) follows from (ii).

(iv) By induction: suppose it is proved for k  N . We have

xN+1 - aN+1  (x - a)xN + a(xN - aN )   + N  = (N + 1).

(v) We will show by induction that (xa)k = xkak + Ek, where

For k = 1 it holds, and we assume it holds for k  N . Then for k = N + 1 we have

(xa)N+1 = xaxN aN + xaEN = xN+1aN+1 + x[a, xN ]aN + xaEN .

By this and (i) we obtain

Lemma 20. For any  > 0 there is a  > 0 such that whenever e  (B(H))+,1 is of rank not larger than N and x  (B(H))1 with xN+1 = 0, then
[x, e]    exN   and xN e  .

Proof. By stability of nilpotent contractions (Corollary 3) there exists 0 such that whenever z is an element of any C-algebra with zN+1  0 and z  1, there is an element y in the same C*-algebra with yN+1 = 0, y  1, y - z  /2N.

Theorem 21. If A is type In, then F (A) is (n+1)-subhomogeneous.

Proof. Let x  F (A) be a contraction such that xn+2 = 0. By liftability of nilpotent contractions (Theorem 2), we can represent x by a sequence (x1, x2, . . .) with xnk+2 = 0, xk  1, k  N.
Fix a contraction a  A of global rank not larger than n + 1 and let  > 0. Let  be as in Lemma 20. As

liwm[xk ,

(aa

liwm[xk ,

(a

there is E   such that for any k  E we have

[xk

(aa

)

1 2

  and

[xk

,

(a

a)

 .

Since (aa)1/2 and (aa)1/2 are positive contractions and have global rank not larger
than n + 1, by Lemma 20 for any irreducible representation  of A and any k  E we have
((aa)1/2)(xnk+1)   and ((aa)1/2)(xnk+1)  .
Let (a) = V((aa)1/2) = ((aa)1/2)W, where V, W  B(H), be the polar decomposition of (a). Then

axnk +1

= sup


(a)(xnk +1 )

= sup


V ((aa )1/2 )(xnk +1 )

 ((aa)1/2)(xnk+1)  ,

for any k  E. Similarly xnk+1a  , for any k  E. It follows that the set {k  N | axnk+1   and xnk+1a  } contains E and therefore belongs to . Thus lim axnk+1 = lim xnk+1a = 0. Since this holds for any contraction a  A of global rank not larger than n + 1 and these span A by assumption, we conclude that the image of the sequence (xn1 +1, xn2 +1, . . .) in A A belongs to Ann(A, A). Hence xn+1 = 0. By Theorem 4, F (A) is (n + 1)-subhomogeneous.

6. When central sequence algebras are subhomogeneous
Theorem 22. Let A be a separable C*-algebra and k  N. Then F (A) is ksubhomogeneous if and only if A satisfies Fell's condition of order k.
Proof. "Only if": In [[2], Th.1.1] Ando and Kirchberg proved that if A is a nontype I C*-algebra, then F (A) is not abelian. We note that their proof in fact shows even that F (A) is not type I, because they proved that it contains a type III factor as a subquotient [[2], p.7].
Hence the assumption that F (A) is k-subhomogeneous implies that A is type I. If A was not CCR, then it would quotient onto a C*-algebra B  B(H) such that B  K(H). By Theorem 9, F (B) is not residually type I and hence not ksubhomogeneous. By [[11], Rem. 1.15 (3)], F (A) would not be k-subhomogeneous either. Thus A must be CCR. The statement follows now from Theorem 18.
"If": By Theorem 21 and the "only if" part of Proposition 17.

Now we can answer a question raised by J. Phillips ([16]) and by Ando and Kirchberg ([2]).
Corollary 23. Let A be a separable C*-algebra. The following are equivalent: (1) F (A) is abelian; (2) All central sequences in A are hypercentral; (3) A satisfies Fell's condition.
Proof. Follows from Theorem 22, Proposition 1 and the paragraph preceding Proposition 1.

Recall that an automorphism  of a C*-algebra A is inner if there is a unitary u  A such that (a) = uxu, for any a  A. An automorphism is approximately inner if it is a pointwise limit of inner automorphisms. The set of all approximately inner automorphisms of A will be denoted by Aut A.
An automorphism  is centrally trivial if (xn) - xn  0, for every central sequence {xn} of A ([16]). The set of all centrally trivial automorphisms of A is denoted by Ct A.
Corollary 24. Let A be a unital separable C*-algebra that satisfies Fell's condition. Then any approximately inner automorphism of A is centrally trivial.
Proof. By [[16], Lemma 3.5] if all central sequences in A are hypercentral, then Inn A  Ct A. The statement follows now from Corollary 23.
Corollary 25. If a C*-algebra A satisfies Fell's condition but does not have continuous trace, then A has an outer derivation.
Proof. Follows from [[12], Prop.5.5] and Corollary 23.
