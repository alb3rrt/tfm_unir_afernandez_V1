## Abstract

We extend the notion of a composition series in an abelian category to allow the multiset of composition factors to have arbitrary cardinality. We then provide sufficient axioms for the existence of such composition series and the validity of "Jordan-Hölder-Schreier-like" theorems. We give several examples of objects which satisfy these axioms, including pointwise finite-dimensional persistence modules, Prüfer modules, and presheaves. Finally, we show that if an abelian category with a simple object has both arbitrary coproducts and arbitrary products, then it contains an object which both fails to satisfy our axioms and admits at least two composition series with distinct cardinalities.
