## Abstract

Curated scientific databases play an important role in the scientific endeavour and support is needed for the significant effort that goes into their creation and maintenance. This demonstration and case study illustrate how curation support has been developed in the Links cross-tier programming language, a functional, strongly typed language with language-integrated query and support for temporal databases. The chosen case study uses weekly released Covid-19 fatality figures from the Scottish government which exhibit updates to previously released data. This data allows the capture and query of update provenance in our prototype. This demonstration will highlight the potential for language-integrated support for curation to simplify and streamline prototyping of web-applications in support of scientific databases
