CENTRALLY HARMONIC SPACES
P. B. GILKEY AND J. H. PARK
Abstract. We construct examples of centrally harmonic spaces by generalizing work of Copson and Ruse. We show that these examples are generically not centrally harmonic at other points. We use this construction to exhibit manifolds which are not conformally flat but such that their density function agrees with Euclidean space.

1. Introduction

1.1. Notational conventions. Any 2-dimensional manifold is Einstein; thus this condition imposes no additional restrictions and the case m = 2 is often exceptional. We shall therefore sometimes assume that m  3 to simplify the analysis. If  = (1, . . . , m)  Rm, set:

 2 := (1)2 + · · · + (m)2, d := d1 . . . dm,

ge := (d1)2 + · · · + (dm)2, 0e := -21 - · · · - 2m , S0(r) := { :  = r}.

There is a radial solution to the equation 0ef = 0 for  > 0 given by

log  2 if m = 2

f () :=

 2-m if m > 2 .

Ruse [12] was the first to examine radial solutions to the Laplace equation in the more general context of a Riemannian manifold M = (M, g) of dimension m  2. Let 0M (resp. 1M) be the Laplace-Beltrami operator on functions (resp. 1-forms). Let rP (Q) be the geodesic distance from a point P to another point Q of M . A function f is said to be radial if f (Q) = f(rP (Q)) for some function f of a single variable; in the interests of notational simplification, we shall identify f with f
when no confusion is likely to result. Let P be the injectivity radius. If there exists a non-constant radial function so that 0Mf = 0 for 0 < r < P , then M is said to be centrally harmonic about P . If M is centrally harmonic about every point, then M is said to be a harmonic space (see Willmore [15]).
Much of the subsequent work in the field has focussed on harmonic spaces. But
in this note, we will go back to the original question and study spaces which are
centrally harmonic about a point P . There are a number of useful characterizations of this property. Let (1, . . . , m) be geodesic coordinates centered at a point P of M . Such coordinate systems are characterized by the fact that the curves t  t
are unit speed geodesics from P if  = 1 and hence rP () =  if  < P . The Riemannian measure defined by g is ~ P d where ~ P := det gij is the associated volume density function. Let SP (r) := {  TP M :  = r} be the geodesic sphere of radius r centered at P and let (r, )  r ·  define geodesic polar coordinates where   SP (1) and 0 < r < P . If d is the Euclidean volume element of SP (1),

then d = rm-1drd so the volume density in geodesic polar coordinates is given by P := rm-1~ P . Let
P := r log(P ()) ; P is the mean curvature of the geodesic sphere SP (  ) at   TP M . For   C, let E0P () (resp. E1P ()) be the eigen-space of radial functions (resp. 1-forms) defined by , i.e.,
E0P () := 0  C(0, P ) : 0M(0(r)) = 0(r) , E1P () := 1dr  C(0, P )dr : 1M(1(r)dr) = 1(r)dr .
Note that we exclude the origin r = 0; these functions are permitted to be singular at the center point P . If  = 0, then d is an isomorphism from E0P () to E1P () so it suffices to study E0P () in this instance. Let H0P (resp. H1P ) be the space of radial harmonic functions (resp. 1-forms), i.e., H0P := E0P (0) and H1P := E1P (0).
1.2. Characterizations of centrally harmonic spaces. The following result was established by the authors previously [8].

Theorem 1.1. The following assertions are equivalent and if any is satisfied, then

M is centrally harmonic about the point P . If they hold at every point, then M

is said to be a harmonic space. Let  = 0.

(a) P is radial.

(b) ~ P is radial.

(c) P is radial.

(d) dim{H0P } = 2. (e) dim{H0P }  2.

(f) dim{H1P } = 2.

(g) dim{H1P }  1. (h) dim{E0P ()} = 2. (i) dim{E0P ()}  1.

(j) dim{E1P ()} = 2. (k) dim{E1P ()}  1. (l) 0Mr is radial.

(m) Geodesic spheres about P have constant mean curvature.

1.3. Asymptotic expansion of the volume density function in geodesic coordinates. If M a Riemannian manifold, then we can expand


P ()   m-1 1 + Hk()

(1.a)

k=2

in a power series about the origin where Hk(c) = ckHk() for c  R; we omit the dependence on the point P in the interests of notational simplification. Let R be

the curvature tensor of M and let Jk() be the endomorphism of TP M defined by the identity
g(Jk()1, 2) = (kR)(1, , , 2; , . . . , ) ;

J0() is the Jacobi operator and Jk() = (k J0)(). We have, see for example the discussion on page 229 of [15], that

1.4. Examples of harmonic spaces. If M is a simply connected 2-point homogeneous space, i.e., if M is either Rm or M is a rank one symmetric space, then the isometry group of M acts transitively on the set of unit tangent vectors and hence P is radial for any P ; consequently any 2-point homogeneous space is centrally harmonic about any point and hence is a harmonic space. In negative curvature, the Damek-Ricci spaces are also harmonic spaces; these are solvmanifolds, but need not be 2-point homogeneous spaces. All known harmonic spaces are locally homogeneous and modeled on one of these geometries. We refer to Berndt et. al. [1] for further details.

1.5. Constructing centrally harmonic spaces. Copson and Ruse [6] gave examples of centrally harmonic spaces by noting that a radial conformal deformation of the Euclidean metric ge is centrally harmonic about the origin. More generally, if M = (M, g) is the germ of a Riemannian manifold, and if  is a smooth non-zero function of 1-variable, we define a radial conformal deformation of M by setting
M := (M, (rP2 )-2g) .
In Section 3, we will establish the following result which shows if M is centrally harmonic about P , then M is centrally harmonic about P as well. Since we can always take the base manifold M to be a harmonic space, this permits us to construct many centrally harmonic spaces generalizing the examples of Copson and Ruse [6].
Theorem 1.3. If M = (M, g) is the germ of a Riemannian manifold which centrally harmonic about P , then M is centrally harmonic about P as well.
1.6. Space forms. M is said to be a space form if M has constant sectional curvature. Let U be an open subset of R, let  be a non-zero analytic function on U , let O := {  Rm :  2  U }, and let () := (  2)  C(O). Define a real-analytic radial conformal deformation of the standard Euclidean metric ge by setting
N := (O, -2ge) .
Let a,b(t) := a + bt define Na,b for (a, b) = (0, 0). Although the following result is well-known, we present a proof in Section 4 for the sake of completeness since we will need to develop the requisite preliminaries in any event; we suppose m  3 as that is the case of interest.
Lemma 1.4. Let m  3.
(1) If  is linear, then N is a space form. (2) If N is a space form, then  is linear. (3) Na,b has constant sectional curvature 4ab. (4) If M has constant sectional curvature , M is locally isometric to N1,4 .

1.7. Radial conformal deformations which are centrally harmonic about an intermediate point. Let L be the second fundamental form of the geodesic sphere SP (  ) about P which passes through . We say SP (  ) is totally umbillic at  if L is a multiple of the identity. As noted by Copson and Ruse [6], a radial conformal deformation of Euclidean space is in general not centrally harmonic about any other point. Recall that every harmonic space is Einstein and that every Einstein manifold is real analytic. We will prove the following result in Section 5.

P. B. GILKEY AND J. H. PARK

Theorem 1.5. Let P be a point of an Einstein manifold M = (M, g) of dimension m  3. Assume that  is real analytic and that M is centrally harmonic about some vector  with 0 <  < P in geodesic coordinates.
(1) If SP (  ) is not totally umbillic at , then  is constant. (2) If M is a space form, then M is a space form.
1.8. Totally umbillic geodesic spheres. The Jacobi operator J0() is a selfadjoint endomorphism of TP M . Let J~0() be the restriction of J0 to , let mP () (resp. MP ()) be the smallest (resp. largest) eigenvalue of J~0(), and let
sP := inf {MP () - mP ()}
||=1
be the minimal difference the largest and the smallest eigenvalue of J~0() for  a unit tangent vector at P . We will establish the following result in Section 6.
Lemma 1.6.
(1) M is a space form, then every geodesic sphere is totally umbillic. (2) If every sufficiently small geodesic sphere is totally umbillic and if m  3,
then M is a space form. (3) If an irreducible symmetric space M admits a totally umbilical hypersurface
N , then both M and N are space forms. (4) If sP > 0, then there exists  > 0 so that geodesic spheres of radius less
than  at P are not totally umbillic at any point. (5) If M is a rank one symmetric space or M is a Damek-Ricci space, and if
M is not a space form, then sP > 0.
1.9. Radial conformal deformations of the sphere. Theorem 1.3 and Theorem 1.5 deal with points within the injectivity radius. Let S := (Sm, gSm) where gSm is the standard round metric on the unit sphere Sm of Rm+1. Denote the north and south poles of Sm by P± := (±1, 0, . . . , 0), respectively; dP± () = arccos(±1) and ± = . Let  be a positive real analytic function of 1-variable and let S := (Sm, ((1)2)-2gSm ). We will establish the following result in Section 7.
Lemma 1.7. S is centrally harmonic about the points P±. If S is not a space form and if m  3, then S is centrally harmonic about no points of the sphere other than P±.

1.10. A non-flat example with trivial volume density function. We will use Theorem 1.3 to establish the following result in Section 8.
Theorem 1.8. If m  4 is even, then there exists a Riemannian metric g on Rm which is centrally harmonic about the origin, which is not conformally flat, and which has 0 = rm-1.
Remark 1.9. Since the metric g of Theorem 1.8 is not conformally flat, g is not flat. Since any harmonic space with trivial volume density function is flat, g is not a harmonic metric. We will show in Section 8 that g is essentially geodesically incomplete in dimensions 4, 6, and 8.
2. The proof of Lemma 1.2: A leading term analysis
We use Equation (1.b) to assume n  7 in the proof of Lemma 1.2. We express Hn() = cn Tr{Jn-2()} + lower order terms. By considering product formulas, we see that the coefficients cn are dimension free so we may take m = 2. We set ds2 = dr2 + f (r, )d2 where f (r, ) := {r(1 + bn()rn)}2. We then have (r, ) = r(1 + bn()rn) so Hn(r) = bn() where r is the radial vector field pointing from the origin to   S1. We adapt an argument from Gilkey and

3. Proof of Theorem 1.3: Constructing centrally harmonic spaces

Let (r, ) be geodesic polar coordinates centered at a point P . Choose local co-

ordinates  = (1, . . . , m-1) on the unit sphere to express g = dr2 + gab(r, )dadb

and

P

(r,

)

=

det(gab(r,

))

1 2

()

where

d

= ()d1 · · · dm-1.

Let

r(r)

satisfy

r(0) = 0 and dr = (r2)-1dr. Let r(r) be the inverse function. We have

g = (r2)-2g = -2dr2 + -2gab(r, )dadb = dr2 + -2(r(r)2)gab(r(r), )dadb .

Consequently, (r, )  r(r) ·  gives geodesic polar coordinates for the metric g and r is the geodesic distance function for g. We then have

P,g (r, ) = (r(r)2)1-mP,g(r(r))

(3.a)

and g is harmonic at the point P as well.

4. Proof of Lemma 1.4: Space forms

We adopt the following notational conventions in Section 4. Let M = (M, g) be a Riemannian manifold and let M := (M, -2g) be a conformal radial deformation
of M. Let  and  be the Ricci tensors of g and g. If  is a smooth function on M , let Hessg() := 2 be the Hessian of  with respect to g;

Hessg() = 2 = {i j  - ij kk }di  dj .

(4.a)

Fix   TP M with 0 <  < P . Choose the coordinate system on TP M so  = (  , 0, . . . , 0). The following is a crucial technical result that will play a central role in the proof of Lemma 1.4 and of Theorem 1.5.

Lemma 4.1.
(1) If M is centrally harmonic about P , then M is Einstein at P . (2) g - g = -1(m - 2) Hessg() + {--10M - (m - 1)-2 d 2g}g. (3) L(i , j ) = -  -1ij + ij 1(). (4) Assume M and M are Einstein at  and that m  3.
(a) If L is not a multiple of the identity, then (  2) = 0. (b) If (  2) = 0, then (  2) = 0.

Proof. If M is centrally harmonic about P , then H2 only depends on  so we shall write H2() = H2(  ). In particular, by Equation (1.b), g(, ) = Tr{Jg()} only depends on  so g(, ) = c  2 and Assertion (1) follows. We refer to Ku¨hnel and Rademacher [9] for the proof of Assertion (2). If i > 1, let
i() :=  cos()1 +  sin()i define a curve in SP (  ) with  i(0) =  i . Assertion (3) follows by polarizing the identity

L(i , i ) =  -2 g(g, i  i, 1 ) =0
=  -2 (2i, 1 ) +  2(g,i i , 1 ) =0 = -  -1 + ii1 .

Suppose that M and M are Einstein at . Since m  3, Assertion (2) implies that Hessg()() is a multiple of g; if m = 2, then we obtain no information from the Einstein condition and it is for this reason we assume m  3 henceforth whenever using Lemma 4.1. Since  = ((1)2 + · · · + (m)2) and we are evaluating
at  = (  , 0, . . . , 0), we use Equation (4.a) to compute:

Hessg()() = {i j  - ij kk }()di  dj = {2ij (  2) + 4  21i1j (  2) - 2  ij1(  2)}di  dj = (2(  2) + 4  2(  2))dr  dr

(4.b)

-2(  2)  i,j>1 L(i, j )di  dj .

Suppose first that L is not a multiple of g and that (  2) = 0. We may then use
Equation (4.b) to see that Hessg()() is not a multiple of g. Since m  3, Assertion 2 then shows g - g is not a multiple of g. This contradicts the assumption that M and M are Einstein at  and establishes Assertion (4a). Suppose finally that (  2) = 0 and that (  2) = 0. Again, examining Equation (4.b) shows that Hessg()(  2) is not a multiple of g which is a contradiction; this establishes Assertion (4b).

4.1. Analytic radial conformal deformations of Rm. We adopt the notation of Section 1.6 for the remainder of this section. Let ga,b := (a + b  2)-2ge on the
appropriate domain for (a, b) = (0, 0).

Lemma 4.2. Let c = 0.
(1) ga,b and gb,a are isometric. (2) ga,b and gac-1,bc are isometric. (3) gca,cb are homothetic.
Proof. Let  =  -2 for  = 0 define inversion about the origin. Express  = r ·  and  = t ·  in polar coordinates where r =  , t =  ,  = /  = /  , and

CENTRALLY HARMONIC SPACES

rt = 1. We prove Assertion (1) by computing:

ga,b

=

dr2 + r2d2 (a + br2)2

=

t-4dt2 + t-2d2 (a + bt-2)2

=

dt2 + t2d2 (at2 + b)2

=

gb,a .

Next set  = c. Since r = ct, we prove Assertion (2) by computing:

ga,b

=

dr2 + r2d2 (a + br2)2

=

c2dt2 + c2t2d2 (a + bc2t2)2

=

dt2 + t2d2 (ac-1 + bct2)2

= gac-1,bc .

Asseretion (3) is immediate.

4.2. The proof of Lemma 1.4 (1). We must show that a radial conformal defor-

mation of the Euclidean metric defined by a linear function is a space form. Since

g1,0 = ge is the Euclidean flat metric, g1,0 is a space form metric. Stereographic

projection

shows

that

g1 2

,

1 2

=

4(1 +

 2)-2ge is the standard round metric on the

sphere of radius 1 and hence is a space form metric. The hyperbolic metric on the

unit

disk

is

g1 2

,-

1 2

=

4(1 -

 2)-2ge and hence is a space form metric.

Inversion

about the origin, which was discussed the proof of Lemma 4.2, interchanges the

region 0 <

 2 < 1 and



2

>

1

and

shows

g1 2

,-

1 2

is a space form metric on the

region



2 > 1 as well.

Thus

g1 2

,±

1 2

are space form metrics on the appropriate do-

mains. Any metric homothetic or isometric to a space form metric is again a space

form metric. Thus Lemma 4.2 applies to show gc-1d,±cd is a space form metric if c = 0 and d = 0. Set

c=

b a

1/2
,

d=a

b a

1/2
,

 := sign

b a

= ±.

We then have a = c-1d and b = cd. This shows that ga,b = gc-1d,cd is a space form metric. If a = 0, then ga,0 is homothetic to the Euclidean metric and is a space form metric. Finally by Lemma 4.2 (1), ga,0 and g0,a are isometric and hence g0,a is a space form metric.

4.3. The proof of Lemma 1.4 (2). Suppose that a radial analytic conformal
deformation N of Euclidean space is a space form and m  3. Since g and ge are Einstein at any point  in the domain of definition and since m  3, we may apply Lemma 4.1 to see Hessge () is a multiple of ge. Since ij1(ge) = 0, Equation (4.b) shows that (  2) = 0 and hence  is linear.

4.4. Proof of Lemma 1.4 (3,4). We must show that the metric ga,b has constant

sectional curvature 4ab. The metrics ga,0 and g0,b are flat and have sectional cur-

vature 0. We may therefore assume a = 0 and b = 0. The metrics 4(1 ±  2)-2ds2e

have constant sectional curvature ±1, i.e.

g1 2

,±

1 2

has constant sectional curvature

±1.

Thus

Assertion

(3)

holds

if

(a,

b)

=

(

1 2

,

±

1 2

).

Isometric

metrics

have

the

same

sectional

curvature

and

thus

by

Lemma

4.2

(2),

g1 2

c-1

,±

1 2

c

has

constant

sectional

curvature ±1. Rescaling the metric by a homothetic constant d-2 rescales the sec-

tional curvature by d2.

Thus

g1 2

c-1

d,±

1 2

cd

has

constant sectional

curvature ±d2.

The

argument of Section 4.2 now establishes the result in general. Since any two man-

ifolds of the same constant sectional curvature are locally isometric, Assertion (4)

follows from Assertion (3).

5. Proof of Theorem 1.5: Radial conformal deformations
The notation of Equation (1.b) for the covariant deformation of the Jacobi operator does not distinguish between the two metrics g and g. We evaluate at .

P. B. GILKEY AND J. H. PARK

Let , 1, and 2 belong to TM . We define the following endomorphisms of TM : g(Jk,g()1, 2) := {kgRg()}(1, , , 2; , . . . , ), g(Jk,g ()1, 2) = {kg Rg ()}(1, , , 2; , . . . , ) .
We emphasize that everything is evaluated at . We continue our discussion.

Lemma 5.1. If M is Einstein, if m  3, if (  2) = 0, and if M is centrally harmonic about , then (k)(  2) = 0 for all k.

Proof. By Assertion (4a) of Lemma 4.1, (  2) = 0 as well. Suppose the Lemma is false. Choose n  2 minimal so that (j)(  2) = 0 for 1  j  n but so that (n+1)(  2) = 0. We argue for a contradiction. Since M is Einstein, jgg vanishes identically for j  1. Since (j)(  2) = 0 for 1  j  n, we have jg = jg at  for 1  j  n and we need not distinguish the two. We may covariantly differentiate
Assertion (2) of Lemma 4.1 to see

{jg }() = j{g - g}() = 0 for j  n - 2 .

(5.a)

Since M is centrally harmonic about , Hg,,n+1() is a multiple of  n+1. Since M is Einstein, J0() = c  2 id. We use Equation (5.a) and Assertion (2)
of Lemma 4.1 to see that Jj() is zero and hence a multiple of id for 1  j  n - 2
(if n = 2, this assertion is vacuous). We may therefore use Lemma 1.2 to see that Tr{Jg,,n-1()} is a multiple of  n-1. In particular, Tr{Jg,,n-1()} = 0 if n is even.

Consequently we must differentiate the coefficients appearing in Assertion (2) of Lemma 4.1 to study n-1{g - g}(). We have

(n-1)g (i , i ; i , . . . , i )()

= (n-1){g - g}(i , i ; i , . . . , i )()

= -1()

(m - 1)n+1(  2) if i = 1

0

if i > 1

.

Since this must depend only on i , we conclude as desired (n+1)(  2) = 0.

5.1. The proof of Theorem 1.5 (1). Let M = (M, g) be an Einstein manifold of dimension m  3. Suppose that  is real analytic and that M is centrally harmonic about some  with 0 <  < P . Assume the geodesic sphere about P is not totally umbillic at . By Lemma 4.1 4, we have (  2) = (  2) = 0. By Lemma 5.1, we have (k)(  2) = 0 for all k  1. Since  is real analytic, this
implies  is constant.

5.2. The proof of Theorem 1.5 (2). We may work locally and assume without
loss of generality that M is flat space and g = ge. Suppose  is real analytic and that M is centrally harmonic about some  with 0 <  < P . We assume m  3 and use Lemma 5.1.

5.2.1. Suppose that (  2) =  2(  2). Express M = {N1,a}a where we set a(t) := (1 + at)-1(t). We then have

a(t)

=

-a(t) + (1 + at)(t) (1 + at)2

.

We solve the equation a(  2) = 0 to obtain

a=-



(  2) 2(  2) - (



2) .

By Lemma 1.4, N1,a is a space form. Since Na is centrally harmonic about  and a(  2) = 0, we may use Lemma 5.1 to see that a(  2) = 0 and hence a is constant so M is homothetic to N1,a and hence is a space form.
5.2.2. Suppose that (  2) =  2(  2). Express M = {N0,1} where we set (t) = t-1(t). We then have (  2) = {t-2{-(t) + t(t)}}|t=  2 = 0 and again we can use Lemma 5.1 to complete the proof.

6. The proof of Lemma 1.6: Totally umbillic geodesic spheres

The local isometry group of a space form acts transitively on the unit tangent

bundle of the geodesic spheres; consequently, the geodesic spheres in a space form

are totally umbillic. This proves Assertion (1). We refer to Chen and Vanhecke [5],

Kulkarni [10], and Vanhecke and Willmore [14] for the proof the converse assertion

to establish Assertion (2). We use Chen [4] to establish Assertion (3). Let ab(r)

be the second fundamental form of the geodesic sphere about P passing thru the

point r.

Chen and Vanhecke [5] show ab

=

r-1 ab

-

r 3

Rab

(P

)

+

O(r2).

Since

sP > 0, Rab is not a multiple of ab and show Assertion (4) follows. We use Berndt,

Tricerri and Vanhecke [1] to derive Assertion (5) from Assertion (4). The eigenvalues

of the Jacobi operator are given in the first Theorem on page 96 of Section 4.2. By

hypothesis, M does not have constant sectional curvature but the remaining rank

one symmetric spaces are included. There are 6 cases in the classification (i)­(vi).

In

cases

(i)­(v),

the

eigenvalues

of

the

Jacobi

operator

are

{0,

-

1 4

,

-1}

and

the

eigenvalue 0 appears with multiplicity 1 which yields the eigenvalues of the reduced

Jacobi

operator

are

{-

1 4

,

-1}

so

M ()

-

m()

=

3 4

.

The situation in case (vi) is

more complicated. Still, there is a 4-dimensional subspace where the eigenvalues

are

{0,

-

1 4

,

-1}

where

-

1 4

has multiplicity 2.

The computation of the remaining

eigenvalues

is

more

difficult.

Nevertheless,

we

obtain

M () - m()



3 4

so

s

>

0

as

desired.

7. The proof of Lemma 1.7
We adopt the notation of Section 1.9. The round sphere S is a space form. Since S is conformally radially rotationally symmetric about the north and south poles P±, S is centrally harmonic about these two points by Theorem 1.3. Suppose S is centrally harmonic about some other point. Since we are within the injectivity radius, we can apply Theorem 1.5 to see S is a space form as we have assumed m  3. This is a contradiction.

8. The proof of Theorem 1.8: A non-flat example with trivial volume density function

Let m = 2m  4. Let M := (CPm - CPm-1, g) where g is the Fubini-Study

metric. We have removed the cut-locus and consequently, the underlying manifold

is an open geodesic ball

of radius

 2

.

Choose 

so (r2)-1~ P,g(r) = 1.

Then

the

Equation (3.a) ensures ~ P,g = 1.

Then g(u, u) = (u)-2 so the curves (u) = (u, 0, . . . , 0) have length

-1(u)du .
u=0

Since

(u)

1 m-1



+ O(1),

the

unparametrized

geodesics

have

finite

length

and

the resulting manifold is not geodesically complete. We use Lemma 4.1 to compute

g((u)u, (u)u) = O(1), g ((u)u, (u)u) = (g - g)((u)u, (u)u) = (m - 2)(u)(u) + (u)(u)-1u{(u)(u)} - (m - 1)(u)2 + O(1)

A mathematica computation yields

g((u)u, (u)u) =

 if m = 4 
 
if m = 6



if m = 8

 

so this is singular at u = 0 and M is essentially geodesically incomplete.
