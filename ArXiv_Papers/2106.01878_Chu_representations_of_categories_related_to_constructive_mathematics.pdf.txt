Abstract
If C is a closed symmetric monoidal category, the Chu category ChupC, q over C and an object  of it was defined by Chu in [5], as a ∞-autonomous category generated from C. In [6] Bishop introduced the category P pXq of complemented subsets of a set X, in order to overcome the problems generated by the use of negation in constructive measure theory. In [34] Shulman mentions that Bishop's complemented subsets correspond roughly to the Chu construction. In this paper we explain this correspondence by showing that there is a Chu representation (a full embedding) of P pXq into ChupSet, X ^ Xq. A Chu representation of the category of Bishop spaces into ChupSet, Rq is shown, as the constructive analogue to the standard Chu representation of the category of topological spaces into ChupSet, 2q. In order to represent the category of predicates (with objects pairs pX, Aq, where A is a subset of X, and the category of complemented predicates (with objects pairs pX, Aq, where A is a complemented subset of X, we generalise the Chu construction by defining the Chu category over a cartesian closed category C and an endofunctor on C. Finally, we introduce the antiparallel Grothendieck construction over a product category and a contravariant Set-valued functor on it of which the Chu construction is a special case, in case C is a locally small, cartesian closed category.
Keywords: category theory, Chu construction, Grothendieck construction, constructive mathematics, complemented subsets, Bishop spaces.
1 Introduction
In category theory the Chu construction is a method of generating a ∞-autonomous category from a closed symmetric monoidal category (CSMC) (see [31] and [18]). The ∞-autonomous categories provide models for classical (multiplicative) linear logic (in [33]). The Chu construction was introduced by Chu in his Master's Thesis, and appeared first in [5]. The category ChupSet, Xq was introduced by Lafont and Streicher in [16] under the name of games (semantics for linear logic). In a series of papers, see e.g., [30], Pratt and his collaborators applied the Chu construction on topics of theoretical computer science (e.g., concurrency). The Chu construction has been applied to hardware verification, game theory, fuzzy systems, and the foundations of quantum mechanics (see [1] and [2]). There is a rich representation theory connected to the Chu construction, as many important, and quite different categories are represented (fully embedded) into some Chu category. The representation of categories related to constructive mathematics into some Chu category is a major theme of this paper.
In [34], p. 8, Shulman mentions that "a notion corresponding roughly to the Chu construction was already introduced by (Bishop and Bridges in) [8] under the name complemented subset". Actually, the notion of a complemented subset is already introduced by Bishop in [6], pp. 66-69, under the name complemented set. Here we explain in what sense Bishop's notion corresponds to the Chu construction. Namely, there is a Chu representation of the thin category P pXq of complemented subsets of a set X into ChupSet, X ^ Xq. Notice that Bishop's motivation for introducing complemented (sub)sets is rooted to his need to overcome problems generated by the use of negation in basic set and measure theory in a constructive setting (see [24], chapter 7, and [21]). Hence, the connection described here between the Chu construction and Bishop's notion of complemented subsets seems to be accidental.

All notions and results presented here concern cartesian closed categories pcccq, although they can be generalised to symmetric monoidal closed categories1. We structure this paper as follows:
∑ In section 2 we present the basic of the Chu construction and the local Chu functor.
∑ In section 3 we present the global Chu functor that corresponds to the Chu construction.
∑ In section 4 we present the standard and classical boolean Chu representation of Top and the induced boolean Chu representation of the category of information systems Inf.
∑ In section 5 we present the constructive normal Chu representation of the category of Bishop spaces Bis. This representation of Bis is the constructive analogue of the aforementioned Chu representation of Top. The notion of a Bishop space is Bishop's constructive, function-theoretic alternative to the classical, set-based notion of a topological space (see [20]-[22] and [25]-[29]).
∑ In section 6 and 7 we give the Chu representation of the category PpXq of subsets of a set X and of the category P pXq of complemented subsets of X, where X is a set equipped with an equality "X and an inequality X, respectively. All set-theoretic notions mentioned here are within our reconstruction BST of Bishop's set theory found in [6] and [8] (see [23] and, especially, [24]).
∑ In section 8 we introduce the generalised Chu category over a ccc C and an endofunctor  on C.
∑ In section 9 we define the generalised global Chu functor that corresponds to the generalised Chu construction.
∑ With the help of the generalised Chu construction we provide a generalised Chu representation of the categories of predicates Pred and of complemented predicates Pred in sections 10 and 11, respectively.
∑ In section 12 we introduce the antiparallel Grothendieck construction over a product category and a contravariant Set-valued functor on it, which has the Chu construction as a special case, in case C is a ccc.
For all notions and results from category theory that are used here without explanation or proof we refer to [17], [4] and [31].

2 The Chu construction over a ccc C

Unless otherwise stated, throughout this paper C, D, E are ccc and  P C0,  P D0 are object of C and
D, respectively. To show that the Chu construction in Definition 2.1 is category, one uses the fact the product ^ : C ^ C — C is a bifunctor (i.e., a functor). Moreover, if f : a — a1 and g : b — b1 in C1, then f ^ g : a ^ b — a1 ^ b1, such that 1a ^ 1b " 1a^b, and if f 1 : a1 — a2 and g1 : b1 — b2 in C1, then

pf 1 ^ g1q  pf ^ gq " pf 1  f q ^ pg1  gq.

(1)

If a1 " a2 " a and f 1 " f " 1a, by equation (1) we get

p1a ^ g1q  p1a ^ gq " p1a  1aq ^ pg1  gq " 1a ^ pg1  gq.

(2)

Similarly, if b1 " b2 " b and g1 " g " 1b, by equation (1) we get

pf 1 ^ 1bq  pf ^ 1bq " pf 1  f q ^ p1b  1bq " pf 1  f q ^ 1b.

If a, c, d, j P C0,  : a — c and  : j — d P C1, then

p ^ 1dq  p1a ^ q " p1c ^ q  p ^ 1jq

1A cartesian closed category C is a csms where its tensor product of C is its product and the tensor-unit is the terminal object of C. The category RelpSetq with objects sets and morhisms relations R  X ^ Y is a csms that is not a ccc.

If C is bicomplete (complete and cocomplete), then ChupC, q is also bicomplete (see [18], p. 41. The following result is standard (see also [1], p. 712). Proposition 2.2 (The local Chu functor). The rule ChuC : C — Cat, defined by

In the next two

definitions we

follow [30] and [13], respectively.

Definition 2.3. A Chu space pA, f, Bq in ChupSet, Xq is called separable, if fp: A — pB — Xq, where "fppaqpbq " f pa, bq,

for every a P A and b P B, is an injection. A Chu space pA, f, Bq in ChupSet, Xq is called extensional,

if fq: B — pA — Xq, where

"fqpbqpaq " f pa, bq,

for every b P B and a P A, is an injection. If pA, f, Bq is both separable and extensional, it is called biextensional. If B  XA and f : A ^ B — X is defined by f pa, bq " bpaq, then pA, f, Bq is called a normal Chu space. The Chu spaces in ChupSet, 2q are called Boolean.

Definition 2.4. If C is a category and  P C0, the affine category Aff pC, q over C and  has objects pairs pa, F q, where a P C0 and F  C1pa, q " Hompa, q, and a morphism h : pa, F q — pb, Gq in Aff pC, q is a morphism h : a — b in C1 such that g  h P F , for every g P G.

Next we fix some basic terminology.
Definition 2.5. Let C, D be categories and F : C — D a functor. F is an embedding, if it is injective on objects and faithful, and its is a representation, if it is a full embedding. If D is a Chu category and F is a representation, we call F a Chu representation. We call a Chu representation F strict, if F is injective on arrows. We call a Chu representation boolean pnormalq, if F0paq is a Boolean pnormalq Chu space, for every a P C0.



All Chu representations included in this paper are going to be strict. If C is in C1 such that for every f : a ^ b —  there is a unique fp: b — a with f

next result is also standard, and its proof is constructive. The normal Chu representation of Set

through ESet,2 into ChupSet, 2q is classically the "same" to the boolean Chu representation of Set

into ChupSet, 2q in section 4, which relies though, on the classical treatment of negation.

If G : D — E also preserves products and pGcdqc,dPD0 are the canonical isomorphisms Gcd : G0pcq ^ G0pdq — G0pc ^ dq, then G  F also preserves products and for every a, b P C0 we have that

The preservation of the units and compositions by F∞ are immediate to show.

If  : F Ò G, we cannot define a natural transformation ∞ : F∞ Ò G∞ i.e., we cannot show that F ﬁ— F∞ is a functor on the category Fun^pC, Dq of product-preserving functors from C to D. What we showed though, in the previous lemma is that the pair pF, q generated the functor F∞ : ChupC, q — ChupD, q. Next we describe an instance of the (generalised) covariant Grothendieck construction that defines the category with respect to which pF, q ﬁ— F∞ becomes a functor.

form  P C0,  P D0,  :  — F0pq is traditionally called an F -coalgebra. The relation between Chu

spaces and coalgebras is studied by Abramsky in [2].

4 Boolean Chu representations

The following Chu representation is standard. Recall that the category Top of topological spaces is not cartesian closed, and hence we cannot use Proposition 2.6 to represent it.

Proposition 4.1 (Chu representation of Top). The functor ETop : Top — ChupSet, 2q, defined by

E0ToppX, T q " pX, PX,T , T q,

is a strict Chu representation of Top into ChupSet, 2q.

Notice that although the proof of the previous proof is constructive, the definition of PX,T is classical. One can show classically that the Chu space pX, PX,T , T q is separable if and only if the topology T is T0. Clearly, pX, PX,T , T q is always extensional. The special properties of a topology T on a set X play no role in the above definitions i.e., this representation applies to more general categories. E.g., a classical Chu representation ESet : Set — ChupSet, 2q is defined similarly by

For all notions mentioned next we refer to [32], chapter 6. Recall that the Scott topology is Hausdorff, only in a trivial case, and hence it is not completely regular.

Definition 4.2. Let Inf be the category of information systems pX, ConX , $Xq together with morphisms r : pX, ConX, $Xq — pY, ConY , $Y q the approximable mappings i.e., appropriate relations r  ConX ^ Y . If s : pY, ConY , $Y q — pZ, ConZ, $Zq, the composition s  r is defined by

`



Aps  rqz :Ù DBPConB ArB & Bsz .

Moreover, 1pX,ConX,$Xq " $X. Let |X| be the set of ideals of pX, ConX, $Xq and SX the Scott topology on |X| that has the sets OA " tJ P |X| | A  Ju, where A P ConX, as a base.

To show that $X pX, ConX, $Xq — pX, ConX, $Xq we use the definition of an information system. To show that 1pX,ConX,$Xq " $X we use the definition of composition of approximable mappings.

Proposition 4.3 (Chu represenation of Inf ). The functor S : Inf — Top, where

`

is a full embedding of Inf into Top. Consequently, ETop  S : Inf — ChupSet, 2q is a a strict Chu representation of Inf into ChupSet, 2q.

If x P | $X |pJq, then J1 $X x, for some J1 fin J, hence x P J " J. If x P J, then txu $X x, and hence x P | $X |pJq. The equality |r  s| " |r|` |s| is straightforward to show. S is full, as if f : |X| — |Y |, then f " |rf |, where Arf y :Ù y P f A . S is injective on arr`ows; if |r| "`|s|, then r " r|r| " r|s| " s. To show that S is injective on objects, we suppose that |X|, SX " |Y |, SX and we show that pX, ConX, $Xq " pY, ConY , $Y q. If x P X, then txu P |Y |, hence txu  Y , and consequently x P Y . Similarly, we get Y  X. If A P ConX, then

AX " tx P X | A $X xu P |Y |.

As A fin AX P |Y |, we get A P ConY . Similarly, we get ConY  ConX. If A $X x, then

AY " ty P Y | A $Y yu P |Y | " |X|.

Hence, there is I P |X| such that I " AY . As A fin I and I is deductively closed, we get a P AY i.e., A $Y a. Similarly, we get $Y  $X.

As the category Inf is cartesian closed, then, according to Proposition 2.6, there is a normal Chu representation of Inf , which avoids classical reasoning.

5 Normal Chu representations

We have seen already the normal Chu representation of Set through ESet,2 into ChupSet, 2q. Next we present the normal Chu representation of the category of Bishop spaces. The notion of Bishop space is a constructive, function-theoretic alternative to the set-based notion of topological space, which was introduced by Bishop in [6], revived by Bridges in [9] and elaborated by the author in [20]-[22] and [25]-[29]. For the sake of completeness we give next all necessary definitions related to the proof of a strict Chu representation of the category of Bishop spaces.
Definition 5.1. If X is a set and R is the set of real numbers, we denote by FpXq the set of functions from X to R, by F∞pXq the bounded elements of FpXq, and by ConstpXq the subset of FpXq of all constant functions on X. If a P R, we denote by aX the constant function on X with value a. We denote by N` the set of non-zero natural numbers. A function  : R — R is called Bishop continuous, or simply continuous, if for every n P N` there is a function ,n : R` — R`,  ﬁ— ,npq, which is called a modulus of continuity of  on r¥n, ns, such that the following condition is satisfied

@x,yPr¥n,nsp|x ¥ y|  ,npq Ò |pxq ¥ pyq|  q,

for every   0 and every n P N`. We denote by BicpRq the set of continuous functions from R to R, which is equipped with the pointwise equality inherited from FpRq.

Definition 5.2. If X is a set, f, g P FpXq,   0, and   FpXq, let

`



U pX; g, f, q :Ù @xPX |gpxq ¥ f pxq|   ,

`



U pX; , f q :Ù @0DgP U pg, f, q .

If the set X is clear from the context, we write simply U pf, g, q and U p, f q, respectively. We denote by ∞ the bounded elements of , and its uniform closure  is defined by

 :" tf P FpXq | U p, f qu.

A Bishop topology on X is a certain subset of FpXq. As the Bishop topologies considered here are all extensional4 subsets of FpXq, we do not mention the embedding iFFpXq : F „— FpXq, which is given in all cases by the identity map-rule. The uniform closure  of  is an extensional subset of FpXq.
Definition 5.3. A Bishop space is a pair F :" pX, F q, where F is an extensional subset of FpXq, which is called a Bishop topology, or a topology of functions on X, that satisfies the following conditions: pBS1q If a P R, then aX P F . pBS2q If f, g P F , then f ` g P F . pBS3q If f P F and  P BicpRq, then   f P F

If F :" pX, F q is a Bishop space, then F∞ :" pX, F ∞q is the Bishop space of bounded elements of F . The constant functions ConstpXq is the trivial topology on X, while FpXq is the discrete topology on X. Clearly, if F is a topology on X, then ConstpXq  F  FpXq, and the set of its bounded elements

F ∞ is also a topology on X. It is straightforward to see that the pair R :" pR, BicpRqq is a Bishop space, which we call the Bishop space of reals. If X is a metric space, the set CppXq of all weakly continuous functions of type X — R, as it is defined in [8], p.76, is the set of pointwise continuous ones. It is easy to see that the pair WpXq " pX, CppXqq is Bishop space. Bishop calls CppXq the weak topology on X, but here we avoid this term, since in [20] we use this term for the Bishop topology that corresponds to the weak topology of open sets, and we call CppXq the pointwise topology on X. If X is a compact metric space, the set CupXq of all uniformly continuous functions of type X — R is a topology, called by Bishop the uniform topology on X. We call U pXq " pX, CupXqq the uniform space. If X is a locally compact metric space, the set BicpXq of Bishop continuous functions from X to R i.e., uniformly continuous on every5 bounded subset of X, is a Bishop topology on X.
A Bishop topology F is a ring and a lattice; since |idR| P BicpRq, where idR is the identity function on R, by BS3 we get that if f P F then |f | P F . By BS2 and BS3, and using the following equalities

we get similarly that if f, g P F , then f ®g, f _ g, f ^ g P F . Turning the definitional clauses of a Bishop topology into inductive rules, Bishop defined in [6], p. 72, the least topology including a given subbase F0. This inductive definition, which is also found in [8], p. 78, is crucial to the definition of new Bishop topologies from given ones.

Definition 5.4. The category of Bishop spaces Bis is the subcategory of Aff pSet, Rq with objects pairs pX, F q such that F  FpXq is a Bishop topology on X.

Consequently, if F :" pX, F q and G " pY, Gq are Bishop spaces, a function h : X — Y is a morphism from F to G in Bis, which is called a Bishop morphism, if @gPGpg  h P F q

We denote by MorpF, Gq the set of Bishop morphisms from F to G. As F is an extensional subset of FpXq, MorpF, Gq is an extensional subset of FpX, Y q. Similarly to Top, the category Bis is not cartesian closed. The following Chu-representation of Bishop spaces is completely constructive, and its proof is equally simple to the proof of Proposition 4.1.
Proposition 5.5 (Chu representation of Bis). The functor EBis : Bis — ChupSet, Rq, defined by
E0BispX, F q " pX, evX,F , F q,
5As in the case of BicpRq, it seems that this definition requires quantification over the power set of X i.e.,
BicpXqpf q Ù @BPPpXqpboundedpBq Ò f|B is uniformly continuousq.
A bounded subset B of an inhabited metric space X is a triplet pB, x0, M q, where x0 P X, B  X, and M  0 is a bound for B Y tx0u. To avoid such a quantification, if x0 inhabits X, then for every bounded subset pB, x01, M q of X we have that there is some n P N such that n  0 and B  rdx0  ns " tx P X | dpx0, xq  nu. If x P B, then dpx, x0q  dpx, x01q ` dpx01, x0q  M ` dpx01, x0q, therefore x P rdx0  ns, for some n  M ` dpx01, x0q. Hence,

since rdx0  ns " tx P dpx0, xq  nu is trivially a bounded subset of X.

` P CpX, Y q. One can show that ` P CpX, Y q, if Y is completely regular i.e., a Hausdorff space

Y such that every closed set F and a point y R F are separated by an element of CpY q. Let crTop

be the full subcategory of completely regular topological spaces. It is not a coincidence that such a

result holds (classically), as one can show classically that the canonical topology of open sets induced

by some Bishop topology is completely regular. From the point of view of the theory of rings of

continuous functions, the restriction to crTop is not a loss of generality, as for every topological space

X there is a completely regular space X such that the ring CpXq is isomorphic to CpXq. Actually,

crTop is a reflective subcategory of Top (see [14] and [35]), as for every topological space pX, T q

there is a completely regular space pX, T q and a continuous surjection X : X — X such that for

every completely regular space pY, Sq and continuous function f : X — Y there is a unique continuous

function f : X — Y such that the following triangle commutes

If pX, T q is a topological space a subset C  CpXq determines the topology T , if the weak topology of C i.e., the smallest topology  pCq that turns all elements of C into continuous functions, is equal to T . If pX, T q is Hausdorff, then pX, T q is completely regular if and only if  pCpXqq " T (see [12], p. 40). By the argument in the proof of Proposition 5.6 one shows (see [12], p. 40) that if C  CpY q with  pCq " S, then a function ` : pX, T q — pY, Sq is continuous if and only if g  ` P CpXq, for every g P C. A generalisation of the proof of Proposition 5.5 follows next. Its proof is identical to the proof of Proposition 5.5.
Proposition 5.7 (Chu representation of Aff pSet, Xq). If X is a set, the rule pA, F q ﬁ— pA, evA,F , F q defines a strict Chu representation of Aff pSet, Xq into ChupSet, Xq.

6 A Chu representation of the category of subsets

Next we present the categorical in spirit notion of subset of a (Bishop) set. Definition 6.1. Let pX, "X q be a set. A subset of X is a pair pA, iXA q, where pA, "Aq is a set and iXA : A „— X is an embedding (i.e., an injection) of A into X. If pA, iXA q and pB, iXB q are subsets of X, then A is a subset of B, in symbols pA, iXA q  pB, iXB q, or simpler A  B, if there is f : A — B such that the following diagram commutes

f

A

B

iXA

iXB

X.

In this case we also write f : A  B. Usually we write A instead of pA, iXA q. The totality of the subsets of X is the powerset PpXq of X, and it is equipped with the equality
pA, iXA q "PpXq pB, iXB q :Ù A  B & B  A. If f : A  B and g : B  A, we write pf, gq : A "PpXq B. The category PpXq of subsets of X has objects the subsets of X and morphisms functions f : A — B as above.

Since the membership condition for PpXq requires quantification over the open-ended totality V0 of predicative sets (see [24], chapter 2), the totality PpXq is a proper class. It is immediate to show
that f : A  B is an embedding, and that the category PpXq is thin.

Proposition 6.2 (Chu-representation of PpXq). If pX, "X q is a set, the functor EX : PpXq —

thus E1X pf q : A, IAX , 1 — B, IBX , 1 . Clearly, EX is a functor injective on objects and arrows, hence

an embedding. Moreover, by the the above triangle. Hence, if pf,

The category of subsets of X and its Chu representation are generalised to a ccc C as follows.
Definition 6.3. The category SubpC, q of subobjects of  has objects monomorphisms of C with codomain  and a morphism f : i — j, where i : a „—  and j : b „—  is a a morphism f : a — b such that the following triangle commutes

It is immediate to show that f is a monomorphism and that SubpC, q is thin.

7 A Chu representation of the category of complemented subsets

Definition 7.1. Let pX, "X q be a set. An inequality on X, or an apartness relation on X, is a relation

x X y such `that the pAp1q @x,yPX `x "X y pAp2q @x,yPX `x X y pAp3q @x,yPX x X y

following conditions

are satisfied: z X yq.

We write pX, "X , X q to denote the equality-inequality

structure

of

a

set

X.

If

` A,

iXA



is

a

subset

of

X, the canonical inequality on A induced by X is defined by

a A a1 :Ù iXA paq X iXA pa1q,

for every a, a1 P A. If pY, "Y , Y q is a set with inequality, a function f : X — Y is called strongly extensional, if f pxq Y f px1q Ò x X x1, for every x, x1 P X.

Remark 7.2. An inequality relation x X y is extensional on X ^ X.

Proof. If x, y P X such that x  y, and if x1, y1 P X such that x1 "X x and y1 "X y, we show that x1  y1. By pAp3q we get x1  x, which is excluded from pAp1q, or x1  y, which has to be the case. Hence, y1  x1, or y1  y. Since the last option is excluded similarly, we get y1  x1, hence x1  y1.

An inequality on a set X induces a positively defined notion of disjointness of subsets of X.

Definition 7.3. Let pX, "X , X q be a set, and pA, iXA q, pB, iXB q  X. We say that A and B are disjoint with respect to X , in symbols A X B, if

If X is clear from the context, we only write A X B or even A B.

Clearly, if A B, then A X B is not inhabited. The positive disjointness of subsets of X induces the notion of a complemented subset of X, and the negative notion of the complement of a set is avoided. We use bold letters to denote a complemented subset of a set.

8 The generalised Chu construction over a ccc C and an endofunctor

In order to Chu-represent categories like the category of predicates Pred and the category of complemented predicates Pred, defined in the following two sections, respectively, we generalise the Chu construction. Actually, it is this embedding that shaped the "right" definition of the category Pred,
as, at first sight, more than one possible options exist.

Definition 8.1 (The Chu construction over a ccc C and an endofunctor). Let  : C — C an endofunctor

on C. The Chu category ChupC, q over C and  has objects quadruples px; a, f, bq, with x, a, b P C0

The preservation of units and compositions by F∞ is immediate to show.
Next we define the appropriate category on which the generalised global Chu functor will be defined. Notice that this category is not a special case of the Grothendieck construction, but a variation of it.

10 A generalised Chu representation of the category of predicates

Predicates on sets were organised in a category that was called Pred in [15], in order to describe the logic and type theory of standard sets in fibred form. Here we present this category within BST.

Definition 10.1. The objects of the category of predicates Pred are triplets pX, iXA , Aq, where X is

a set and pA, iXA q is a subset of X. u : pX, iXA , Aq — pY, iYB, Bq in Pred

If is

pX, iXA , Aq and pY, iYB , Bq a pair of functions u "

22

In [15], p. 11, the embedding iXA : A — X is omitted for simplicity, and a morphism u is just a

function u0 : X — Y such that

@aPADbPB `u0piXA paqq "Y

iYB

 pbq .

It is immediate to see that to each a P A there is a unique (up to the equality of B) b P B such that u0piXA paqq "Y iYBpbq. By Myhill's principle of non-choice (or unique choice), introduced in [19], there is a (necessarily) unique map u` that makes the above diagram commutative. As this principle is avoided in BST, we prefer to present a morphism u in Pred as a pair pu0, u`q. It is immediate to see that if u0 is an embedding, then u` is an embedding, and if u0 is strongly extensional, then u` is also
strongly extensional. For a specific set X the "fibre" category PredX is the subcategory of Pred with objects triplets of the form pX, A, iXA q with X fixed, while a morphism u : pX, A, iXA q — pX, B, iXB q is a pair pidX , uABq, and the required commutativity of the following diagram

A

expresses that uAB : A  B. Hence PredX is identified with the category PpXq.

11 A generalised Chu representation of the category of complemented predicates

Here we organise the complemented predicates on sets that are equipped with a fixed inequality in a category Pred. Its subcategory Predse is formed by considering in the definition of the morphisms in Pred strongly extensional functions. The motivation behind the next definition is to get a strict generalised Chu representation of PredpSetq into the Chu category over Set and the endofunctor Id2 : Set — Set, defined by
Id20pXq " X ^ X,
Id21rIpdf21:pfXqs—px,Yxq1q:"X`^f pXxq,—f pYx1q^.Y,
This result is in complete analogy to the full embedding of Pred into ChupSet, Idq.

12 The Chu construction and the antiparallel Grothendieck construction
So far, we related the two constructions through the domain of the global Chu functor. The domain of the generalised global Chu functor has also some affinity to the Grothendieck construction. Next we discuss the relation between the two constructions themselves. A first result in this direction is the following result of Abramsky in [2], p. 14. Notice that instrumental to the proof of his result is a contravariant, or reverse, definition of the arrows in the Grothendieck category. Namely, if P : Cop — CAT, where CAT is the category of (large) categories, an arrow pf, q : pa, xq — pb, yq in the category GrothpC, P q, where x, y are objects in P0paq and P0pbq, respectively, is an arrow f : b — a in C and an arrow  : rP1pf qs0pxq — y in P0pbq. In the literature the standard approach to the definition of the category of elements or of the Grothendieck category is is the covariant definition of the arrow pf, q, where f : a — b and  : x — rP1pf qs0pyq. As we explain also later in this section, this reverse definition of the arrows in GrothpC, P q is necessary to Abramsky's result. Next follows the generalisation of Abramsky's result on an arbitrary ccc.
Proposition 12.1 (Abramsky 2018). Let C be a ccc and  P C0. If x P C0, let ChuxpC, q be the subcategory of ChupC, q with objects triplets of the form pa, f, xq and morphisms the pairs p`, 1xq : pa, f, xq —
26

pb, g, xq. If h : x1 — x, let the functor

where

If Chu : Cop — CAT is the

contravariant functor defined by

C0 Q x ﬁ— ChuxpC, q,

Chuph : x1 — xq " h∞,

then the category GrothpC, Chuq is the Chu category ChupC, q.

Proof. See [10].

The Chu construction can be seen as a special case of the antiparallel Grothendieck construction, or the antiparallel category of elements, on the product category, in case the ccc C is locally small. In the next definition we could consider a product C ^ D instead of a product C ^ C, and more options occur if larger products of categories are considered. If C is a category, a, b P C0, and S : pC ^ Cqop — Set a contravariant functor on C ^ C, let the induced contravariant functors

Sa : Cop — Set, Sapcq " S0pa, cq Sapg : c — c1q " S1p1a, gq : S0pa, c1q — S0pa, cq,

In relation to Abramsky's result, and for a locally small ccc C the previous result is maybe more interesting, as the functor S is only Set-valued, and not CAT-valued. Next we describe the global version of the functor Homp¥^¥, q.
