Abstract
In the light of recent experimental progress in determining the pressure and shear distributions in the proton, these quantities are calculated in a model with confined quarks supplemented by the pion field required by chiral symmetry. The incorporation of the pion contributions is shown to account for the long-range distributions, in general agreement with the experimentally extracted quark contributions. The results of the model are also compared with lattice QCD results at unphysically large quark mass.
Keywords: cloudy bag model, energy momentum tensor, pressure distribution, shear force

1. Introduction
A quantitative understanding of the nucleon structure in terms of quarks and gluons is one of the most challenging topics in modern nuclear physics. Many aspects of this structure are encoded in form factors, which means that their study is of vital importance to our understanding of QCD. The gravitational form factors (GFFs), which contain the basic mechanical properties such as mass, angular momentum and internal forces, are currently receiving a great deal of attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. There are three GFFs, which are related to the nucleon matrix element of the energy moment tensor (EMT) [6, 7]. The critical D-term form factors, which parametrize the spatial-spatial components of the EMT, carry information about the pressure and shear distributions experienced inside the nucleon [8, 9].
Theoretical developments connect the GFFs to the moments of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) [10, 11], which are accessible in hard exclusive processes, particularly deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS). Recently the quark D-term form factor of the proton at a scale µ2 = 1.39 GeV2 was extracted from a DVCS experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) [12, 13]. This led to the first experimental determination of the pressure distribution and shear forces inside the proton [14, 15] (referred to as BEG).
It is worth noting that, in order to extract these distributions, it was necessary to choose some functional form, in this case a tripole, to extend the form factor, D(t), beyond the limited range of momentum transfer accessible in the experiment. This does introduce some degree of model dependence into the results. This same D-term form factor was also used to derive the 2-dimensional transverse light front pressure density [16]. Most recently, the first attempt to extract experimental information on the gluon D-term form factor was carried out using the photoproduction of the  and J/ vector mesons near their respective thresholds [17]. While the individual quark and gluon GFFs depend on the scale µ, the total D-term Dtot = Dq + Dg is

scale invariant as a consequence of conservation of the EMT.
On the other hand, the GFFs of hadrons can also be computed from lattice QCD (LQCD). While the quark GFFs of the proton have been studied extensively [18, 19, 20, 21, 22], the first LQCD determination of gluon GFFs was presented very recently [23], albeit at a quark mass considerably higher than that found in nature, m = 0.45 GeV. The pressure and shear distributions of the proton were then extracted from the calculated D-term form factors [24], finding that the gluon contributions are dominant compared with the quark terms at the scale µ = 2 GeV. Once again there is some model dependence in these results associated with the need to assume a functional form for D(t).
There have also been a number of theoretical studies of the proton's GFFs. The MIT bag model, which is attractive due to its simplicity and incorporation of confinement, was the first to be applied to GPDs and EMT form factors [25]. This framework was recently extended to study the pressure and shear distributions inside the proton [26]. The first chiral calculation of the pressure and shear in the nucleon was carried out some time ago by Goeke and collaborators [27], using the chiral quark soliton model. For a recent formal study of the chiral corrections to the EMT we refer to Ref. [28].
Here we calculate the pressure distribution and shear forces in the proton using the cloudy bag model (CBM), in which the nucleon is treated as a three quark bag surrounded by a perturbative pion cloud [29, 30, 31, 32]. Like the work of Neubelt et al. [26], the calculation is motivated by considerations of large-Nc, where the nucleon is considered very heavy so that subtleties associated with the evaluation of form factors in the Breit frame can be ignored. Unlike the chiral quark soliton model, the CBM treats carefully the mass difference between the  and nucleon in the pion-baryon components of the nucleon wave function, which are crucial to obtaining the correct infrared limit.

V = (R - r), S = (R - r),

(2.2)

with R the radius of the bag. The terms in m (current quark mass) and m (the pion mass) break the exact chiral symmetry, leading to partially conserved axial current (PCAC). The quark and pion fields satisfy the following boundary conditions,

There have been very detailed studies of the structure of the nucleon within the CBM. The dominant components of the nucleon state vector are the bare three-quark bag with nucleon

quantum numbers, the nucleon bag dressed with a single pion, N, and the bag state with the quantum numbers of the  baryon, dressed by a single pion. The model provides a good description of nucleon properties from electromagnetic form factors [31] to the parton distribution functions [34], including nucleon spin [35, 36]. The N component of the pion field (omitting trivial factors of isospin for clarity) is

(r) = i gA 2 f

d3k u(k)  · k e-ik·r , 2(2)3 k2 + m2

(2.8)

where the form factor u(k) = 3 j1(kR)/(kR). For convenience,

we rewrite

For the  component of the wave function, in Eq. (2.9) we replace  by S , the transition spin operator, again omitting the
isospin operator (in this case the transition isospin operator) for
clarity. We also replace f (r) by f(r) defined as in Eq. (2.10) but with 2k  k2 +m2 in the denominator replaced by k(k +M), with M the 300 MeV mass difference of the nucleon and .
The symmetric energy-momentum tensor can be obtained

The quark contributions inside the bag are in agreement with Ref. [26], while the additional terms associated with pion contributions are derived for the first time.

4. Results
In our analysis, we take the current quark mass m = 20 MeV, f = 93 MeV, gA = 1.27, and the bag radius R = 0.8 fm. In Fig. 1, we show the pressure distribution and shear forces in the proton. They are compared with the experimental results for the quark contributions from BEG [14, 15].

largest negative value of the pressure at the bag surface, where the pion field is a maximum.
For comparison with the lattice QCD calculations [24], we also show the pressure and shear distributions for m = 450 MeV in Fig. 2. In this case, as the individual quark and gluon contributions are calculated at around 4 GeV2, we only show the total contribution of the quarks and gluons combined, which is scale independent. While the comparison with the contribution from quarks and pions only in the CBM requires some caution, as the model is valence quark dominated one may expect to reproduce the key features of the lattice results. Clearly, at this mass the distribution of both pressure and shear reported in the lattice calculation are much greater in the region beyond 1 fm than those found in the CBM. This certainly merits further study.

The LQCD result of Ref. [24] is

0.51fm2 using the z-expansion and 0.57fm2 for a tripole repre-

sentation of D(t) at m = 450 MeV. We find rm2 ech = 0.32 fm2

at the mass used in the LQCD calculation, while for the physi-

cal pion mass we find rm2 ech = 0.42 fm2.

5. Conclusion

We note that one should be cautious about a direct comparison for several reasons. First, there is some model dependence associated with the choice of the function chosen to fit to the experimental data for D(t). Secondly, the scale associated with a quark model like the MIT bag is low, typically [34] of order 0.20.3 GeV2, whereas the BEG data corresponds to a scale around 1.4 GeV2. Nevertheless, one expects that the model should reproduce the key features of the data. This is clearly the case, with the contribution of the valence quarks giving a peak in the pressure distribution inside the bag and the pions yielding the

In the framework of cloudy bag model, we have calculated the spatial-spatial components of the energy momentum tensor, from which we extracted the pressure distribution and shear force inside the proton. Compared with the experimental result for the quark contribution, the pion cloud, which peaks at the bag surface in this simple model, accounts reasonably well for the nonzero distributions at larger radii. Given that the lattice QCD results correspond to a much larger scale, it seems most appropriate to compare the total distributions with our model results. While the qualitative features are reproduced, there is

3

a clear quantitative discrepancy for radii beyond 0.8 fm. It will be fascinating to see whether this discrepancy persists in future lattice calculations.
The model calculations presented here can be improved in future work. Rather than using a static (infinitely heavy) nucleon one can generate approximate eigenstates of momentum in various ways. These will have the effect of smoothing out the discontinuity at the bag radius. However, such improvements will not change the qualitative features reported here, namely a positive pressure distribution in the interior of the nucleon associated with confined quarks and a negative pressure distribution outside generated by the pion cloud.
We look forward to the new experiments at JLab and the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) [37, 38], which will have much extended kinematical coverage and should provide more precise information on the gravitational form factors of the nucleon.
