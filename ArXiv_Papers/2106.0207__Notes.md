## Abstract

Magnetic skyrmions are stable topological spin textures with significant potential for spintronics applications. Merons, as half-skyrmions, have been discovered by recent observations, which have also raised the upsurge of research. The main purpose of this work is to study further the lattice forms of merons and skyrmions. We study a classical spin model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, easy-axis, and in-plane magnetic anisotropies on the honeycomb lattice via Monte Carlo simulations. This model could also describe the low-energy behaviors of a two-component bosonic model with a synthetic spin-orbit coupling in the deep Mott insulating region or two-dimensional materials with strong spin-orbit coupling. The results demonstrate the emergence of different sizes of spiral phases, skyrmion and vortex superlattice in absence of magnetic field, furthered the emergence of field-induced meron and skyrmion superlattice. In particular, we give the simulated evolution of the spin textures driven by the magnetic field, which could further reveal the effect of the magnetic field for inducing meron and skyrmion superlattice.
