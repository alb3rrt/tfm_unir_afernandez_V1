ABSTRACT Atmospheric heavy elements have been observed in more than a quarter of white dwarfs (WDs) at different cooling ages, indicating ongoing accretion of asteroidal material, whilst only a few per cent of the WDs possess a dust disk, and all these WDs are accreting metals. Here, assuming that a rubble-pile asteroid is scattered inside a WD's Roche lobe by a planet, we study its tidal disruption and the long-term evolution of the resulting fragments. We find that after a few pericentric passages, the asteroid is shredded into its constituent particles, forming a flat, thin ring. On a timescale of Myr, tens of per cent of the particles are scattered onto the WD. Fragment mutual collisions are most effective for coplanar fragments, and are thus only important in 103 - 104 yr before the orbital coplanarity is broken by the planet. We show that for a rubble pile asteroid with a size frequency distribution of the component particles following that of the near earth objects, it has to be roughly at least 10 km in radius such that enough fragments are generated and  10% of its mass is lost to mutual collisions. At relative velocities of tens of km/s, such collisions grind down the tidal fragments into smaller and smaller dust grains. The WD radiation forces may shrink those grains' orbits, forming a dust disk. Tidal disruption of a monolithic asteroid creates large km-size fragments, and only parent bodies  100 km are able to generate enough fragments for mutual collisions to be significant.

1 INTRODUCTION
A quarter to half of white dwarfs (WDs) show metal lines in their spectrum (Zuckerman et al. 2003; Koester et al. 2014; Wilson et al. 2019), observed at various WD cooling ages from a few times 100 Myr to several Gyr. Depending on the WD spectral type, heavy elements sink in the WD atmosphere on timescales of days to Myr (e.g., Koester 2009; Wyatt et al. 2014; Jura & Young 2014). In any case, the sinking timescale is much shorter than the cooling age, implying that accretion of heavy elements onto WDs must be ongoing.
Tens of elements have be detected in the WDs' atmosphere and the overall composition is similar to terrestrial planets (e.g., Farihi et al. 2009, but volatile-rich pollutants have also been detected Farihi et al. 2013). A widely-accepted mechanism for delivering such material to the WD is the accretion of asteroids (Jura 2003). During the host star's asymptotic giant branch phase, the central star probably has cleared all material up to a few au (Mustill & Villaver 2012). Thus, a mechanism is needed to deliver asteroids from larger heliocentric distances to the WD surface.

A promising candidate is the interaction with planets. A planet may scatter small bodies inward or outward. Generally speaking, scatterings with giant planets are strong and rapid ejection results. In contrast, less massive (multiple) planets, especially those on eccentric orbits, have a higher chance to scatter asteroids inward towards the central host and over longer timescales (Bonsor et al. 2011; Frewen & Hansen 2014; Mustill et al. 2018). As the central host star loses its mass during the giant branch, the interplanetary forcing relative to the heliocentric gravity becomes stronger, potentially leading to the system's instability and the planets' mutual scattering (Debes & Sigurdsson 2002; Veras et al. 2013, 2016; Maldonado et al. 2020a,b, 2021). These much-excited planets may then scatter the planetesimals to the WD (Mustill et al. 2018). In the meantime, a non-negligible fraction of the planets may themselves be engulfed by the WD (e.g., Maldonado et al. 2021).
In a perhaps less violent manner, planets may also send material to the WD through resonances. As the relative mass of the planet with respect to the central star increases owing to stellar mass loss, the width of the mean motion resonances becomes larger. Then objects previously not affected by resonances during the main sequence may become vulnerable in the WD phase (Bonsor et al. 2011; Debes et al. 2012; Frewen & Hansen 2014; Smallwood et al.

2021). Alternatively, ingestion of close-in planets by the host star may change the dynamical structure of the system, causing the secular resonances to shift and asteroids at locations swept by the resonances may end up hitting the star (Smallwood et al. 2018, 2021).
WDs in binaries show a similar occurrence rate of atmospheric metal signs to single WDs (for instance Wilson et al. 2019). A companion star allows for other avenues for WD pollution or enhances ones operating for single stars already. For relatively close binaries, during the stellar mass loss, the planet's orbit expands more rapidly compared to the stellar binary trajectory and may become unstable if it becomes too close to the companion (Kratter & Perets 2012). The differential orbital expansion may enhance the Kozai-Lidov (KL) cycles, forcing objects onto the WD (Stephan et al. 2017). Alternatively, engulfment of close-in planets may leave the previouslyprotected asteroids subject to strong KL effects (Petrovich & Muñoz 2017). Finally, the companion orbit may itself become highly eccentric due to galactic tide on the timescale of Gyr, destabilising the planetary systems (Bonsor & Veras 2015).
While accretion of asteroidal material seems rather ubiquitous, a far smaller fraction of the WDs, maybe a few per cent, possess dust disks within the stellar Roche radius, betrayed by an infrared excess (e.g., Farihi et al. 2009; Wilson et al. 2019). The disk is probably geometrically like the Saturnian rings (Jura 2003; Rafikov 2011b), formed through circularisation of tidal fragments of a large object inside the Roche lobe of the WD (Debes et al. 2012; Veras et al. 2014, 2015b; Malamud & Perets 2020a,b).
Several authors have looked into the tidal disruption of asteroid/planets around WDs in isolation (Debes et al. 2012; Veras et al. 2014; Malamud & Perets 2020a,b), without considering the existence of another planet that throws the object close to the WD in the first place. In this work, we bridge the gap and study the tidal disruption of an asteroid and the ensuing long term evolution of the tidal fragments under the effect of a planet, radiation forces and mutual collisions.
We organise the paper as follows. In Section 2, we model the tidal disruption of asteroids close to a WD and show how a ring of fragments results. Then in Section 3, the interaction between the tidal disruption fragments and the planets is under investigation. Section 4 is devoted to the collisional evolution among the fragments. Finally, we present the conclusions and discussion in Section 5.
Before presenting the details, we first clarify the terms used in this work. We are concerned about the tidal disruption of small bodies around a WD and the following evolution. For ease of reference, a small body, before its disruption, will be called an asteroid. After disruption, the remnants shredded from the asteroid will be referred to as fragments. Both asteroids and fragments, as seen below, will be modelled as ensembles of small particles. So particles will be used only to refer to the components of the asteroid.
2 TIDAL DISRUPTION OF SMALL BODIES NEAR A WD
When an asteroid comes inside the Roche of the central WD, it may be tidally disrupted (for instance Debes et al. 2012; Veras et al. 2014). In this section, we numerically model this process.
2.1 Methods
A number of works have looked into the disruption of an asteroid around a more massive object using numerical methods (see As-

phaug & Benz 1996; Zhang & Michel 2020, for early and recent examples). Here we model the asteroid as a non-cohesive rubble pile (see e.g., Richardson et al. 1998) and follow its evolution in the gravitational field of a WD. Our code couples granular dynamics with the Newtonian gravity1 as we describe below.
An asteroid is modelled as a collection of constituent particles. Each particle is represented by a hard sphere2 of its own mass, radius, position, velocity and spin. For simplicity, in the same simulation, all particles have the same physical properties. The particles' velocity and spin are affected by their mutual gravity and collisions and a kick-drift-kick leapfrog scheme is used to propagate these state vectors. In a kick, our code uses a brute-force method to calculate the gravity. The evaluation of gravity is not the main factor limiting the performance, as this is done only once in an entire timestep. Also in a kick, a list of neighbours for each particle is constructed. In a drift step, we first search for collisions in the neighbour list for each particle that would happen during the drift in accordance with Richardson et al. (2009); these are subsequently sorted by their collision time. Then if needed, sub-steps are performed so that the particles involved in the earliest collision are just touching. Their relative position and velocity at the contact point are calculated and the post-collision velocity and spin are derived using the coefficients of restitution in the normal and tangential directions as per Richardson (1994, 1995); Richardson et al. (1998). Now, a new search for collisions is done for those two particles only. We repeat this process until all collisions above-registered are dealt with. Then the system is drifted to the point where the next kick is due.
When processing the output containing the state vectors of each particle, a friend-of-friend method is employed to look for aggregates of particles (fragments). Here, we have used a rather small threshold such that the particles of the same fragment are more or less touching. We note that binary fragments, if any, are merged if their mutual distance is smaller than the Hill radius with respect to the central host.
2.2 A case study for a pericentric distance of 4 × 10-3 au
First, we perform test simulations to examine the performance/convergence of the code. The mass of the central WD is 0.75 M (solar mass), as appropriate for a progenitor star of about 3 M . Our three model asteroids are composed of 1000, 4000, or 8000 particles respectively, each of 1, 0.63 and 0.5 km in radius (the sums of the volumes of all individual particles in all three resolutions are the same) with the same particle density of 2.7 g cm-3. We assemble the asteroid by letting the particles free fall from randomised positions. In all three resolutions, the resulting asteroid radius is about 11.6 km, implying a bulk density of 1.74 g cm-3 and a porosity of 0.35. The nominal tidal disruption distance for these asteroids, according to Sridhar & Tremaine (1992); Rafikov (2018), is then 1.24 solar radii (about 6 × 10-3 au). Here for our test simulations, the pericentre () and apocentre distances of the asteroids are 4 × 10-3 and 10 au, respectively and the initial heliocentric distance is 0.1 au. The simulation is run for 1200 hr (50 days), far more than enough for the reaccumulation process after disruption, if any (Hahn & Rettig 1998; Malamud & Perets 2020a, and see Figure
1 The  -body part of our code is adapted from a program by Raymond J. Spiteri, as in the lecture notes of Parallel Programming for Scientific Computing https://www.cs.usask.ca/~spiteri/cmpt851.html. 2 A soft-sphere approach will not change the qualitative conclusions (e.g. Zhang & Michel 2020).

Figure 1. Snapshot of the tidal disruption of a rubble pile asteroid near a WD. The panels show the positions of the asteroid's composing particles projected onto the orbital plane at different times. The distance between the WD and the centre of mass of the asteroid is marked on top of each panel. The positions of the particles have been rotated for better presentation and the - and - axes have the same scale within each panel.

2). The exact restitution coefficients seem not important as long as the collision is inelastic (Richardson et al. 1998). For the resolution of 1000 particles, we have run 20 simulations with different random number seeds; among these, 10 are with the two restitution coefficients being 0.8 and the other 10 with 0.55 (Richardson et al. 1998; Zhang & Michel 2020). The resolution of 4000 and 8000 are computationally more expensive and we have only one run for each, both with coefficients of restitution 0.8. Our timesteps for the three resolutions are 3.8, 2.4, and 1.9 sec such that it takes tens of timesteps for a particle, moving at escape velocity of the asteroid, to pass by another particle and collisions can be sufficiently resolved. In the following, we refer to the asteroid of 1000 particles, radius of 11.6 km and restitution coefficients of 0.8 as our nominal asteroid setup.
In Figure 1, we show the snapshot of the disruption of the nominal asteroid. The left panels shows the moment when the asteroid is at its pericentre 4 × 10-3 au. Now, though apparently deformed, the component particles still stay together. Soon at 2 × 10-2 au, the asteroid becomes a string of particles under the tidal field of the WD. Moving further, the string collapses under self-gravity and a few tens of fragments form.
Figure 2 shows the time evolution of the number of fragments #frag (black, left -axis), the relative inter-particle collision intensity for all fragments coll (red, right -axis) and the distance between the centre of mass of all particles and the WD  (blue, right -axis) from a simulation with the nominal asteroid setup. The collision intensity records the number of collisions counted in a given time interval; this has been normalised by the lowest value so registered in the simulation. As can be seen, coll remains constant when the asteroid is far from the WD, as the structure of the asteroid is not changed. When the asteroid is close to the Roche sphere of the WD (the two vertical grey lines mark the enter and exit), coll starts and continues to drop, meaning that the asteroid is being shredded and the particles are drifting away from each other. But at this moment, the number of fragments #frag is still 1, so the asteroid's component particles are still pretty much touching (though not colliding with) each other. After leaving the Roche sphere, particles continue to separate under Kepler shear and #frag increases. But finally, particles

reaccumulate to form larger fragments under self-gravity so #frag decreases and coll increases.
The reaccreted fragments follow a distribution in their physical sizes and orbits. In the bottom panel of Figure 3, we show the size frequency distribution (SFD) of the above (20+2) simulations. The grey and black lines present the results with the asteroid resolution of 1000 particles, for restitution coefficients 0.8 and 0.55, respectively. The red and blue lines are for simulations with resolutions of 4000 and 8000 particles. Generally speaking, all these simulations of different resolutions/restitution coefficients/random number seeds are broadly similar though with a spread of a factor a few. It seems that the SFD can be approximated by a broken power, perhaps visually not so different from that of Debes et al. (2012); Malamud & Perets (2020b), steeper at larger sizes and shallower at smaller sizes. The distribution of fragments from tidal disruption events have been looked into in the context of near earth asteroid flying-by the Earth (Schunová et al. 2014). There, the SFDs were derived for the NEA population averaged for different Earth-encounter scenarios and a single power law applied.
In order to test the effect of the asteroid's size, we here perform two additional simulations. The resolution is kept at 1000 particles but the asteroid radius set to 116 km and 1.16 km, respectively. The SFD of the fragments from these two simulations are shown as the pink and orange lines in the bottom panel of Figure 3, both consistent with previous simulations where the asteroids are 11.6 km. The reason may be that the reaccumulation is controlled by the competition between the stretch of the fragment stream out of the tidal disruption owing to the Keplerian shear and local free fall (Hahn & Rettig 1998). A larger asteroid radius leads to a wider spread in the post-disruption orbits (cf Equation (1)), increasing the timescales of both phenomena, so perhaps these effects somehow cancel out.
The distribution of the fragments' semimajor axis  and eccentricity  are shown in the bottom panel of Figure 4 for a simulation randomly picked from the ten of the nominal asteroid setup. The black circles present  of the observed fragments, radii proportional to the physical sizes and corresponding to the left -axis. The two quantities are obviously correlated.

Any resultant difference between the orbits of different particles/fragments must come from the difference in their position at that moment. Suppose we have a particle/fragment and the differences in the specific energy  and angular momentum  between it and those of the centre of mass of the asteroid upon disruption, are

Now we follow the impulse approximation (e.g., Veras et al. 2014) to understand the result. The assumption is that the mutual gravity between the constituent particles of an asteroid becomes instantly negligible upon the tidal disruption and the frag-

Here  is the gravitational constant,  the mass of the central star,  the heliocentric distance of the particle/fragment on disruption, r the velocity component perpendicular to the position vector on disruption and  and  its orbital semimajor axis and orbital eccentricity post disruption; quantities with subscript 0 represent those of the centre of mass of the asteroid. On the right hand side of the equations, the orbital energy and angular momentum have been expressed in orbital elements (Murray & Dermott 1999). Also, because an asteroid's physical radius is much smaller than its orbital pericentric distance  <  , we have expanded the left hand side of the equation using /. From the above equation, apparently both  and  of a particle are uniquely defined by its , indicating a link between  and .
A closer inspection of Figure 4 suggests that the resulting fragments do not overlap with each other in the orbital space. This can be explained by a geometrical thinking (Tanga et al. 1999). Assume that the composing particles of the same fragment are also close together in the parent asteroid before the disruption characterised by its . Then large fragments cannot have the same  owing to the finite volume of the asteroid. Therefore, a fragment has a unique  which according to Equation (1) determines its orbital elements post disruption.
We have yet to determine the equivalent disruption distance 0. This 0 is not necessarily the pericentric distance (Malamud & Perets 2020a), nor has it to be the Roche radius (Sridhar & Tremaine 1992; Steinberg et al. 2019) so we fit it using the distribution of  of the fragments. A complication is that the asteroid radius  also plays a role. At the time of disruption, the asteroid may be deformed already and its  may not be the original value. But we simply assume that  is a constant, equal to the initial value. When 0 is obtained, we can plot a CDF for  and a  -  relation as advised by Equation (1), shown as dash-dotted lines in Figure 4. The agreement with data is excellent.
As a major aim of this work is to study how the disruption process affect the ingestion of asteroid by the WD, it is natural to ask if the fragments have different pericentric distances. Using /0 1 and 1 -  1 (the the orbits are extremely eccentric) and making some algebraic manipulations ofthe second line of Equation (1), it can be shown that (  - 0)/ 0  /0. Therefore, fragments of the same tidal disruption event have the same pericentre distances as the parent body. Finally, the dispersion in orbital inclination is tiny, of the order of  10-3 deg in our simulations.

2.3 Varying the pericentric distance
Until now, we have established the SFD of the fragments, their relationship between  and  for the pericentre distance  of 4×10-3 au. The outcome of the tidal disruption event obviously depends on  which affects both the orbital and the physical properties of the fragments (e.g., Schunová et al. 2014). Thus, we now perform a set of tidal disruption simulations with varying .
The asteroids are assembled the same as in the nominal setup. The restitution coefficients in the two directions are 0.8. The pericentre is varied between 2 × 10-4 and 6 × 10-3 au with an increment of 2 × 10-4 au, thus a total of 30 simulations.
As expected, a smaller pericentre leads to a wider of orbital spreading and faster stretching among the particles, inhibiting reaccumulation and leading to smaller fragments. The top panel of Figure 3 shows the SFD from our simulations, different colours representing different . From the figure, it seems that when  is small ( 1.5 × 10-3 au), the SFD is more like a single power law whereas when  is large ( 1.5 × 10-3 au), a broken power law provides a better fit.
The larger tidal field associated with a smaller  also results in a larger spreading in the orbits of the fragments. An example for  = 1 × 10-3 au is shown in the top panel of Figure 4 where the distribution of  now ranges from 3.5 up to 8.5 au. And the fragments'  spans a wider range range as well compared to  = 4 × 10-3 au in the bottom panel. We have in this figure, also plotted the fitted distribution of  with an 0 and the agreement with the data is fairly well. For two pericentre distances  = 2 × 10-4 and 4 × 10-4 au, a fraction of the fragments are ejected with hyperbolic orbits. According to Rafikov (2018), to eject part of the fragments from our test asteroid,  as large as 8×10-4 au may still be possible. Here from our simulation, it seems smaller  may be required.
2.4 Repeated pericentric passages
After a single pericentric passage, the fragments, formed by reaccretion of the parent asteroid's composing particles, attain different sizes (Figure 3). During the ensuing close passages between them and the central star, the large fragments may be torn apart to smaller and smaller pieces.
We model this process with our "long-term" disruption simulations spanning many orbits. In our previous simulations, the apocentre distance of the asteroid is 10 au, implying an orbital period of more than 10 yr. To model the gravitational and collisional interaction between thousands of particles for tens of years is beyond our computational resources (but the fragments may be analytically propagated when far from the WD; see Malamud & Perets 2020a). So here for these many-orbit simulations, we let the asteroid's apocentre be 0.4 au, the same as Veras et al. (2014). The corresponding orbital period is about 38 days and we track the particles' evolution for 800 days. Two pericentric distances are examined, 2 × 10-3 and 4 × 10-3 au, both leading to partial disruption during the initial crossing of the pericentre (cf. Figure 3). The other parameters are the same as our nominal simulation.
The bottom panel of Figure 5 shows the number of fragments #frag as a function of pericentric passages #peri for the two simulations. Take the black line for  = 4 × 10-3 au for instance. On the initial disruption #peri = 1, the parent asteroid is split into 40 pieces, consistent with that in Figure 3. Then upon the second passage, more than 200 fragments are created out of the previous 40. Further splitting goes on until after 6 passages, no fragment composed of two or more particle exists. The story is the same for  = 2 × 10-3 au,

The asteroid is initially composed of 1000 particles. The top panel show the orbital distribution of the fragments for  = 4 × 10-3 au at #peri = 1 (grey) and at 10 (black). The ordinate in the latter has been shifted vertically by 10-5 for better visibility.

the difference being that the final state is reached earlier owing to the smaller pericentre distance.
In the top panel of Figure 5, we show the orbital distribution in (, ) of the fragments at #peri = 1 (grey) and those at #peri = 10 when totally shredded (black); the two are vertically shifted for better visibility. The profiles of the two distributions agree rather well, the only difference being that that at #peri = 10 is somewhat broader. The agreement can be understood by applying the geometric analysis repeatedly to fragments from early disruptions.
Overall, because the size of the asteroid is small, the energy dispersion is small (Equation (1)). As a consequence, the fragments, after multiple disruption events, form a flat narrow ring (Veras et al. 2014), rather than an extended disk, as in the case of the disruption of a planet (Malamud & Perets 2020a).
The fragments being repeatedly ground to the constituent particles suggests that the final fragment size depends on the simulation resolution. Here our asteroid is modelled as a rubble pile where only gravity is at work and material cohesion is missing. In the solar system, asteroids 10 km are thought to be such rubble piles as often indicated by an lower limit of 2 hr of the asteroids' rotation period (Pravec et al. 2002). Such small asteroids possibly come from reaccumulation of parent asteroids after the collision (Walsh 2018). On the other hand, though this limit is also observed for much larger objects, gravity dominates over material strength so not much can be said on the latter (Holsapple 2007). Small rubble pile near earth asteroids have grain sizes from mm to tens of m with a power law size frequency distribution (SFD) with an exponent around 3 but the scattering is a few times 0.1 (Mazrouei et al. 2014; Michikami et al. 2019; DellaGiustina et al. 2019). While the large boulders are probably primordial from the collisional creation of the asteroids from the parent body, the smaller particles may have formed later via, e.g., collisions with small objects.
On the other hand, if the parent asteroid is monolithic, the internal material strength would counter-balance tidal fragmentation.

6 Li, Mustill & Davies
The larger the pericentre the larger the fragment that is resistant to further disruption (Kenyon & Bromley 2017; Rafikov 2018; Manser et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2021). Fragments of tens of m close to the WD surface or hundreds of kilometres close to the Roche radius, are expected.
Therefore, our simulation here suggests that rubble pile asteroids will be shredded into particles covering a large size range from mm to tens of m while monolithic asteroids will be torn into large km-size fragments. The fragment size has important implications on the collisional evolution as shown in Section 4.
3 ORBITAL EVOLUTION OF THE FRAGMENTS
In the previous section, we have shown that an asteroid, if plunging close to the WD, will be shredded down to small particles/fragments. Now we discuss the fragments' ensuing evolution.
How an asteroid gets to close to the WD in the first place to be tidally disrupted is not modelled in this work. Among the other candidates (e.g., Kratter & Perets 2012; Petrovich & Muñoz 2017; Veras et al. 2020), one is the perturbation by the planets in the same system (Bonsor et al. 2011; Debes et al. 2012; Frewen & Hansen 2014; Mustill et al. 2018). After the disruption, except for some (if any) on hyperbolic orbits (Rafikov 2018), the fragments' orbits continue intersecting that of the perturber. Furthermore, with pericentric distances within a solar radius, the WD radiation force may also cause significant orbital changes (Veras et al. 2015b). In this section, we model the evolution of the fragments' orbits under the perturbation of planets and radiation using the -body package MERCURY (Chambers 1999).
3.1 Initial condition
Our model planetary system is comprised of a central WD, one or two planets and fragments. The WD properties and tidal fragments are taken from Section 2. The assumption that the planet scatters the asteroid towards the WD implies a close encounter between the two right before the asteroid's disruption. Therefore, the orbital phases of the parent asteroid and the planet must fulfil some configuration constrained by the encounter, as we discuss below.
We first test a one-planet scenario. In all cases, the planet is revolving around the WD with a semimajor axis of P = 10 au. In "q2Q10R10-e0i0mN", the parent asteroid pericentric distance is 0 = 2 × 10-3 au, apocentric distance 0 = 10 au and its physical radius is 11.6 km. The tidal fragments from such an asteroid after the first pericentric passage as in Section 2, a total of  400 (Figure 3), are added to MERCURY, keeping the phase (e.g., the longitude of pericentre is 0). Those are treated as "small bodies" meaning that they are not interacting with each other. The planet's orbit is circular (P = 0) and coplanar with respect to those of the fragments (P = 0), and the planet's mass is that of Neptune. In this case, encounters between the asteroid and the planet can only happen at the asteroid's apocentre, so only one phase configuration is feasible.
In the second case, we adopt 0 = 4×10-3 au for the pericentric distance of the asteroid as this may change the frequency of accretion of fragments by the WD. However, tidal disruption at this distance only creates a few tens of fragments after the first pericentric passage (Figure 3). So we have randomly picked 14 out of the 20 simulations done for this pericentre distance as in Section 2.2. The fragments from all these 14, totalling about 400, are scaled so the total mass is the same as the other cases (though their mass plays no role here

as the fragments are treated as small bodies in MERCURY). This simulation is referred to as "q4Q10R10-e0i0mN".
When 0 = 10 au and P = 0 (the planet's semimajor axis is always P = 10 au), the asteroid's and the planet's orbits barely touch, representing a case of minimum scattering between the fragments and the planet. With a larger 0, there is substantial orbital overlap and stronger scattering may result. Here we simply let 0 = 12 au in our third case. Now, two phase configurations are allowed: the planet and the parent asteroid encounter when the asteroid is moving towards/away from its apocentre. This is our "q2Q12R10-e0i0mN" simulation.
Next, we change the asteroid radius to 116 km, which causes a wider spread in the fragments' orbits. This is our "q2Q10R100e0i0mN" simulation.
Then we vary the planet parameters. In "q2Q10R10-e6i0mN" and "q2Q10R10-e0i6mN", we let its eccentricity P = 0.6 and inclination P = 60, respectively. In the former case, the parent asteroid's and the planet's orbits may interact at different locations. In order to reduce the freedom, we let the two objects meet at a heliocentric distance of 10 au. Hence, the asteroid must be then at its apocentre but the planet's eccentric orbit allows for two phase configurations, it approaching/receding from the WD. For the latter case "q2Q10R10-e0i6mN", also two possibilities exist: encounter at ascending/descending node. And in this case, the fragments' inclination is measured against the orbital plane of the planet, when processing the output. Then in "q2Q10R10-e0i0mS" the planet is assigned a Saturnian mass. Finally, "q2Q10R10-e0i0mN+P2" represents a two-planet scenario. The second planet's orbit has a semimajor axis of 15 au and is circular and coplanar (such a configuration is long term stable, e.g., Gladman 1993). Its orbital phase is randomly chosen.
Now we move to the radiation forces which can be important for small pericentric distances. A WD's luminosity depends on its cooling age. At a cooling age of 100 Myr, the luminosity is very roughly of the order of one per cent of the current solar value ( ) (Veras 2016). Small objects with large surface area to mass ratios are the most affected and for those, we may assume a uniform temperature (Broz 2006). Hence, effects related to heat latency like the Yarkovsky effect can be omitted (Veras et al. 2015b). Then only the instant absorption and reflection of the incident radiation matters, which we refer to broadly as Poynting­Robertson (PR) drag (Veras et al. 2015a). It acts to shrink and circularise the fragments' orbits on timescales of thousands to millions of years depending on fragment physical size and WD luminosity (Veras et al. 2015b). For larger objects, the Yarkovsky effect may be non-negligible (Veras et al. 2015a); but the overall effect is anyway small because of their lower surface area to mass ratios.
Here we run two sets of simulations, incorporating PR-drag following Veras et al. (2015a,b). In both, the initial setup is the same as q2Q10R10-e6i0mN. But now each fragment is randomly assigned a physical size with its logarithmic radius evenly distributed between 1 mm and 1 km. In the two sets, the WD luminosity is  = 0.01  and 0.001  , representing a young and an old WD, respectively. The two sets are called "q2Q10R10-e6i0mN-PRY" and "q2Q10R10-e6i0mN-PRO".
All planet and asteroid parameters are listed in Table 1. These systems of WD, planets and fragments are integrated with the body package MERCURY (Chambers 1999) for 10 Myr. We have modified the code to implement a simple individual timestepping scheme so fragments very close to the central star that require very small timesteps do not slow down the entire simulation. The details are presented in the Appendix. In the simulation, physical collisions

In all the setups, the planet that scatters the parent asteroid of the fragments to the WD has a semimajor axis of 10 au; the other parameters are varied as below. The first column lists the label of that setup. Then in columns 2, 3 and 4, the asteroid's pericentric and apocentric distances 0 and 0 and its physical radius are listed. The following three list the orbital eccentricity and inclination and the mass (Nep for a Neptunian mass and Sat for Satunian) of the planet.

between the fragments and the WD are recorded; those achieving a heliocentric distance of 1000 au are deemed ejected. Additionally, for the simulations with PR-drag, we have also stored the shrinkage time that marks the instant that a fragment's apocentre distance drops below 1 au (then this object is removed from the simulation).
3.2 Orbits and fate of the tidal fragments
First, Figure 6 shows the orbital elements of the surviving fragments at different times in q2Q10R10-e0i0mN, q2Q10R10-e6i0mN and q2Q10R10-e6i0mN-PRY from left to right. From top to bottom, the three rows show the distribution of the longitude of pericentre , the inclination  (measured with respect to the planet's orbital plane), and the pericentre distance , all against the semimajor axis .
Clearly visible is that upon tidal disruption (time zero, shown in black), all fragments have the same pericentric distance and inclination as the parent asteroid, forming an vertically thin ring with perfect orbital alignments, consistent with Debes et al. (2012); Veras et al. (2014).
The orbits at 105 yr are shown in red. In the left column (q2Q10R10-e0i0mN), fragments with  > 5 au have been dispersed where their apocentre distances  = (1 + )  2 P. In the bottom panel,  of those outer fragments has been randomised and is just under the scattering limit (the grey solid line). In the meantime, those orbits become highly inclined with a few being retrograde. But the orbits interior to 5 au and decoupled from the planet do not evolve much. In the middle column where the planet eccentricity is 0.6, all fragments are within the reach of direct scattering by the planet and they are all randomised. In the right column where PR-drag is enabled, while the distribution of  and  is similar, there seems to be an overdensity at  = 180. Though, PR-drag causes no long-term orbital precession (Veras et al. 2015a) and we have verified this in test simulations.
Orbits at 107 yr are shown in green. Now, in addition to more scattering, vertical features in the (, ) plane of the left column show up. These are where the fragments' mean motions are commensurate with that of the planet and the prominent ratios are 3:1, 11:4, 8:3, 5:2 and 12:5, as shown with the grey dash-dotted lines. These commensurabilities seem to be stable and they can have sizeable libration width at such extreme eccentricity (Wang & Malhotra 2017). Meanwhile, the orbital alignment is now very much broken
MNRAS 000, 1­15 (2015)

in that the outer orbits are largely randomised whereas the inner ones show differential precession for q2Q10R10-e0i0mN. The middle and right columns show more extreme orbital randomisation, the main difference being that fragments are sparser in q2Q10R10e0i0mN+PRY because of removal caused by PR-drag shrinkage.
Next, in Figure 7, we show the fraction of fragments that hit the WD (solid line) and of those ejected (dash-dotted) and shrunk (dotted) as a function of time for different models. Take q2Q10R10e0i0mN as an example. The black solid line in the bottom panel indicates a similar amount of accretion per decade with no obvious decline. Such a trend is observed for all models, except for q2Q10R10-e6i0mN where there is a quick early accretion before 104 yr and perhaps another after 1 Myr. In general, within 10 Myr, 10%-60% of the fragments end up accreted by the WD. The most efficient configuration features an eccentric orbit for the planet (q2Q10R10-e6i0mN) (see also Frewen & Hansen 2014, though here the fragments are on WD-grazing orbits already) while the least is arguably q4Q10R10-e0i0mN. The top panel seems to suggest that consideration of PR-drag does not change the profile of accretion.
When the mass of the planet is small (of Neptunian mass), a much smaller fraction of a few per cent (dash-dotted lines) of all the fragments, or less than a tenth of that of consumed by the WD, are ejected. When the planet is as massive as Saturn (q2Q10R10e0i0mS), ejection and accretion are similarly efficient.
Finally, as the top panel shows, PR-drag shrinks the orbits of 40% and 20% of the fragments. Mostly, such shrinkages occur within a few times 103 yr, when the fragments' orbits have not been randomised by the planets and the pericentre distance  is small. Afterwards,  may be perturbed to higher values by the planet.
Not reflected in Figure 7 is that PR-drag depends on the fragment size and the WD luminosity. Figure 8 shows the shrinkage/accretion time of all the fragments as a function of their physical sizes. For q2Q10R10-e6i0mN-PRY ( = 0.01 ) in the bottom panel, fragments smaller than 1 dm are efficiently shrunk by PR drag on  103 yr timescale. In q2Q10R10-e6i0mN-PRO ( = 0.001 , top panel), the limit becomes 1 cm and in total fewer particles are shrunk. Later shrinkage is less likely as the planet scattered the fragment around and a small pericentre distance may be not maintained. The orbital evolution of larger fragments is dictated by the planets, leading to mainly accretion. Apparent in the plot is that the timing of accretion events shows a gap around 104 yr (this can be also see in Figure 7). Early accretion results from the planet directly

From top to bottom, the -axes are the longitude of pericentre , inclination  and pericentric distance  and the -axes are always the semimajor axis . The black (small dots), red and green symbols are measured at 0 yr (immediately after the tidal disruption), 105, and 107 yr, respectively. Also in the bottom-left panels, the grey vertical dash-dotted lines show the locations of some mean motion resonances with the planet (3:1, 11:4, 8:3, 5:2, and 12:5 from left to right); the grey solid line show sthe direct scattering limit where the apocentre distance of the fragments is equal to the pericentre distance of the planet.

scattering the fragments onto the WD whereas for later absorption, the fragments' orbits are first randomised and then scattered onto the WD. The top panel presents the inclination of the particle orbits at the moment of shrinkage, mostly very small especially for those of small physical radii from early shrinkages. This suggests that all those still share the same orbital plane, thus disk like when shrunk.
Finally, we briefly discuss the implication of the interplay between planet scattering and PR-drag among a real population of tidal fragments. As mentioned in Section 2.4 already, monolithic asteroids will be split into fragments of hundreds of metres to a few km, depending on the pericentric distance (Kenyon & Bromley 2017; Rafikov 2018; Manser et al. 2019). These large fragments are immune from PR-drag (perhaps except for WDs at very young cooling ages Veras et al. 2015b). The evolution of them are thus solely determined by planet scattering and from the simulations here, usually leading to accretion in the next few Myr.
If on the other hand, the parent asteroid is a rubble pile, frag-

ment of a wide range of physical sizes from mm to tens of metre result (Mazrouei et al. 2014; Michikami et al. 2019; DellaGiustina et al. 2019). Then fragments near the lower end (sub-dm) will be affected PR and the simulations show that their orbits will be quickly shrunk and circularised within the Roche lobe of the WD (Veras et al. 2015b). The larger fragments will be accreted onto WD due to scattering by the planet on Myr timescale. We leave the detailed discussion to Section 5.
4 FRAGMENTS' MUTUAL COLLISIONS
The mutual interactions between the fragments have so far been omitted. For such small objects with high orbital velocity, as we will see, because of the high relative velocity, mutual collisions can dominate over the gravitational forcing. On short timescales (perhaps over a few orbits Debes et al. 2012; Veras et al. 2014; Malamud

4.1 General trend

We have modified the MERCURY code to better detect collisions between small bodies using actual propagation of their state vectors when they are close instead of interpolation. However, test simulations have yielded no detection. Therefore, we resort to an analytical approach by Kessler (1981). The collision rate between two objects is proportional to the product of the collision cross section , the probability that both two appear at the same location , and their relative velocity col.

col   (, ) col (, ) 2 cos ,

(2)

where both  and col are a function of the heliocentric distance  and the vertical axis . In the derivation of Kessler (1981), it is assumed that the orbital phases are randomised (but , , and  are kept unchanged) and that the interaction between the two objects can be omitted. The first implies no azimuthal dependence and the second that gravitational focusing is negligible. The collision rate, when integrated over all possible locations of collision (radially and vertically), results in the overall collision probability between the two objects.
As a case study, we first consider the collision between two tidal fragments. Both orbits have a pericentre distance of 2 × 10-3 au and an apocentre distance of 10 au; their orbital inclinations are the same and are either 0.001 or 60. Here we only integrate the

The top panel shows orbital inclination when shrunk.
collision rate over the vertical direction so the radial dependence can be analysed. The normalised collision probability coll as a function of the heliocentric distance  is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 9,  = 0.001 in black and  = 60 in red. coll attains its maximum at the pericentre and decreases with  but there is a local maximum near the apocentre (Wyatt et al. 2010). The collision probability for  = 60 is lower by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, corresponding to the right ordinate, the black dashdotted line shows the scaled cumulative distribution function, i.e., probability of collision happening inside , for 0.001. It is clear that most collisions occur very close to the star (Wyatt et al. 2010), e.g., 70% inside 0.01 au (less than twice the Roche radius).
The middle panel of Figure 9 shows the the collision velocity coll for the two inclinations. coll is typically of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of m/s and is the largest at small heliocentric distances (Wyatt et al. 2010). At such high collision velocities, gravitational focusing can be safely ignored.
In the top panel of Figure 9 we have integrated the collision rate both radially and vertically and show the so-obtained number of collisions per Myr between two objects (each assumed 1 km in radius) as a function of the orbital inclination. Overall, collisions are extremely rare and the number decreases rapidly with the inclination and that at 0.001 is 103 times that at 1. We note that the formalism of Kessler (1981) is singular for a zero inclination, so here the lower limit for inclination is taken 0.001 (cf. Figure 8). When we work with the actual fragments from Section 4.2 in the following, if the inclination of a fragment is smaller than 0.001, we let it be 0.001.
A potential issue for our application is that, as in Figure 6 above, the orbits of the fragments may be actually highly aligned with pericentre pointing toward the same direction, clearly violat-

Figure 10. Collision configuration between two objects. The orbits of the two are coplanar and both have a pericentre of 2 × 10-3 au and apocentre of 10 au. The directions of the pericentre of the two are offset by . The top panel illustrates the two possible collision locations with the red (closer) and blue (farther) crosses when  = 10 (the angle between the grey solid and dash-dotted lines). The lower two panels show in solid lines the collision velocity and the heliocentric distance (left -axis) of the closer and farther collisions as a function of  in red and blue. In the bottom panel, the dashdotted line shows the relative probability for collisions between two objects with orbital misalignment randomly distributed between   (0, 0) (so now the -axis is 0).

ing the assumption of random orbital phasing of Kessler (1981). Nonetheless, as we show below, the collision probability so derived is correct to an order of magnitude.
In the top panel of Figure 10, we show an example collision configuration between two objects on coplanar orbits with the same semimajor axis and eccentricity but their orbits are mutually rotated by  = 10. The two orbital intersections, the closer one in red the farther one in blue, dictate where collisions are allowed. The heliocentric distance and the relative velocity of the two are a function of  as shown in the lower two panels. As  increases from zero, the closer of the two collision points starts from the pericentre and very slowly moves outwards while the farther collision point moves in very quickly from the apocentre. The two meet when  = 180. In the meantime, as the two orbits become more and more misaligned, the collision velocity increases and the closer collision is always faster.
The question we want to answer is if the orbital phases of two objects are random but the misalignment is confined to   (0, 0), whether or not the value of 0 affects their collision probability. For any 0, we obtain the heliocentric distances of the red and blue collisions. Then according to the above reasoning, should   (0, 0), closer collisions have to happen interior to the red collision (top panel of Figure 10) determined by 0 and farther collisions outside of the blue collision for 0. So we take the expression for the collision rate from Kessler (1981) and integrate it vertically but radially only in the inner/outer ranges. In this way, the collision probability for   (0, 0) is obtained.

The normalised probability for the closer and farther collisions is plotted as the red and blue dash-dotted lines in the bottom panel as a function of 0, corresponding to the right -axis. Both are roughly linear functions of 0. This means that if we have a given number of objects with orbital misalignment confined to (0, 0), their total collisional probability does not rely on 0. Therefore, the collision probability for (0, 180) (Kessler 1981) is correct in its value even if the fragments' orbits are not fully randomised. In addition, a closer inspection suggests that when the orbits are highly aligned (0 is small), red collisions and blue collisions are equally likely. This somehow disagrees with the case of   (0, 180) where collisions most likely occur close to the star (dashed-dotted line in the bottom panel of Figure 9). However, the difference is a factor of two at most.
A similar issue has to do with the "in-orbit phase". In the impulse disruption limit, all fragments are launched from the parent asteroid at the same location and at the same time. So their positions on orbit, the true longitude  +  (  is the true anomaly), have been the same at the time of disruption. How fast this quantity disperses can be measured by the filling time, the time needed for the fragments to fill out a ring (Veras et al. 2014). With a spread in  of  au, this is only a few tens of yr.
Above we have shown that collisions among the fragments are inclination-dependent. Collisions tend to occur close to the WD (chance of 0.7 inside of 0.01 au) at tens of km/s. Importantly, the analytical method of Kessler (1981) is valid even if the orbital phases of the fragments have not been been randomised.

Figure 11. Time evolution of collision probability among the fragments in different models. The fragments' orbitals are taken from Section 3 and fragments physical sizes are all 1 km in radius. In the second panel for the case q2Q10R10-e0i6mN, the red solid line is obtained where the fragments' inclination is measured against the mean orbital plane of all fragments whereas the red dash-dotted line against the planet's orbital plane.

4.2 Collision among tidal fragments
In the following, we use the above approach to calculate the collision probability for the fragment population from the simulations in Section 3. For each model in Table 1 and at every output, the collisional probability between each pair of fragments is analytically calculated using the method of Kessler (1981) where all fragments are assumed to be 1 km in radius. Then these are summed up and a total collision probability is obtained. However, in simulations including PR-drag, random physical sizes have been assigned to the particles and moreover the particles are removed when their orbits are small. This is inconsistent with the equal-size assumption made here so we will not calculate the collision probability for those two sets. The time evolution of the collision probability for the other models is shown in Figure 11.
Take q2Q10R10-e0i0mN for instance (black line in the bottom panel). The collision probability is the largest just after the disruption and drops very quickly: 2 × 10-8 collisions per yr among the 400 fragments (at time  = 0 yr and not shown in the logscale plot) within 104 yr timescale, it decreases to 2 × 10-9 because of the early loss of fragments and orbital excitation. Afterwards, the rate largely remains unchanged. This invariance seems inconsistent with the steady loss of fragments in Figure 7. The reason for this apparent incompatibility is that the total collision probability is dominated by fragments on low-inclination orbits and those are the inner fragments immune from long-term orbital evolution (Figure 6). We have verified that the overall collision rate corresponds well with the number of surviving fragments on low-inclination orbits.
The evolution of the collision probability in most other models follows a similar trend. The one that stands out is q2Q10R10e6i0mN, where the planet eccentricity is 0.6. Herein, multiple phases of decline are seen. Notably, a sharp plunge kicks in at a

few times 4 × 104 yr into the simulation and finishes at 8 × 104 yr, caused by a quick reduction of near-coplanar fragments.
Another system configuration needing comment is q2Q10R10e0i6mN. Here arises a question ­ in the collision rate calculation, with respect to which plane the fragments' orbital inclination is to be measured. In the long-term, the natural reference plane is the orbital plane of the planet, against which the fragments' orbits precess. Immediately after the tidal disruption, the fragments' orbits, though highly tilted as seen from the planet's ecliptic, reside actually in the same plane and are well aligned. The inclination in the collision rate assessment (Kessler 1981) acts to describe the actual vertical spread of the orbits. Therefore, we instead measure the fragments' orbits against the mean orbital plane of all fragments. In such a way, when the orbits lie in the same plane, the coplanarity is naturally captured, and when the orbits have been randomised by the planet, the reference plane will automatically approach the orbital plane of the planet. The collision probability so-obtained is plotted with the red solid line in the second panel of Figure 11. We have also performed another calculation where the reference plane is taken to be the orbital plane of the planet and the result is shown as the red dash-dotted line. As expected, the solid line predicts collision probability orders of magnitude higher than the dash-dotted line in the first few thousands yr than the dash-dotted one. But the two quickly converge within 104 yr as the planet-induced orbital precession is fast, with timescales of 103 - 104 yr.
The above collision probability, while capturing the time evolution, is not straightforward when assessing how likely a fragment pair is to have collided. Therefore, we integrate the temporal collision rate above over time and divide the integral by the square of the initial number of fragments. The result, shown in Figure 12, can be interpreted as the chance that a random pair of tidal fragments have (survived planet scattering and) collided as a function of time.
We again take the case q2Q10R10-e0i0mN as an example. Over the integration, the chance steadily increases at a constant rate and reaches  10-7 at 10 Myr. This behaviour is observed for many other cases where the chance at 10 Myr is  10-8 - 10-7.
Two models, q2Q10R10-e6i0mN and q2Q10R10-e0i6mN in the second panel are qualitatively different. The former (black line) is characterised by an initial instant jump and then it levels off immediately, meaning that collisions can only happen very early, before the fragments' orbits are scattered by the planet. For the latter, the reference plane can be the mean of the orbital plane of all fragments (red solid line) or the planet orbital plane (red dashdotted line). In the former case, the chance of collisions experiences an initial jump followed by a slow growth while in the latter, only the second phase is seen. As argued before, we believe the more proper reference plane is the mean of the orbital plane of all fragments so the case described by the solid red line is more relevant. At 10 Myr, both models predict a collision chance of  10-10.
The collision chance reported in Figure 12 varies by orders of magnitude for different models and we need to determine which model is more pertinent to an actual planetary system. Under our assumption that scattering with a planet is directly driving an asteroid towards the WD, probably the asteroid has to experience multiple scattering events and its orbit is likely inclined and intersects with that of the planet (Frewen & Hansen 2014). Also, if an instability among the planets themselves triggers their scattering with the asteroids (Debes & Sigurdsson 2002; Veras et al. 2013; Mustill et al. 2018; Maldonado et al. 2020a), the planets' orbits are probably eccentric and inclined as well. We deem that the models q2Q10R10e6i0mN and q2Q10R10-e0i6mN better represent the most realistic

scenario. For those two scenarios, Section 3 shows that the planets randomise the fragments' orbits on a timescale of 103 - 104 yr.
Now we discuss the implications of the constraint on the col-
lision timescale. Consider an asteroid of radius 0. Suppose the tidal disruption of it creates 03/3 fragments, each of radius . For simplicity, all fragments' orbits are assumed the same:  = 5 au,  = 2 × 10-3 au and  = 0.005 (see Figure 8). The timescale for a
fragment to collide with any of the others can then be estimated us-
ing Kessler (1981) as above. There is a one-to-one correspondence
between 0 and  for a fixed collision timescale col. The solid lines in the bottom panel of Figure 13 show 0 as a function of  for col = 103 (red) and 104 (blue) yr (beyond which mutual collisions become unlikely because of scattering with the planet). Take
 = 1 m for example. In order to have significant mutual collisions between the particles within 103 yr and 104 yr, the parent has to be at least 1.6 × 104 m and 3 × 103 m in radius, respectively. For
small asteroids, simply not enough fragments are generated during
the tidal disruption so col is longer. The size of tidal fragments from a monolithic asteroid depends on the material strength and the
pericentre distance and are in the range from hundreds of metres
to several km (Kenyon & Bromley 2017; Rafikov 2018) or per-
haps much larger (Manser et al. 2019). Likely the fragments have
similar sizes from the same disruption event. Then Figure 13 indicates if fragments are 1 km, only asteroids as large as 1.6 × 105 m and 3.4 × 104 m can generates large numbers of fragments that experience collision evolution in 103 and 104 yr.
The above assumption of monodisperse fragment size probably
does not work for rubble pile asteroids where tidal fragments are
single particles composing the parent body. In-situ observations of
a few near Earth asteroids have shown that the particles range from
mm to tens of m following a power law SFD with exponent close to

Figure 13. Collisions between tidal fragment/particle of an asteroid. In the bottom panel, the -axis is particle size and -axis the asteroid size. For a monodisperse fragment size , the parent asteroid of radius 0 gives rise to just enough number of fragments such that the mutual collision timescale is 103 (red solid line) or 104 (blue solid line) yr. In actuality, because the particle size follows an SFD (e.g.,  (1 mm,100 m), power law with exponent 3), the asteroid has to be of radius 1 (dash-dotted lines) so particles of  are vulnerable to mutual collisions. The black vertical lines show the limiting  below which PR-drag is effective for two WD luminosities (0.01 and 0.001 ). In the top panel, the -axis is 1, left -axis showing the total mass (density 2700 km/m3) of particles lost to mutual collisions (solid lines) and that of the asteroid (black dotted line); the right -axis shows the fractional mass of mutual colliders (dash-dotted lines).

three (Mazrouei et al. 2014; Michikami et al. 2019; DellaGiustina et al. 2019; Michikami & Hagermann 2021). So here we suppose the particles within a rubble pile asteroid follow an SFD with the power law coefficient of three and that the minimum and maximum particle sizes are 1 mm and 100 m, respectively.
Now only a fraction of the asteroid is composed of particles smaller than  with large surface area to mass ratios. Suppose that the volume occupied by these   particles is  03 and that the total volume of the entire asteroid is 13. The dash-dotted lines in the bottom panel of Figure 13 show 1 as a function of  for col = 103 (red) and 104 (blue) yr. Apparently, 1  0. For small , the difference between 1 and 0 is large, meaning that only a small fraction of the total asteroid volume is contained within those small particles susceptible to mutual collision. 1 > 0   when  = 1 mm (the minimum particle size), and 1 = 0 for  > 100 m (the maximum particle size). Concretely, for  = 1 m, the parent asteroid is now 1.9 × 104 m and 4 × 103 m for the two collision timescales.
Inversely, for tidal fragments (or the composing particles) out of a rubble pile asteroid of radius 1, only particles smaller than  with small surface area to mass ratios effectively contribute to the overall collision probability (for col = 103 and 104 yr) and their equivalent total volume is 03. Then we assume a density of 2.7 × 103 kg/m3 and calculate the mass contained within particles smaller than  as a function of 1, as shown in the top panel with the red and blue solid lines, corresponding to the left ordinate. The black dotted line (left -axis) shows the total mass of the asteroid; and the right -axis shows the fractional mass affected by mutual

collisions. Small asteroids are immune to mutual collisions among the fragment particles. When 1 < 104 m and < 5×103 m, the mass lost to collision within col = 103 yr and 104 yr only comprises a negligible fraction of the asteroid mass. The transition to the dominance of collision is rather quick ­ for asteroids of 1.6 × 104 and < 7 × 103 m, essentially all asteroid materials suffer from collision in the two cases. The absolute mass of that experience active collisional evolution may vary by orders of magnitude.
4.3 Synergy between fragment mutual collisions and PR-drag
As shown in Section 4.1, the mutual collisions among the tidal fragments occur at relative velocities of tens of km/s higher (see also Wyatt et al. 2010). Such collisions are probably super-catastrophic, leaving no collisional fragments larger than a tenth of the parent body (e.g., Benz & Asphaug 1999; Leinhardt & Stewart 2012). These second generation fragment may be subject to further mutual collision.
Among a population of  fragments, the timescale for one to collide with any of the other is inversely proportional to the total collision cross section, or equivalently, proportional to  -1-2 ( is the radius of a fragment). After one collision, consider a simple case where the fragments are split into ten equal mass pieces. The collision timescale between these second generation fragments would be 10-1 (0.11/3)-2  0.5 times that among the progenitor bodies. Hence, the mutual collisions among the collisional fragments have exponentially shorter and shorter timescales ­ the fragments will be ground down to tidal dust particles if the timescale of the zeroth generation fragments (the tidal fragments) is shorter than the planet scattering timescale.
Here in the discussion above, we have only addressed cases where PR-drag is inactivated. But what if this effect is at work? As shown in that Section 3 (and see also Veras et al. 2015b), PRdrag serves to shrink the fragments' orbits but is only efficient for small objects. While large tidal fragments are not affected directly, if mutual collisions are triggered, their collisional fragments may be prone to this effect. As these second-generation fragments' orbits contract, their mutual collision timescale also decreases because of the faster orbital revolution. This may further accelerate the collision process, in addition to the increase of collision cross section as discussed above. Hence, it seems that fragments' mutual collisions tend to occur in a run away manner, perhaps leading to the formation of a dust disk (Veras et al. 2015b).
5 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
We have studied the tidal disruption of an asteroid by a WD in its Roche lobe and the ensuing evolution of the fragments. Modelled as a rubble pile and on an extremely eccentric orbit, the asteroid is shredded by the WD tidal field into its constituent particles after a few pericentric passages, resulting in a flat and aligned ring of particles. In assessing the fragment particles' long term evolution, we have considered the perturbation from the planet that is responsible for scattering the asteroid close to the WD, radiation forces (PR-drag) by the WD and the fragments' mutual collisions. We find that depending on the planet's orbit and mass, it scatters the fragments' orbits on timescale of 103 - 104 yr, breaking the alignment and coplanarity. Scattered around the system, tens of per cent of the fragments are accreted by the WD over a few Myr. Radiation forces work on small sub-cm or -dm particles only and shrink their orbits efficiently within 103 - 104 yr before the planet (stochastically)

Accretion of asteroids onto white dwarfs 13
raises the pericentre distance. Active fragment mutual collisions depend crucially on coplanarity and are hence only relevant before the fragments' orbits are scattered by the planet. Assuming that an asteroid is split into equal-size fragments, we show that only large enough parent asteroids can create enough fragments such that collisions are important within 103 - 104 yr. For example, if the fragment size is 1 m, the asteroid has to be > 3 km in radius and larger fragment sizes require larger asteroids. Then we have tested an SFD typical of near Earth asteroids and find that only for asteroids > 10 km, a substantial fraction of the asteroids' mass is subject to mutual collisions. At tens of km/s or more, the mutual collisions may effectively grind down the tidal fragments on short timescales and once the collisional fragments are small enough, PR-drag kicks in and a circumstellar disk results.
Based on the above result, we propose that the tidal disruption of an asteroid around a WD and the long term evolution of the fragments depends on the asteroid properties.
· During the tidal disruption, monolithic asteroids are broken down into pieces that can withstand the WD tide. Depending on the material strength, the resulting fragments are km sized or much larger (Kenyon & Bromley 2017; Rafikov 2018; Manser et al. 2019). These large objects have small surface area to mass ratios and are not affected by radiation forces (Veras et al. 2015b, and see Figure 8). Whether mutual collisions can come into play relies on the parent asteroid size.
­ If the asteroid is small, 100 km in radius (bottom panel of Figure 13), simply not enough fragments are created and the collision timescale is longer than a few 103 - 104 yr. The fragments' long term evolution will be dominated by the interaction with the planet that scatters the parent asteroid to the WD and over Myr timescale, a few tens of per cent of them end up accreted by the WD (Figure 7).
­ If the asteroid is large 100 km in radius, high speed disruptive mutual collisions among the tidal fragments are expected to happen within 103 - 104 yr. Then, collisions among these collisional fragments will occur on shorter and shorter timescales, generating large amount of small dust particles. The orbits of these small objects, under the effect of PR-drag, shrink, leading to a dust disk inside the WD Roche lobe (Veras et al. 2015b).
· Rubble pile asteroids are shredded into the constituent particles during the tidal disruption. Those particles cover a large range from mm to tens of m (Mazrouei et al. 2014; Michikami et al. 2019; DellaGiustina et al. 2019). The smallest particles are directly affected by PR-drag but only constitute < 10% of the asteroid total mass (top panel of Figure 13). Whether particle mutual collisions are important within 103 - 104 yr again depends on the asteroid size.
­ If the asteroid is small, 10 km in radius (top panel of Figure 13), a small fraction of the asteroid mass contained with small particles are subject to mutual collisions, later converted into a dust disk with the help of PR-drag. The majority of the asteroid mass will then be controlled by the scattering with the planet.
­ If the asteroid is large 10 km in radius, all its constituent particles participate in the mutual collisions and the formation of a disk.
How does direct accretion of the fragments from an asteroid due to sporadic scattering by the planet compare with accretion from a disk formed from an asteroid? While the accretion timescale

14 Li, Mustill & Davies
of the former is as shown here several Myr, accretion from a disk, perhaps through PR-drag and aerodynamic drag, is much quicker of the order of 105 yr (Rafikov 2011b,a). In addition, as we have shown, only massive asteroids can lead to the formation of disks. Then accretion from a disk formed out of a (massive) asteroid is higher than that directly from an (average) asteroid, not inconsistent with the fact that faster accreting WDs have a higher disk occurrence rate (Farihi et al. 2009). We note that here we have only discussed the isolated accretion from a single body whereas in a population of asteroids, another object could enter the Roche radius before a previous one is accreted (in many My) (Mustill et al. 2018) and a disk may be replenished by traversing objects (Malamud et al. 2021).
While a few tens of per cent of the WDs are actively accreting asteroidal material, only a tenth of those accreting have dust disks (e.g., Farihi et al. 2009). We have shown that only large enough asteroids can initiate mutual collisions between the tidal fragments and lead to the formation of a disk before planet scattering dominates. In the solar system, asteroids 10 km are probably rubble piles (e.g., Bottke et al. 2005; Walsh 2018), but those are too small to trigger fragments' mutual collisions. Larger asteroids are likely monolithic. But for those, a larger radius  100 km is required for the formation of a dust disk. Hence, it seems that in the solar system, whether of rubble pile or monolithic nature, tidal disruption of asteroids 100 km will lead to a dust disk and otherwise not. The main belt asteroids are highly top heavy: only a few tens of them are larger than the 100 km threshold. Combined, this suggests that the rarity of disk comes from the rarity of large asteroids (and the short lifetime of a disk Rafikov 2011b).
In multiple-planet systems, depending on the architecture, a few to tens of per cent of unstable planets can be driven to pass within the WD Roche radius (Debes & Sigurdsson 2002; Veras et al. 2013, 2016; Maldonado et al. 2020a,b, 2021). The tidal disruption of these large objects should lead to the formation of a disk as well.
We have not considered the production of gas. Mutual fragment collisions occur at velocity of tens of km/s where tens of per cent of the colliders may vapourise (Kenyon & Bromley 2017; Malamud et al. 2021). Moreover, WD radiation may sublimate the dust particles directly (Rafikov 2011b,a; Steckloff et al. 2021). Otherwise, gas could be released from an asteroid made of strong material within the Roche radius (Trevascus et al. 2021). We refer to Malamud et al. (2021) for an extended discussion on this matter.
Here we have only considered the synergy between WD radiation and the mutual collisions between the tidal fragments. Other orbital shrinkage mechanisms, (e.g., O'Connor et al. 2020; Malamud et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2021) that are size dependent may also benefit from the collisional grinding. Similarly, the planet scattering timescale sets a limit to all these effects.
In our scenario, it is the direct scattering between the tidal fragments and a planet that puts a limit on the collisional evolution of the former. However, if the asteroid is pushed towards the WD's Roche radius through secular forcing (for instance Kratter & Perets 2012; Stephan et al. 2017; Petrovich & Muñoz 2017), perhaps such a timescale constraint would be greatly relieved. Then, the fragments would have more time to interact with one another and the chance of disk production could be increased.
In summary, our work shows that not all accretion of asteroidal material onto WDs takes place through a disk, the occurrence rate of which depends on the asteroid's size and internal properties

Accretion of asteroids onto white dwarfs 15

APPENDIX A: INDIVIDUAL TIME-STEPPING
The original MERCURY package uses a global timestep. This timestep is limited by the objects that are close to the central star, potentially slowing down the simulation. In order to alleviate this issue, we simply introduce subsystems containing only fragments close to the WD. For any object achieving a stellar-centric distance smaller than a critical value crit, a subsystem is spawned. Herein, only the star, the planets (big bodies as in MERCURY Chambers 1999) and this fragment (as a small body) are considered; this subsystem is propagated in isolation and until the heliocentric distance of the fragment is large again, it collides with the central star, or an output is due. Then the fragment is passed back to the main simulation for further integration, logging the collision or normal output. In the last scenario, the fragment continues to be simulated in a subsystem after the output. When multiple fragments are close to the star, more than one subsystems are created and are dealt with simultaneously. The Bulirsch-Stoer integrator (Press et al. 1992) is used for the simulation of the subsystems. Test simulations show that, for a system of a few hundreds of fragments, our revision offers a speedup of a factor of a few for crit around a few time 0.1 au to 1 au. In the simulation in the main body of the paper, we let crit = 0.5 au.
