## Abstract

The structural and magnetic properties of Y$_{0.9}$Pr$_{0.1}$Fe$_2$D$_{3.5}$ deuteride have been investigated by synchrotron and neutron diffraction, magnetic measurements, and differential scanning calorimetry. Deuterium insertion induces a 23.5 % cell volume increase and a lowering of crystal symmetry compared to the cubic C15 parent compound (Fd-3m SG). The deuteride is monoclinic (P21/c SG) below 330 K and undergoes a first order transition between 330 and 350 K towards a pseudo-cubic structure (R-3m SG) with TO-D = 342(2) K. The compound is ferromagnetic, accompanied by a magnetostrictive effect below TC = 274 K. The analysis of the critical exponents indicates a second order type transition with a deviation from the isotropic 3D Heisenberg model towards the 3D XY model. This implies an easy plane of magnetization in agreement with cell parameter variation showing a planar magnetic orientation. A weak magnetic peak is even observed at the order-disorder transition with a maximum at 343 K. Magnetic entropy variations are characteristic of direct and reverse magnetocaloric effects at TC and TO-D respectively.
