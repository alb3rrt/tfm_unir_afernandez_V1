Abstract: We initiate a study of the holographic duals of a class of four-dimensional N = 2 superconformal field theories that are engineered by wrapping M5-branes on a sphere with an irregular puncture. These notably include the strongly-coupled field theories of ArgyresDouglas type. Our solutions are obtained in 7d gauged supergravity, where they take the form of a warped product of AdS5 and a "half-spindle." The irregular puncture is modeled by a localized M5-brane source in the internal space of the gravity duals. Our solutions feature a realization of supersymmetry that is distinct from the usual topological twist, as well as an interesting Stückelberg mechanism involving the gauge field associated to a generator of the isometry algebra of the internal space. We check the proposed duality by computing the holographic central charge, the flavor symmetry central charge, and the dimensions of various supersymmetric probe M2-branes, and matching these with the dual Argyres-Douglas field theories. Furthermore, we compute the large-N 't Hooft anomalies of the field theories using anomaly inflow methods in M-theory, and find perfect agreement with the proposed duality.

1 Introduction
The Argyres-Douglas (AD) field theories have particular significance among four-dimensional N = 2 superconformal field theories (SCFTs). As in the original such theory discovered by Argyres and Douglas in [1], many of these SCFTs appear at special singular points on the moduli space of N = 2 gauge theories where mutually non-local dyons simultaneously become massless [2, 3]. Such phenomena cannot be captured by a Lagrangian in the traditional sense, and thus these theories are intrinsically strongly coupled. Nonetheless, the existence of an interacting superconformal fixed point has been convincingly argued from both field theoretic and string theoretic perspectives.

Several features of the Argyres-Douglas theories set them apart. A dramatic example is

that they possess relevant chiral operators in their spectrum with fractional scaling dimensions.

in

this

sense

the "minimal" N = 2 SCFT is of Argyres-Douglas type [4].

Argyres-Douglas SCFTs also appear in the low-energy limit of various string theory con-

figurations via geometric engineering. One such realization involves compactifying the 6d

N = (2, 0) SCFTs of g =ADE type on a punctured sphere, which for g = AN-1 corresponds to N M5-branes wrapped on the sphere. An infinite class of four-dimensional conformal field

theories with varying amounts of supersymmetry can be obtained by compactifying the (2,0)

theories on a punctured Riemann surface, while employing a topological twist to preserve

supersymmetry in four dimensions, beginning with the N = 2 constructions in [5­7]. A large

subset of Argyres-Douglas theories can be thus obtained in the very special case that the Rie-

mann surface is a sphere with a puncture of irregular, rather than regular, type [8­10] (also

see [7, 11]). While the holographic duals of a large class of 4d N = 2 SCFTs in geometric

engineering with regular punctures are known [12], until now the gravity duals of 4d field

theories from irregular punctures have remained mysterious.

The realization of Argyres-Douglas theories via M5-branes wrapped on spheres with irreg-

ular punctures offers the prospect of studying their properties in holography. In this paper we

present the first gravity duals of AD theories in M-theory, and provide a new perspective on

both the geometry of the irregular puncture and the curious field theoretic properties of these

SCFTs. An important motivation to this work has been the recent work on branes wrapping spindle geometries1 [14, 15] as a novel way of preserving supersymmetry beyond the paradigm

of the topological twist in supergravity [16]. Our construction will provide yet another way of

preserving supersymmetry, by wrapping branes on a disk with a nontrivial U (1) holonomy at

the boundary. Our setup can be thought of as M5-branes wrapping a "half-spindle".

A distinctive feature of our 11d solutions is the presence of localized M5-brane sources

in the internal space. These appear as singularities in the low-energy supergravity approx-

imation, but correspond to well-defined objects in the full M-theory. As demonstrated in

several examples [17­24], brane sources are useful ingredients in holography. In particular,

they provide an avenue to realizing arbitrary flavor symmetries. In our solutions the M5-brane

source is instrumental, and is in fact dual to the irregular puncture on the sphere. This novel

connection between irregular punctures and sources in supergravity paves the way to further

investigations and generalizations to other brane constructions.

Another peculiar property of our solutions is related to the interplay between the isometry

algebra of the internal space and the algebra of global zero-form symmetries in the SCFT.

In particular, we identify a U (1) isometry generator that is not mapped to a generator of

a continuous U (1) global zero-form symmetry of the dual field theory. Indeed, the would-

be massless U (1) gauge field associated to this isometry generator is actually massive in the AdS5 low-energy effective action, by virtue of a novel Stückelberg mechanism involving an axion field originating from the expansion of the M-theory 3-form. The interplay between the background G4-flux supporting the holographic solution and the isometry group of the internal space can be elegantly described in the language of equivariant cohomology. Our physical analysis in terms of a Stückelberg mechanism detects an obstruction to finding a closed equivariant completion of G4--and provides a recipe to overcome it.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present a new class of AdS5 solutions in 11d supergravity that preserve N = 2 superconformal symmetry. We first describe the solutions in 7d U (1)2 gauged supergravity, and then give their uplift on S4 to eleven dimensions. The solutions feature an M5-brane source, and their flux configuration is encoded by three positive integers. We compute the holographic central charge, as well as the charges of various supersymmetric probe M2-branes wrapping two-cycles in the internal space.
In section 3 we use the machinery of anomaly inflow to extract the global symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies of the SCFTs dual to the aforementioned supergravity solutions. We verify that the central charge thus computed is compatible with the holographic central charge, and additionally compute the flavor central charge. An important ingredient in the matching of the global symmetries is a Stückelberg mechanism, in which one U (1) generator of the isometry algebra of the internal space is spontaneously broken.
In section 4 we describe the proposed 4d N = 2 field theories dual to our supergravity solutions, and perform tests of the holographic duality. The field theories are of ArgyresDouglas type, and arise from N M5-branes wrapped on a sphere with one irregular puncture and one regular puncture. We test the duality by matching the N = 2 R-symmetry generators, the large-N central charge, the flavor central charge associated to the regular puncture, the rank of the flavor symmetry, and the field theory operators dual to M2-brane probes.
Finally, several appendices elaborate on derivations and ideas used in the main text. Appendix A provides a full derivation of the 7d gauged supergravity solutions. Appendix B casts the uplifted 11d solutions into canonical N = 2 form. Appendix C collects useful formulae on the 't Hooft anomalies of 4d N = 2 SCFTs. Appendices D and E serve as select reviews of the literature on Argyres-Douglas theories: appendix D gives an overview of the landscape of four-dimensional field theories of Argyres-Douglas type, while appendix E reviews the dual quiver Lagrangian description found in [25, 26] of a subclass of the AD theories dual to our supergravity solutions.
A brief summary of some results of the supergravity solutions and checks of the proposed duality were first reported in [27].
2 Supergravity Solutions
This section is devoted to a discussion of a new class of 11d supergravity AdS5 solutions. They are first obtained in 7d gauged supergravity and then uplifted to eleven dimensions.

2.1 Solutions in 7d Supergravity
The reduction of 11d supergravity on S4 yields the 7d N = 4 SO(5) gauged supergravity of [28]. In this work we consider a further truncation to the Cartan subgroup U (1)2 of SO(5). We follow the notation and conventions of [29]. The bosonic field content of the U (1)2 truncated model consists of the 7d metric gµ, two real scalars 1, 2, two U (1) gauge fields A(µ1), A(µ2), and a real 3-form potential Cµ. (The indices µ, , . . . are curved 7d spacetime indices.) The equations of motion and BPS equations for this supergravity model are recorded in appendix A.1. The mass scale of the model is denoted m. In our conventions, the AdS7 vacuum solution has radius LAdS7 = 2/m. The gauge coupling of the model is denoted g, and supersymmetry relates it to m as g = 2 m.
As derived in appendix A, the following bosonic field configurations preserve 4d N = 2 superconformal symmetry and solve all equations of motion. The 7d metric is given by

m2 ds27 =

2 B w3/5  (1 - w2)

ds2(AdS5) + ds2()

,

ds2() =

dw2 2 w h(w) [ (1 - w2)]3/2

+

C2 h(w) dz2 B

.

(2.1)

Here ds2(AdS5) is the unit-radius metric in AdS5, w is an interval coordinate whose range is discussed below, z is an angular coordinate, B is a positive constant, C is a real constant,   {1, -1} is a sign, and the function h(w) is given by

h(w) = B - 2 w  (1 - w2) .

(2.2)

The scalar fields 1, 2 depend on the coordinate w only and are given as

1

=

3 5

log w

,

2

=

2 -5

log w

.

The gauge field A(1) has field strength F (1) = dA(1) given by

(2.3)

F (1) = -2 m-1 C w dw  dz ,

(2.4)

while the other gauge field A(2) and the 3-form potential C are set to zero. We observe that the angular coordinate z enters the 7d metric and the field strength F (1) always in the combination C dz. Without loss of generality we can then assign periodicity 2 to the coordinate z.
The range of the coordinate w is constrained by requiring that 1, 2 be real and the 7d metric positive-definite. Depending on the parameters  and B there are various cases, listed in appendix A.5. The case of main interest for this paper is

Figure 1: A schematic depiction of the internal geometry for the choice of parameters and range of the w coordinate specified in (2.5). The z circle is fibered over the w interval to yield  with metric ds2() in (2.1).  has the topology of a disk with a Z orbifold singularity at the center. We also depict the qualitative behavior of the AdS5 warp function f (w) = 2 B w3/5/ 1 - w2.

In the vicinity of w = w1, the AdS5 warp factor is smooth, and the z circle shrinks. (The function h has a simple zero at w = w1.) By tuning the constant parameter C we can ensure that z shrinks smoothly. More generally, if we impose

|C| =  1

,

1 - B2

= 1, 2, 3, . . . ,

(2.6)

the shrinking of the z circle gives an orbifold point R2/Z . For more details, see appendix A.5.
Near w = 0 the AdS5 warp factor vanishes and the 7d metric becomes conformal to the direct product of AdS5 and a cylinder. This can be seen setting w = r2 and observing that

m2 ds27  2 B r6/5 ds2(AdS5) + 2 B-1 dr2 + C2 dz2 ,

r  0+ .

(2.7)

The locus r = 0 is a curvature singularity of the total 7d metric. Figure 1 gives a schematic
depiction of  and the AdS5 warp factor. The space , equipped with the metric ds2() as in (2.1), has the topology of a disk,
with the origin at w = w1 and the boundary at w = 0. Indeed, the z circle does not shrink at w = 0 in the metric ds2(). As observed above, we have a Z orbifold singularity at the origin of the disk . There exists a gauge choice such that A(1) is well-defined near w = w1,

A(1) = -m-1 C (w2 - w12) dz .

(2.8)

Notice that we have fixed the ambiguity in A(1) by a shift by a constant times dz by requiring that the prefactor of dz vanishes at w = w1. In this gauge, A(1) is globally defined on the disk

­5­

. In appendix A.4 we verify that the Killing spinor on  is also well-defined near w = w1, and is therefore globally defined on the disk .
A brief digression about the normalization of A(1) is necessary. To find the natural normalization, we observe that A(1) is identified with the ab = 12 component of the field strength F ab of the full SO(5) gauged supergravity model (the indices a, b = 1, . . . , 5 are
vector indices of SO(5)). In the conventions of this paper--see also [28, 29]--the expression for F ab is F ab = dAab + g Aac  Acb, where g = 2m is the gauge coupling constant of the supergravity theory. It is natural to rescale Aab to eliminate the factor g between the linear
and quadratic terms in the field strength: we set

Aab

=

1 2m

Aab

,

(2.9)

so that the field strength of Aab is Fab = dAab + Aac  Acb. The rescaling of Aab induces an

analogous rescaling of A(1),

A(1)

=

1 2m

A(1)

.

(2.10)

Since in the gauge (2.8) A(1) is globally defined on the disk , the flux of the field strength F(1) = dA(1) through  equals minus the holonomy of A(1) along the boundary at w = 0,

hol(A(1)) :=

w=0

A(1) 2

=-



F(1) 2

= 2 C w12

=

C (1 -

1 - B2) .

(2.11)

We assign positive orientation to dw  dz, with w increasing from 0 to w1. The parameters B, C in the 7d solution can be expressed in terms of the integer and
the holonomy hol(A(1)),

C = hol(A(1)) + 1 ,

1 - B2 = 1+

1 hol(A(1))

.

(2.12)

We have anticipated that C is positive, which will be verified when we perform the uplift to eleven dimensions in section 2.3. We think of and hol(A(1)) as the geometric and gaugetheoretic input data that specify the solution. At this stage hol(A(1)) is an arbitrary real quantity. We will see that, in the uplifted solutions, it is identified with the ratio of two integer
G4-flux quanta. Let us compute the Euler characteristic () of  from the line element ds2() in (2.1)
using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, following similar computations in [14, 15]. A potential
contribution originates from the boundary of . One verifies, however, that the boundary at w = 0 is a geodetic in the metric ds2(), and thus has vanishing geodetic curvature. As a result, the only contribution to () originates from integrating the Ricci scalar of ds2() against the volume form of the metric ds2(),

This is the expected result for a disk in R2/Z centered at the origin.2 Our 7d solutions can be compared to the spindle solutions of [14, 15, 30­32]. As in those
references, the 2d space  is not equipped with a constant curvature metric. The gauge field A(1) does not cancel the spin connection on , and the Killing spinor has a non-trivial profile in the w direction (its explicit expression is recorded in (A.68)). These features signal that supersymmetry is realized in a way that deviates from the standard topological twist paradigm. In contrast to [14, 15, 30­32], however, our internal space  has the topology of a disk, with a non-trivial holonomy of the gauge field A(1) along its boundary. This is qualitatively different from the spindle geometries. Our  may be intuitively thought of as a "half spindle" and leads to a new way of realizing supersymmetry.

2.2 Uplift to Eleven Dimensions
The uplift on S4 of solutions to the 7d U (1)2 gauged supergravity model considered above has been analyzed in [33]. To perform the uplift, we find it convenient to make use of the formulae in [34]. It is useful to keep in mind that the authors of [34] set implicitly m = 1; it is straightforward to restore factors of m in their expressions. The 11d metric is given as

ds211 = (Tab Y a Y b)1/3 ds27 + m-2 (Tab Y a Y b)-2/3 (T -1)ab DY a DY b .

(2.14)

The indices a, b = 1, . . . , 5 are SO(5) indices and are raised/lowered with . The quantities Y a are constrained coordinates on S4, satisfying Y a Ya = 1. The symmetric, unimodular matrix Tab is constructed with the scalar fields 1, 2 as

Tab = diag(e21 , e21 , e22 , e22 , e-41-42 ) .

(2.15)

The 1-form DY a is defined as

DY a = dY a + g Aab Yb ,

(2.16)

(recall that g = 2 m) where A[ab] is an SO(5) connection with legs on 7d spacetime. Its only

non-zero components are

A12 = A(1) ,

A34 = A(2) .

(2.19)

2 This can be verified by equipping the disk with the flat metric of R2/Z : in this case, the only non-zero contribution to the Euler characteristic comes from the geodetic curvature of the boundary of the disk.

We parametrize the constrained coordinates Y a as

Y 1 = 1 - µ2 cos  , Y 2 = 1 - µ2 sin  , Y 3,4,5 = µ y^1,2,3 ,

(2.20)

where the three real coordinates y^1,2,3 are subject to the constraint (y^1)2+(y^2)2+(y^3)2 = 1 and thus parametrize an S2  R3. The coordinate µ has range [0, 1] and the angular coordinate  has periodicity 2. Using the 7d line element (2.1), the 7d scalar fields (2.3), and the 7d gauge field (2.4), the uplift formula (2.14) yields

2.3 Internal Geometry and Flux Quantization

For the rest of this section we specialize to the choice of parameters and range for w given in (2.5). The other possibilities discussed in appendix A.5 may also be uplifted to eleven dimensions and discussed in a similar fashion.

3

The

1-form

D

is

computed

in

the

gauge

A(1)

=

-m-1 C (w2 -

1 2

),

which

differs

from

(2.8).

As

explained

iz

in appendix A.4, in the gauge (2.8) the 7d Killing spinor  depends on z via the phase factor e 2 . Using

the combined transformation of A(1) and  recorded in (A.23), one verifies that, in the new gauge A(1) =

-m-1 C (w2 -

1 2

),

the

spinor



is

independent

of

z.

A

different

choice

of

gauge

is

equivalent

to

a

redefinition

of , z of the form (, z)  ( + c z, z), where c is a constant. We also notice that the choice of gauge for A(1)

does not affect the coefficient of z in  in equation (2.51) below, which is the data that is mapped to the

field theory side in (4.31).

Figure 2: The internal space in the 11d solution is an S1 ×Sz1 ×S2 fibration over the rectangle in the (w, µ) plane delimited by the points P1, P2, P3, P4. We indicate the constant value of the function L in the line element (2.25) on the sides P2P3 and P3P4. The point P3 is the location of a monopole of charge for the Dz fibration in (2.25). The warp factor vanishes along the side P1P4. The geometry in this region is interpreted in terms of smeared M5-branes. We also include the segment Q1Q2 which is used in section 2.3.2 in the discussion of G4-flux quantization.

2.3.1 Geometry of the Internal Space The 6d internal space in the 11d line element (2.21) can be regarded as an S1×Sz1×S2 fibration over the 2d base space B2 parametrized by w and µ, which is the rectangle [0, w1] × [0, 1], see Figure 2. Let us describe in greater detail the features of the internal geometry near the following three regions of the boundary of the rectangle B2:
· Region I: a neighborhood of the side P1P2 (depicted in green).
· Region II: a neighborhood of the union of the sides P2P3 and P3P4 (depicted in blue).
· Region III: a neighborhood of the side P1P4 (depicted in red).

Geometry of Region I. As we approach a point along the {µ = 0} side of the rectangle B2, at generic w  (0, w1), the S2 shrinks smoothly, capping off the internal space. Both Killing vector fields z and  have a finite norm as we approach µ = 0.
Geometry of Region II: Regular Puncture. To describe the geometry of this region we make use of the angular coordinates , z, but we break up the 1-form D and complete

­9­

instead the dz square. The resulting line element takes the form

The function h is defined in (2.2), while H is defined in (2.22). The metric functions R2 , Rz2 and the function L inside Dz are given as

(2.26)

We are describing the internal space in terms of S2 and the 4d space spanned by w, µ, , z.

The latter is an Sz1 fibration over the 3d space spanned by w, µ, . This description is modeled after [12] and the local geometries that describe regular punctures for M5-branes wrapped on

a Riemann surface [35, 36]. The Dz fibration over w, µ,  is a convenient device to keep track

of the two different linear combinations of the Killing vectors , z whose norms go to zero

on the two sides {w = w1} and {µ = 1} of the rectangle B2. We observe that R2 is the radius squared of the  circle in the 3d base, and that it goes
to zero both along µ = 1 and w = w1. More precisely, one can verify that

µ=1- 2 , w = w1 - 2 ,

These relations demonstrate that, in the 3d base of the Dz fibration, the shrinking of the  circle is smooth. The 3d base space is thus locally R3 in the vicinity of the boundary of B2, with  playing the role of an azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates. The radius squared Rz2 of the z circle, on the other hand, is only zero at the corner (w, µ) = (w1, 1).
The function L(w, µ) is piecewise constant along the sides {w = w1} and {µ = 1} of the rectangle B2. More precisely, one finds

L(w, 1) = 0 ,

L(w1, µ) =

1  C 1 - B2

.

(2.28)

The jump in L at the corner (w, µ) = (w1, 1) signals the presence of a monopole source for the Dz fibration. The monopole charge must be an integer. We find it convenient to adopt

­ 10 ­

the same orientation conventions as in the discussion of the local puncture geometries of [36]. In particular, the function L is non-negative and decreasing as we move along the axis of the R3 fiber (spanned by w, µ, ), starting from the point where the S2 shrinks (point P2 in Figure 2) and moving upwards towards P3 and then past the monopole towards P4. These considerations imply that C is positive, so that

1 

=,

C 1 - B2

= 1, 2, 3, . . . .

(2.29)

The integral quantization of the monopole charge can also be confirmed by a local analysis of the metric near the corner (w, µ) = (w1, 1). More precisely, we trade w, µ for coordinates R > 0 and   [0, ] defined via

µ=1-

 If C 1 - B2 = 1, the line element in curly brackets in the second line is a round S3 presented

as a standard Hopf fibration. The Hopf fiber is parametrized by z with period 2, while the

Hopf base is spanned by   [0, ] and  with periodicity 2. More generally, we can allow the quantity C 1 - B2 to be 1/ for any positive integer , as indicated in (2.29). The quantity

in curly brackets is then the metric on S3/Z . When the latter is combined with the radial direction R, we obtain the metric on R4/Z . Thus, for > 1 the geometry in Region II has

an orbifold singularity at the location of the monopole, and is smooth elsewhere. We have

demonstrated that the relation (2.6) in the 7d gauged supergravity solution is reinterpreted

in the uplifted 11d solution as the quantization of a monopole charge.

Geometry of Region III: Smeared M5-branes. This region requires special care because the warp factor in front of the AdS5 metric goes to zero as w approaches 0. The 11d line element can be approximated at small w as

m2 ds211  w1/3 2 B µ2/3 ds2(AdS5) + 2 C2 B µ2/3 dz2

+ w-2/3

µ2/3

dw2 + w2 ds2(S2)

+

µ2/3 1 - µ2

dµ2

+

µ-4/3

(1

-

µ2) D2

.

(2.32)

This line element is interpreted as originating from smeared M5-brane sources. More precisely, the M5-branes are:

· extended along the AdS5 and z directions;

­ 11 ­

· localized at the origin of the R3 parametrized by S2 and w, ds2(R3) = dw2 + w2 ds2(S2); · smeared along the µ and  directions.

After smearing, the branes are effectively real codimension-3 objects. Notice that w is identified with the radial coordinate away from the smeared branes. The relevant harmonic function for a real codimension-3 problem is H  1/w. As appropriate for an M5-brane solution, we find a prefactor H-1/3 in front of the six directions along which the M5-branes extend, while we find a factor H2/3 in front of the five directions in which the branes are localized or smeared.
We can confirm the presence of an M5-brane source from the expression of G4 near w = 0,

G4

= - volS2

 dµ  D m3

+...

,

w0.

(2.33)

In particular, the integral of the RHS along the S2, µ,  directions is finite as w  0. This signals the presence of a source of the schematic form dG4  (w) dw  volS2  dµ  D. The total charge of the source is computed integrating (2.33) and is equal to the flux quantum N defined below in (2.37), which is identified with the number of M5-branes on the stack wrapping .

2.3.2 G4-Flux Quantization

In our conventions for the normalization of G4 in 11d supergravity, the quantity that has

integrally quantized fluxes is G4/(2 p)3, where p is the 11d Planck length. We find it

convenient to define

G4

=

-

G4 (2 p)3

,

(2.34)

with the sign chosen for future convenience. The integral of the quantity G4 over any 4-cycle

in the internal space must be an integer.

In the discussion of the non-trivial 4-cycles in the internal geometry it is convenient to

use the presentation (2.25) and to make contact with the analysis of [35, 36] (see also [12]).

To this end, let us express G4 in terms of d and Dz, using (2.24) and the definition of Dz in

(2.25). We find

G4 =

(2.35)

where the 0-forms Y and W are given as

W

=

1 m3

3 p

C (1 - 2w2) µ3 µ2 + w2 (1 - µ2)

.

(2.36)

The function Y (w, µ) is piecewise constant along the P2P3 and P3P4 segments: Y (w1, µ) = 0, Y (w, 1) = 1/(m3 3p). These properties of Y are in line with the general analysis of [35, 36].
A first non-trivial 4-cycle, which we denote C4, is obtained by considering the segment Q1Q2 (see Figure 2) and combining it with the S2 and with the circle that shrinks along

­ 12 ­

the P3P4 segment. As we have seen above, the latter is the d circle in the base of the Dz

fibration. Since along the segment P3P4 we have L = 0, Dz = dz and the shrinking circle is simply d. The 4-cycle C4 has the topology of S4 and we identify it with the S4 fiber on top

of a generic point on  spanned by w, z. Having defined C4, we can now compute

G4 =

(2.37)

We have assigned positive orientation to dµ  d. The positive integer N is identified with

the number of M5-branes on the stack wrapping .

A different 4-cycle, denoted B4, can be constructed as follows. Let us consider the segment P2P3 and let us combine it with S2 and the Dz fiber. We get a 4-cycle because the S2 shrinks

as we approach P2, while the radius of Dz goes to zero as we approach the monopole location

at P3. The flux through B4 is

(2.38)

We have used (2.37), (2.29) and we have chosen the orientation of B4 in such a way that B4 = C4

in the case = 1. For > 1 the 4-cycles B4 and C4 are inequivalent. Flux quantization through

B4 demonstrates that N must be a multiple of ,

N N.

(2.39)

Finally, let us consider the 4-cycle D4, which is the analog of the 4-cycle B4 based on the segment P3P4. More precisely, we combine this segment with the Dz fiber and the S2. We know that Dz shrinks at P3. The total radius of the S2 in the 11d metric goes to zero as we

approach P4, because of the vanishing of the warp factor. The flux through D4 is

We observe that the 4-cycle D4 leads to a novel integral flux K, which is positive because

0 < B < 1.

In summary, the topology and flux configuration of the solutions we are studying are

encoded in three positive integers: , N , and K. Moreover, divides N . The constant

parameters B, C can we written in terms of , N , K as

Using these identifications, we can revisit the expression (2.11) for the flux of F(1) on , which is also equal to the monodromy of A(1) at w = 0 (in the gauge (2.8) in which A(1) is globally defined on the disk ),

(2.44)

The function D satisfies the Toda equation

x21 D + x22 D + y2eD = 0 .

(2.45)

The coordinate  is an angular coordinate with period 2. The 1-form D is defined as

D = d + v ,

v

(2.46)

The 2-form volS2 is the volume form on a unit-radius round S2. The Killing vector  is dual to the U (1)r R-symmetry of the 4d N = 2 SCFT, while the isometries of S2 are mapped to the SU (2)R R-symmetry.
The 11d solutions presented in section 2.2 can be cast into the canonical LLM form (2.43). Let us summarize here the salient feature of this match, referring the reader to appendix B.1 for more details. It is useful to introduce polar coordinates r,  on the x1, x2 plane,

x1 = r cos  , x2 = r sin  .

(2.47)

Using the expressions of y, r, D in terms of w and µ and the properties of the function G(w), one can verify that the Toda equation for D is satisfied. Finally, we have checked explicitly that the expression (2.43) for G4 matches with (2.24).
The formulae presented above apply to any choice of the sign  and range of w. Let us end this section with some remarks that apply to the case of interest (2.5). Combining the relations (2.48) with (2.41), we can write

The U (1)r superconformal R-symmetry is given by a non-trivial mixing between the z isometry direction on  and the  isometry of the topological S4 fiber on top of a generic point on . The Killing vector  is naively associated to a U (1) flavor symmetry of the SCFT. As we will see in section 3, however, this expectation is incorrect.

2.4 Holographic Central Charge and Supersymmetric Wrapped M2-branes
This subsection is devoted to the analysis of two holographic observables. We consider the choice of parameters and range of w specified in (2.5). Firstly, we extract the holographic central charge from the (warped) volume of the internal space. Secondly, we study probe M2-branes wrapping calibrated 2-submanifolds in the internal space.

2.4.1 Holographic Central Charge

As already observed in (2.43), the 11d line element is conveniently parametrized as

ds211

=

e2 m2

ds2(AdS5) + ds2(M6)

,

(2.52)

where AdS5 has unit radius and  is the warp factor. With this notation, the holographic

central charge reads [38]

c=

9 p

e9 volM6 ,
M6

(2.53)

where volM6 is the volume form of the metric ds2(M6). For our solutions, we extract , ds2(M6) by comparing (2.21) and (2.52), and we compute

For the case of interest (2.5), wmin = 0 and wmax = w1, yielding a finite central charge

c

=

.

The RHS can be written in terms of N , K, and by making use of (2.5), (2.41),

(2.55)

c

=

N2 K2 12 (N + K

).

(2.56)

We get a well-defined, finite result even though the 11d solution has singularities.

2.4.2 Supersymmetric Wrapped M2-Brane Probes
A probe M2-brane wrapping a calibrated 2d submanifold in the internal space gives a BPS particle in the external AdS5 spacetime. Our solutions preserve 4d N = 2 superconformal symmetry, but we find it convenient to study the calibration conditions with reference to a 4d N = 1 subalgebra. More precisely, any solution of the form (2.43) admits a doublet I, I = 1, 2 of Killing spinors on M6, constructed out of Killing spinors on S2 and suitable spinors in the 4d space spanned by , y, x1, x2. We select a linear combination  = cI I of the two Killing spinors and study calibration with respect to . We refer the reader to appendix B.2 for a more thorough discussion of Killing spinors for solutions of the form (2.43), and their relation to the most general supersymmetric AdS5 solution of [39].
The calibration condition for an internal 2d submanifold C2 can be written as [38]

Y C2 = volM6 (C2) ,

(2.57)

where volM6(C2) is the volume form on C2 induced by the metric ds2(M6) and the 2-form Y is constructed as a spinor bilinear,

Y

=

1 4



mn



dym



dyn

.

(2.58)

In the previous expression the indices m, n are curved indices on M6, with local coordinates dym, and mn = [mn] with Euclidean gamma matrices m in six dimensions. To write Y we find it convenient to write the quantity ds2(S2) that enters (2.43) as

ds2(S2)

=

d 2 1 - 2

+

(1

-

 2) d2

,

(2.59)

where the coordinate  lies in the interval [-1, 1] and the angle  has period 2. The expression for Y in terms of the quantities that enter the canonical LLM form of the solution is

We refer the reader to appendix B.2.2 for the expression of Y in terms of the µ, w, z,  coordinates. The conformal dimension  of the operator associated to the BPS particle originating from a probe M2-brane on the calibrated subspace C2 is given by [38]

1 42m3

3 p

e3 volM6 (C2) ,
C2

(2.61)

where we are still adopting the parametrization (2.52) of the 11d metric. We identify two calibrated submanifolds that can support supersymmetric M2-brane
probes. Firstly, we consider the 2-cycle C2 in M6 defined by taking the S2 on top of the

­ 16 ­

point P3 in the (w, µ) plane, with coordinates w = w1, µ = 1. At this point both the  and z circles shrink. The calibration 2-form Y restricted on C2 is most easily evaluated by using the expression (B.66),

Y

C2

=

w13/2(1 - w12)3/4 2 B3/2

volS2

.

(2.62)

On the other hand, the metric on C2 induced from ds2(M6) is readily extracted from (2.21),

ds2(C2) = w1

1- 2B

w12

ds2(S2)

=

ds2(S2)

.

(2.63)

We see that the calibration condition (2.57) is satisfied. Let O1 denote the M2-brane operator associated to the calibrated 2-cycle C2. The dimension of O1 is computed with (2.61),

(O1)

=

NK N +K

.

(2.64)

Another calibrated submanifold B2 is realized by considering the segment P3P4 (see Figure 2) and the combination of S1 and Sz1 that does not shrink in the interior of P3P4. This combination corresponds to the fiber Dz in the presentation (2.25). This submanifold is not
a 2-cycle. It rather describes an open M2-brane that ends on the M5-brane source at w = 0. The M2-brane sits at a point on the S2. The calibration 2-form Y on B2 can be computed using (B.66) and is given by

Y

B2

(2.65)

Here  is the value of the  coordinate on the S2 at which the M2-brane is located. The induced metric on B2 is extracted from (2.25),

ds2(B2)

=

dw2 2 w h (1 - w2)3/2

+

C2 h B

Dz2

.

(2.66)

Comparing (2.65) and (2.66) we see that the calibration condition (2.57) is satisfied, provided that the M2-brane sits at north pole of S2,  = 1. (We are defining the orientation of the
volume form on B2 to be dw  Dz.) Since B2 describes an open M2-brane, it corresponds to a collection of operators, which we denote collectively as O2i . The label i runs over various possible boundary conditions for the M2-brane ending on the M5-brane source. All operators O2i have the same dimension, computed from (2.61) to be

(O2i ) = K .

(2.67)

The degeneracy of the operators O2i (i.e. the range of the label i) can be estimated as follows. On general grounds, the M2-brane ending on the M5-brane sources can have several
boundary components. Thus, for each M5-brane in the source stack, we can decide whether

­ 17 ­

the M2-brane ends on that M5-brane or not. Recalling that the number of M5-branes at the source is N , this gives a total of 2N possibilities. We have to subtract 1, however, because the
M2-brane must end on at least one of the M5-branes. In conclusion, this counting argument gives a degeneracy of 2N - 1 for the operators O2i .
The charges of the operators O1, O2i under the U (1)r × SU (2)R R-symmetry can be computed on the gravity side using the methods of [38]. The derivation is reported in appendix
B.2.3. The result reads

r(O1) = 2 (O1) , R(O1) = 0 , r(O2i ) = 0 , R(O2i ) = (O2i ) .

(2.68)

In the previous expressions R denotes the Cartan generator of SU (2)R, normalized as to have integer eigenvalues.

3 Symmetries and 't Hooft Anomalies

In this section we analyze the global symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies of the SCFTs dual to the 11d solutions of section 2, for the choice of parameters and range of w specified in (2.5). We observe that the solutions admit a u(1)2  su(2) isometry algebra, but the algebra of continuous (0-form) symmetries of the dual SCFTs is only u(1)su(2), which is identified with the R-symmetry algebra of 4d N = 2 superconformal symmetry. This apparent discrepancy is explained via a Stückelberg mechanism. Moreover, we also compute the 't Hooft anomalies for the R-symmetry and the flavor symmetry associated to the R4/Z orbifold singularity, and we extract the corresponding flavor central charge.
The symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies of a holographic SCFT with a smooth M-theory dual can be extracted systematically using the methods developed in [40], building on [41, 42]. Let M6 denote the internal space of the holographic solution, as in the parametrization (2.52) for the 11d line element. The analysis makes use of an auxiliary 12-manifold M12, realized as a fibration of M6 over closed 6-manifold M6,

M6  M12  M6 .

(3.1)

The space M6 is interpreted as external spacetime, Wick-rotated to Euclidean signature, and extended from four to six dimensions as appropriate for application of the standard descent formalism for the anomaly polynomial. The fibration (3.1) of M6 over M6 includes non-zero connections for the isometry algebra of M6. These connections are interpreted as background gauge fields for the global symmetries of the SCFT. We will see momentarily, however, that this general expectation requires some refinement for the setups of interest in this paper.
A central role in the analysis of the symmetries and anomalies of the SCFT is played by the 4-form E4, which enjoys the following properties:
· E4 is a globally defined 4-form on the total space M12.
· E4 is closed.

­ 18 ­

· E4 has integral periods on 4-cycles in M12.

· E4 restricted to the M6 fiber over a generic point in M6 reproduces the closed 4-form G4/(2 p)3 that describes the G4-flux configuration that supports the AdS5 solution.

We interpret E4 as the object that encodes the boundary conditions for the M-theory 3-form in the vicinity of the stack of M5-branes that supports the SCFT. In the next section, we describe in detail the construction of E4. Crucially, we will encounter a difficulty in constructing E4 while incorporating background connections for the full u(1)2  su(2) isometry algebra of M6. The resolution of this difficulty will yield a physical explanation of the absence of a continuous 0-form flavor symmetry in the dual SCFT corresponding to this isometry.
Once the 4-form E4 is constructed, the 6-form anomaly polynomial of the SCFT, at leading order in the large N limit, is computed as

(3.2)

where E4  E4  E4 is a 12-form on M12 and M6 denotes integration along the M6 fibers.

3.1 Construction of E4
In this section we construct the 4-form E4. We find it convenient to proceed in steps. Firstly, we discuss the inclusion in E4 of background connections for the u(1)2 isometry algebra of M6 associated to the Killing vectors z and . We encounter an obstruction in the construction of E4, which is resolved by demonstrating that only one linear combination of the u(1)2 isometry generators translates to a continuous symmetry of the SCFT, with the other combination being spontaneously broken by a Stückelberg mechanism.

3.1.1 Obstruction in the Construction of E4
Our starting point is the G4-flux background G4, conveniently rescaled to G4 as in (2.34) to have integral periods. We aim at constructing a local expression for the 4-form E4, including background connections for the u(1)2 isometry algebra of M6 associated to the Killing vectors z and . (We postpone the discussion of the su(2) isometry algebra of the S2.) It is actually more convenient to use the linear combinations ,  of z and  defined in (2.51). The expression of G4 in terms of d, d is extracted from (2.24) and (2.48) and takes the form

(3.4)

­ 19 ­

The 4-form E4 is globally defined on M12 and can be expanded as a polynomial in the field strengths of the external connections associated to the Killing vectors , . As a result, the naïve ansatz for E4 takes the form

E4 = Gg4 +

I =,

I ,J =,

(3.5)

The 2-forms F I = dAI are the field strenghts of external U (1) gauge fields AI associated to the Killing vectors , . The objects 2I are 2-forms on M6, while 0IJ = 0(IJ) are 0-forms on M6, to be determined. The superscript `g' stands for "gauged" and indicates the operation of taking a p-form on M6 and making the replacements

d  (d)g := d + A , d  (d)g := d + A .

(3.6)

This replacement is necessary to promote a globally defined p-form on the fiber M6 to a globally

defined p-form on the total space M12. Since 0-forms are unaffected by this prescription, we

omit the superscript `g' on 0IJ .

We must demand closure of E4. This translates into a set of conditions on the unspecified

forms 2I , 0IJ ,

2I G4 + d2I = 0 , 2(I 2J) + d0IJ = 0 .

(3.7)

The symbol ,  denotes the interior product of a p-form with the vector field , , respectively. The 4-form E4 must be globally defined on M12, which means that 2I must be globally defined on M6. As a result, the first condition in (3.7) can only be satisfied if the 3-forms 2G4 and 2G4 are exact 3-forms on M6.
The 3-forms 2G4 and 2G4 are readily computed using (3.3),

2G4

2 G4

(3.8)

Both these 3-forms are manifestly closed. They are also globally defined on M6, because G4

and the Killing vector fields ,  are globally defined on M6. The 3-form 2G4 is exact:

we can write

2G4 = d

-

N

0

volS2 4

,

(3.9)

and the 2-form inside the total derivative on the RHS is globally defined on M6, because the 0-form 0 goes to zero at the loci {µ = 0}, {w = 0} where the S2 shrinks. A similar manipulation for 2G4 fails, because the 0-form 0 does not go to zero at w = 0. We can confirm that the 3-form 2G4 is closed but not exact by computing its integral over the 3-cycle C3 defined as follow (see Figure 2). Consider a path in the (w, µ) plane connecting a generic point Q1 on the P1P2 segment to the point P4. Combining this path with the S2 we get a 3-cycle, because the S2 shrinks both at Q1 and P4. The integral of 2G4 over C3 is indeed non-zero, and evaluates to

2G4 = - N 0 P4 = N C = K + N .

C3

(3.10)

­ 20 ­

In the last step we used (2.41). Recall that N is divisible by , so C3 2G4 is an integer. The 3-form 2G4 is not exact because of the presence of the localized M5-brane source
at w = 0. Indeed, we observe that D|w=0 = -C d. The "Gaussian pillbox" that measures the charge of the M5-brane source is defined taking w = constant  0 and considering the directions µ, S2, D. We may regard the Gaussian pillbox as a D  d fibration over µ and the S2. The base of this fibration can be identified with the 3-cycle C3, in the limit in which the point Q1 is brought towards P1.
The non-exactness of 2G4 is an obstruction to the construction of E4 via the ansatz (3.5). To proceed, we must consider a more general ansatz.

3.1.2 Resolution of the Puzzle: a Novel Stückelberg Mechanism

The analysis of the previous subsection revealed the importance of the following closed but

not exact 3-form on M6,

3

(3.11)

which is defined is such a way that

2G4 - N C 3 = 0 ,

3 = 1 ,
C3

(3.12)

where C3 is the 3-cycle in M6 defined above (3.10). We extend the ansatz for E4 including not only the external U (1) gauge fields A, A, but also an external 0-form gauge field a0

(a real periodic scalar, i.e. an axion). We think of a0 as the light mode originating from

fluctuations of the M-theory 3-form C3 along the cohomology class defined by the closed but

not exact 3-form 3. Let f1 be the 1-form field strength of a0. We allow for a non-trivial

Bianchi identity for f1, of the form

df1 =

qI F I .

I =,

(3.13)

The constant parameters qI will be determined momentarily. The field strengths of the U (1) gauge fields A, A remain standard, F  = dA, F  = dA.

The improved ansatz for E4 reads

(3.14)

(Since 3 has no legs along , , the gauging prescription `g' on 3 could be dropped.) Closure of E4 gives the conditions

2I G4 + d2I + qI 3 = 0 , 2(I 2J) + d0IJ = 0 , d3 = 0 , 2I 3 = 0 . (3.15)

The last two conditions are satisfied, because the 3-form 3 is closed and invariant under the action of both U (1) isometries, £I 3 = 0, as can be seen explicitly from its definition (3.11). The first condition in (3.15) can now be solved by setting

as can be seen from (3.9), (3.12). Notice that we can set 2 to zero without loss in generality: a non-zero 2 could be reabsorbed by a redefinition of 3 by an exact piece. Since 2 has no legs along  and/or , we can solve the second condition in (3.15) simply setting 0IJ = 0.
Having identified the parameters qI , the Bianchi identity (3.13) for f1 reads

df1 = N C F  , f1 = da0 - N C A .

(3.17)

It demonstrates that the U (1) gauge field A gets massive via a Stückelberg mechanism by "eating" the axion a0. The U (1) gauge group associated to A is thus spontaneously broken.
There might be a non-trivial cyclic discrete subgroup that remains unbroken after the Stückelberg mechanism. In order to determine this discrete subgroup, it is necessary to fix the normalizations of the axion a0 and the vector A. The fact that the 3-form 3 integrates to 1 over C3, see (3.12), suggests that a0 is correctly normalized (i.e. is a compact scalar with period 2). Fixing the normalization of A is more subtle. It would also be interesting to identify which operators in the dual SCFT would be charged under the discrete subgroup left over after the Stückelberg mechanism. We leave these questions for future investigation.
We conclude this section with a comparison with the spontaneously broken U (1) symmetries in M-theory discussed in [43]. In that reference, the focus is on U (1) p-form symmetries originating from the expansion of the M-theory 3-form C3 onto cohomology classes. Some of these symmetries are spontaneously broken by topological mass terms of BF type. A BF coupling is related to a Stückelberg mechanism by dualization of a p-form gauge field (as reviewed for instance in [44]). Thus, the main physical mechanism observed in the present setup is the same as in [43]. Their 11d origin, however, is different: while in [43] all BF couplings originate from the C3G4G4 Chern-Simons term in the M-theory effective action, in the solutions of this paper the Stückleberg coupling originates from a non-trivial Bianchi identity, which is required by self-consistency of G4 after the Kaluza-Klein vector A is turned on.

General Formulation. We have uncovered an example of the following phenomenon in M-theory reductions to five dimensions:

A U (1) gauge field associated to an Abelian isometry of the internal space M6 gets massive by eating an axion originating from the expansion of the M-theory 3-form C3 onto a non-trivial class in the third cohomology of M6.

Let us give a general formulation of the conditions for this phenomenon to happen.
Let I be an index labeling the generators of the U (1) factors in the isometry group of M6. Let I be the Killing vector field associated to the I-th factor. We use the notation I , £I for the interior product with the vector field I and the Lie derivative along I , respectively. Let [3x] be a basis of the de Rham cohomology H3(M6, R), x = 1, . . . , b3(M6).
In order for the Killing vector field I to be a symmetry of the full holographic M-theory solution, we must demand £I G4 = 0. As a result, the 3-form 2I G4 is necessarily closed, as follows immediately from dG4 = 0 and £I = dI + I d. The closed 3-form 2I G4 defines a

­ 22 ­

(possibly trivial) de Rham cohomology class, which can be expanded onto the basis [3x] as

[2I G4] + QxI [3x] = 0 .

(3.18)

The expansion coefficients QxI are identified with the constants entering the Bianchi identities for the field strengths f1x of the axions ax0 obtained from expanding C3 onto the basis [3x],

df1x = QxI F I ,

f1x = dax0 + QxI AI .

(3.19)

Here F I = dAI is the field strength of the U (1) gauge field AI associated to the Killing vector field I . Non-zero coefficients QxI indicate a non-trivial Stückelberg mechanism. If the U (1) gauge fields AI and the axions ax0 are correctly normalized, the coefficients QxI are integrally quantized. They determine to which cyclic subgroup the U (1) gauge group associated to AI is spontaneously broken by the Stückelberg mechanism. To see this, we observe that
the Stückelberg couplings encoded in (3.19) can equivalently be cast in the form of BF-like topological terms [44, 45]. This can be done by dualizing the axions ax0 to 3-form potentials c3x. The relevant topological terms in the 5d supergravity effective action take the form

Stop

=

1 2

QxI

c3x  F I ,
M5

(3.20)

where M5 is 5d external spacetime. This topological action describes 5d 1-form and 3-form gauge fields with discrete gauge group. The discrete gauge group is read off from the Smith normal form of the matrix QxI [46].
We observed above that, in our solutions, non-exactness of 2G4 is closely related to the presence of an M5-brane source in the solution. It is natural to ask whether smooth solutions without internal sources can be found, for which 2I G4 is non-trivial in cohomology for some isometry direction I. We aim to address this question more systematically in the future.
As discussed in [40, 47], the construction of E4 from G4 can be phrased mathematically using the language of G-equivariant cohomology (where G stands for the isometry group of the internal space M6). More precisely, G4 is a closed invariant form on M6, and the task at hand is to construct an equivariant extension of G4. Obstructions to such a construction have been discussed in the mathematical literature [48]. Our physical analysis detects the obstructions and offers a way to circumvent them, by generalizing the notion of equivariant extension with the inclusion of the axion field.
In our discussion so far we have implicitly modeled p-form gauge fields using differential forms. While this is adequate to capture local aspects of their dynamics (such as their curvatures), a better mathematical framework to describe the physics of p-form gauge fields is differential cohomology (reviews aimed at physicists include [49­51]). Since we are turning on gauge fields associated to the isometries of M6, we should be actually employing G-equivariant differential cohomology [52]. It would be interesting to adopt this language to study the obstructions we have encountered and their resolution.

3.2 Anomaly Inflow

Having identified how to treat the isometry direction , we can complete the construction of the full form of E4, including background su(2) gauge fields associated to the non-Abelian isometry algebra of the S2. This is most easily accomplished noticing that G4, 2, and 3 all have a common factor volS2. We may simply perform the replacement

(3.21)

where e2 is the global angular form of SO(3), which is closed, gauge-invariant, and normalized to integrate to 1 on S2. (We refer the reader to (B.71) for the explicit expression of e2.) Notice that the non-Abelian isometry su(2) cannot participate in any non-trivial Stückelberg
mechanism with the axion a0. In conclusion, the final form of E4, including the external U (1) gauge fields A, A, the
axion a0, and the background su(2) gauge fields, can be written as

The central charges a, c are related to the 't Hooft anomaly coefficients for the SU (2)R ×U (1)r R-symmetry as reviewed in appendix C. Comparing (3.27) with (C.1) and using the relations (C.4), we verify that (3.27) is compatible with the holographic central charge (2.56).

3.2.1 Flavor Central Charge From Anomaly Inflow

Expanding the M-theory 3-form C3 onto the resolution cycles of the R4/Z orbifold singularity at P3, one obtains - 1 Abelian gauge fields. The gauge group enhances to SU ( ) by virtue of states from M2-branes wrapping the resolution cycles [12]. We can compute the associated flavor central charge kSU( ) by computing the mixed 't Hooft anomaly between SU ( ) and U (1)r. To this end, we can follow the methods of [36]. We turn on background gauge fields A,  = 1, . . . , - 1 for the Cartan subalgebra of SU ( ). We include a new term in E4,

We may repeat the computation of the fiber integral of E43 including the new term (3.28). We obtain an additional term in the inflow anomaly polynomial,

4 Field Theory Duals

We propose that the supergravity solutions presented above are dual to four-dimensional SCFTs that arise from the low-energy limit of N M5-branes--whose worldvolume theory at low energies is the 6d (2,0) theory of type AN-1--wrapped on a sphere with one irregular and one regular puncture. The 4d SCFTs of interest are of Argyres-Douglas type, meaning they are intrinsically strongly coupled and possess relevant Coulomb branch operators with fractional dimensions. In this section we review the properties of these field theories, and discuss the matching of their central charges and operators to the gravity duals. In appendix D we further elaborate on the landscape of Argyres-Douglas SCFTs, their properties, and their geometric construction via irregular punctures.
4.1 Properties of the (A(NN-)1[k], Y ) Argyres-Douglas SCFTs
The field theories dual to the supergravity solutions presented in section 2 are the 4d N = 2 SCFTs that are geometrically engineered by wrapping N M5-branes on a sphere with one irregular puncture of type A(NN-)1[k], and one regular puncture. The labeling of the irregular puncture follows from the classification in [9, 10]--we refer the reader to appendix D for a review.5 The regular puncture is labeled by a Young diagram in the shape of a rectangular box with columns and N/ rows, which we denote by Y . We refer to the 4d SCFTs thus constructed as (A(NN-)1[k], Y ). These SCFTs carry three integer labels: N the number of M5-branes, k > -N labeling the irregular puncture, and a positive integer that divides N labeling the regular puncture, which contributes an SU ( ) flavor symmetry. The case
= 1 corresponds to the "non-puncture", and is equivalent to having no regular puncture on the sphere. These are the (AN-1, Ak-1) SCFTs which can also be obtained in Type IIB string theory [55], and throughout this section we interchangeably refer to the = 1 cases as (A(NN-)1[k], Y1) and (AN-1, Ak-1). The case = N corresponds to the maximal puncture with associated SU (N ) flavor symmetry, known also as the Dpb==Nk+N (SU (N )) theories studied in [56­58].

4.1.1 R-symmetry Twist
We denote the R-symmetry of the N = 2 SCFT by SU (2)R × U (1)r, with R = 2I3 the Cartan generator of SU (2)R (in conventions in which R has integer-valued charges), and r the generator of U (1)r. The R-symmetry that is preserved at the fixed point can be deduced from the properties of the Higgs field  in the Hitchin system that arises from first compactifying the
5 These are also denoted as Type I theories in [9], and IN,k theories in [54].

­ 26 ­

6d (2, 0) theory on a circle to five dimensions, and then twisting over the sphere (see appendix

D for more details). The U (1)r symmetry of the 4d N = 2 field theory is a combination

of the SO(2)  SO(5) R-symmetry that would be preserved in the absence of an irregular defect on the sphere, and a global U (1)z isometry of the sphere.6 This combination can be

fixed by requiring that the coefficient to the leading singularity of the Higgs field (the matrix

Tk in (D.1)) is covariant under a U (1)r rotation. For an irregular puncture of type A(Nb)-1[k],

the result is to fix the SO(2) generator to be proportional to the U (1)z generator, with

4.1.2 Seiberg-Witten Curve and Deformations

The Seiberg-Witten curve of the 4d theory is identified with the spectral curve of the Hitchin system. The Seiberg-Witten curve in the conformal phase is

y2 = xN + zk ,

(AN-1, Ak-1) ,

(4.2)

from which it follows (by requiring that the dimension of the Seiberg-Witten differential SW = xdz is unity) that the scaling dimensions of x and z are

The possible deformations of the curve (4.2) take the form uabxazb, and are encoded in

a Newton polygon. For the (AN-1, Ak-1) ( = 1) theories the Newton polygon consists of a

where  is the leading pole for the irregular singularity from (D.1) (see [9]). An example

with coordinates (a, b) encodes a deformation uab of the curve, with dimension

y2  uabxazb ,

.

(4.4)

Points that lie on the lines zk-1 and xN-1 are excluded, since they can be removed by translation invariance of the z coordinate, and by removal of the U (N ) trace ( is traceless). The remaining points fall into the following classes:

· Parameters uab with dimensions (uab) > 1 correspond to Coulomb branch operators, which we will denote by ui with one subscript. These operators are by definition scalar primaries of the protected chiral N = 2 multiplets LB¯1[0, 0](r0;r) (in the notation of

6 Indeed, the requirement that U (1)z is globally defined is what leads to the restriction that the Riemann surface in the compactification must have genus zero.

bounding the triangle correspond to the N - 2 exactly marginal deformations.

[59]) with R-charges r(ui) = 2(ui) and R = 0. The total number of Coulomb branch operators is the rank of the Coulomb branch, which was computed for the (AN-1, Ak-1) theories from the Type IIB geometric engineering setup in [60] (based on proposals in [61]) and then corrected in [58]. The result is

· For every Coulomb branch operator whose dimension satisfies 1 < (ui) < 2, there is a corresponding coupling i with (i) < 1 that satisfies (ui) + (i) = 2 [2]. These couplings are identified with relevant (N = 2)-preserving deformations of the form d4 iUi, for Ui the chiral superfield whose bottom component is ui.

· Deformation parameters with (uab) = 1 correspond to mass deformations, whose number is equal to the rank of the global symmetry F of the SCFT. For the (AN-1, Ak-1) theories, this is [58]

rank(F ) = GCD(k, N ) - 1 ,

=1.

(4.7)

which for k an integer multiple of N reduces to rank(F ) = N - 1. These deformations
are paired with the moment map operators µ with dimension (µ) = 2 and R-charges (R, r)(µ) = (2, 0), which are the primaries of N = 2 multiplets B1B¯1[0, 0](22;0) containing conserved flavor currents.

­ 28 ­

· Exactly marginal couplings are identified with the parameters uab of dimension zero. The number of exactly marginal couplings is the complex dimension of the conformal manifold MC. For general k, N ,

dimCMC = GCD(k, N ) - 1 ,

(4.8)

as can be seen from the Newton polygon (also see [62]).
When k = mN for m a positive integer, there are N - 1 points on the bounding line of the Newton polygon in addition to the points at the tips of the triangle. N - 2 of these points correspond to exactly marginal deformations (since their dimension is zero), while one lies on the xN-1 line and is thus excluded. In this case the complex dimension of the conformal manifold MC is then N - 2,

dimCMC = N - 2 , k = mN .

(4.9)

When k = N , the dimension is reduced further to dimCMC = N - 3.

Adding an arbitrary regular puncture with Young diagram Y deforms the curve (4.2) of the (AN-1, Ak-1) theory with terms

(Here Y is arranged with column sizes decreasing from left to right and row lengths increasing from top to bottom.) For example, the maximal puncture = N consists of the diagram with N boxes in a single row, so hl = 1 for all l.

The v-parameters associated to the regular puncture appear as points in the lower right quadrant in the diagram of the Newton polygon, where the lowest point occurs at (a, b) = (0, -N (1 - 1 )).7
In Figure 4 we give the Young tableaux and Newton polygons of the possible box-diagram regular punctures for N = 4. The Newton polygons in Figure 4 are reflected versions of those in Figure 7 of [6], given in conventions such that they can be appended to the bottom of the Newton polygon of the = 1 theory (given for N = 4, k = 8 in Figure 3). For example,
7 Note that the addition of the regular puncture also allows the deformations corresponding to the zk-1 line in the Newton polygon to be turned on, since translational symmetry on the sphere is broken.

the Newton polygon of the = N theory is depicted in Figure 5 for N = 4 and k = 8.

To summarize, the Newton polygon for general > 0 consists of a right triangle in the first

quadrant whose hypotenuse has slope k/N , plus a reflected right triangle below the horizontal axis whose hypotenuse has slope (1 - 1 ).

Since all the vl,j in (4.11) have dimension greater than unity, they correspond to Coulomb branch operators ui. The dimensions of the Coulomb branch operators then satisfy

1 < (ui)  N -

N2 (k + N )

.

Given (4.18), our knowledge of the Coulomb branch operator spectrum from the Newton polygon, and (4.13), a and c can be computed for the = 1 theories as

the puncture is maximal, the central charges were first computed for k = mN in [54], and for general k, N in [57] (also see the nice summary in [62]). In this case,9

(4.22)

Now consider the case of an arbitrary regular puncture labeled by Y on the sphere. As described in [62], a straightforward way to compute the central charges is to start with the known central charges of the = N theories, and then to partially close the maximal puncture by giving a nilpotent VEV to the moment map operator of the SU (N ) flavor symmetry. The

(4.23)

In (4.23), aY , cY denote the standard contribution of the puncture Y ignoring the irregular puncture, which in this notation (following [62]) includes the contribution of one puncture to the bulk 't Hooft anomalies,   -1 for  the Euler characteristic (see appendix C). These quantities can be extracted from (C.8), and are given below in examples. IY is the embedding index of SU (2) into SU (N ) that labels the nilpotent VEV in the RG flow, defined in terms of the data of the Young diagram as

(4.24)

Here p~ is the number of rows in the Young tableaux, and k~i = ~i - ~i+1 for ~i the length of
the i'th row of the tableaux, in a convention where row lengths increase from top to bottom. Then, the Young tableaux is labeled by the partition N = i ik~i. See appendix C for more details.
As a first example of applying (4.23), consider the non-puncture = 1 given by the last diagram in Figure 4. In this case there are p~ = N rows each of length ~i=1,...,N = 1, such that the only nonzero k~i is k~N = 1. Then, the embedding index is

The contributions (aY , cY ) are given by

adding the contributions of (C.12), to the terms in (C.8) that are proportional to   -1.

For example, one computes aY as

(4.29)

Taking = 1 reproduces (4.19), while taking = N reproduces (4.21). The flavor symmetry central charge of the regular puncture is conjectured in [54] to
be equal to two times the scaling dimension of the Coulomb branch operator of maximal dimension. Using (4.12), for the regular puncture labeled by Y this translates into a flavor central charge kSU( ) of

kSU( ) = 2N -

2N 2 (k + N )

.

(4.30)

For example, kSU(N) reduces to (4.22) upon taking = N . In Table 1 we summarize the properties discussed in this subsection.

4.2 Checks of the Holographic Duality
Let us summarize the checks of our proposed holographic duality between the field theory data of the (A(NN-)1[k], Y ) SCFTs described in this section (and summarized in Table 1), and the supergravity solution described in sections 2 and 3.

tional part. The case = 1 yields a "non-puncture" on the sphere, and these reduce to the
class (AN-1, Ak-1). The case = N yields the maximal regular puncture with associated SU (N ) flavor symmetry. To compute the large-N scaling we assume that k is of order N .
The dimension of the conformal manifold is reduced according to (4.9) for special values of k.

· The flavor central charge kSU( ) for the SU ( ) symmetry associated to the regular puncture Y is given in (4.30) in the field theory. Translating from k to K using (4.31), we can rewrite

Using (4.31), we find that

this precisely matches the dimension and R-charges of the operator O1 computed in

(2.64), (2.68). We thus identify the wrapped M2-brane operator O1 with the maximal

dimension Coulomb branch operator.

· The rank of the flavor symmetry in the field theory is GCD(k, N ) + - 2. Of the total rank, - 1 corresponds to the SU ( ) flavor symmetry that is evident both in the field theory and gravity descriptions. The maximal remaining rank is N - 1, which matches the maximal possible rank from the source consisting of N M5-branes in the supergravity solutions (with the minus one corresponding to an overall center of mass mode). It will be interesting to further understand the dynamics of the source on the gravity side, and to explicitly see the reduction from rank N - 1 in the maximal case, to GCD(k, N ) - 1 depending on k. We also expect the matching of the dimension of the conformal manifold to depend on the detailed dynamics of the source.

A dual Lagrangian description of the (A(NN-)1[k], Y1) = (AN-1, Ak-1) Argyres-Douglas SCFTs for k an integer multiple of N was obtained in [25, 26].10 The RG flow of interest begins in the UV with a conformal N = 2 quiver gauge theory with N - 1 gauge nodes and non-abelian flavor symmetry group SU (k), to which we couple an N = 1 chiral multiplet that transforms in the adjoint representation of the SU (k) flavor group. One then undergoes the nilpotent Higgsing procedure that was first considered in [66, 67] (see also [68]). Upon giving a particular vev to this chiral multiplet and decoupling the massive and Nambu-Goldstone modes (utilizing [69]), one flows to the (AN-1, A(k=mN)-1) theory at low energies. This RG flow is reviewed in detail in appendix E, and both the UV and IR quivers are summarized in Figure 7. As we review in that appendix, many of the properties of the = 1 theories reviewed here are reproduced by the Lagrangian description.
Using the Lagrangian description, we have the following additional check for = 1 and k an integer multiple of N :

· One can construct 2N - 2 Higgs branch operators with R-charges (r, R) = (0, ), and

E).

Using

(4.31)

with

= 1 and

taking the limit that k, N   with k/N finite, these become

|N = K .

(4.34)

This precisely reproduces the dimensions and R-charges of the operators O2i computed in (2.67), (2.68). Recall from the discussion around (2.67) that in gravity, the degeneracy of the operators O2i is determined by the possible boundary conditions of the M2-brane on the M5-branes at w = 0, leading to a degeneracy of 2N - 1. We thus identify all but one of the operators O2i with the Higgs branch operators on the field theory side, while one mode decouples from the interacting fixed point. It would be interesting to understand the origin of this decoupled mode, which it is natural to expect is associated to the center-of-mass mode of the stack of M5-branes.
10The cases N = 2 with general k were first obtained in [64, 65] via RG flow from conformal SQCD.

5 Discussion
In this work we have proposed gravity duals for a class of 4d N = 2 SCFTs of Argyres-Douglas (AD) type, which can be engineered by wrapping a stack of M5-branes on a sphere with one irregular puncture and one regular puncture. The latter is described by a Young diagram of rectangular shape.11 Our solutions have been found in 7d gauged supergravity and uplifted on S4. Crucially, we find M5-brane sources in the internal space, which model the irregular puncture. We test the proposed holographic duality by matching the central charges and the dimensions of suitable BPS operators originating from wrapped M2-brane probes.
Our results suggest several natural directions for future investigations. It would be interesting to obtain a more systematic understanding of the structure of the novel solutions to the Toda equation of the type we have discovered. In particular, since the solutions are axially symmetric, one can analyze the electrostatic system obtained after the Bäcklund transform [12]. The goal is to identify the gravity duals of 4d N = 2 SCFTs of AD type featuring a regular puncture with a Young diagram of arbitrary shape, and to explore whether the field-theoretic classification of irregular punctures can be recovered from the gravity side.
The Stückelberg coupling involving the U (1) gauge field associated to the Killing vector  deserves further study. In particular, it would be interesting to identify the leftover discrete subgroup (if any) and the states in the dual SCFTs that are charged under it. More broadly, one can ask whether this phenomenon appears in other contexts in supergravity and how it is related to the presence of internal sources. The inclusion of external background gauge fields in the 4-form flux of M-theory can be described using equivariant cohomology. It would be beneficial to phrase the Stückelberg mechanism at hand in this broader mathematical language.
The anomaly inflow methods of [40] can be used to extract 't Hooft anomalies beyond the leading terms in the large-N limit. Moreover, O(N 0) terms could also be accessible via a study of singleton modes in the gravity dual. It would be interesting to apply these ideas to the solutions discussed in this paper, aiming to match the known exact 't Hooft anomalies of SCFTs of AD type.
It is also natural to study generalizations of our AdS5 solutions preserving 4d N = 1 superconformal symmetry. A class of N = 1 solutions describing M5-branes wrapped on a spindle have been presented in [32]. We would like to analyze whether N = 1 solutions with internal M5-brane sources can be found. More generally, a systematic analysis of N = 1 gravity solutions can yield useful insights into the spectrum of allowed regular12 and irregular punctures for 4d N = 1 SCFTs in class S and generalizations thereof [71­77].
A subset of the N = 2 SCFTs discussed in this paper can be realized as low-energy fixed points of Lagrangian N = 1 flows [25, 26]. It would be interesting to investigate Lagrangian realizations of the larger class of theories of AD type studied in this work. Furthermore, our
11Rectangular Young diagrams from orbifold singularities were studied in [70]. 12Holographic duals of N = 1 regular punctures were studied in [13, 23, 71].
­ 37 ­

AdS5 solutions offer a new avenue to study the holographic duals of these supersymmetryenhancing flows.

A Gauged Supergravity Solutions

In this appendix we provide a derivation of the 7d gauged supergravity solutions described in the main text in section 2.1. The supergravity model of interest is obtained as a U (1)2 truncation of the full 7d N = 4 SO(5) gauged supergravity of [28]. We follow the notation and conventions of [29].

The constant g is the gauge coupling of the 7d gauged supergravity model, related to m
as g = 2 m. The supersymmetry parameter is a 7d Dirac spinor, but we do not indicate
explicitly its spacetime spinor index. It also carries a index I = 1, . . . , 4 associated to the 4 representation of SO(5)c = U Sp(4)c, which is the composite SO(5)c symmetry of the scalar coset of the full 7d N = 4 SO(5) gauged supergravity [28]. The index I on I is acted upon by SO(5)c gamma matrices 1, . . . , 5; we have introduced 12 = 1 2 and 34 = 3 4. The 7d spacetime gamma matrices µ commute with the SO(5)c gamma matrices 1, . . . , 5.

A.2 Ansatz The ansatz for the 7d line element reads

ds27 = f (w) ds2(AdS5) + g1(w) dw2 + g2(w) dz2 ,

(A.11)

where ds2(AdS5) denotes the unit-radius metric on AdS5, w parametrizes an interval, and z is an angular coordinate, whose periodicity will be fixed later. The gauge field A(1) takes the

form

A(1) = Az(w) dz ,

(A.12)

while A(2) and the 3-form C are set to zero. The scalar fields 1, 2 are given in terms of a

single function of w,

1 = (w) ,

2

=

2 -3

(w)

.

(A.13)

These choices guarantee that the equations of motion for the 3-form, one of the scalars, and

one of the vectors are automatically satisfied, see (A.6), (A.2), (A.5).

The metric (A.11) suggests an obvious vielbein, with the flat directions 0, . . . , 4 associated

to AdS5, and the flat directions 5, 6 associated to w, z, respectively. The 7d gamma matrices

­ 39 ­

are decomposed according to

 =   3 ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 , 5 = I4  1 , 6 = I4  2 ,

(A.14)

where  are (flat) 5d spacetime indices,  are 5d 4 × 4 gamma matrices satisfying {, } = 2  with signature (-, +, +, +, +), and 1,2,3 are the standard Pauli matrices. The 7d supersymmetry parameter is written in the form

I = nI    .

(A.15)

The quantity  is a 4-component Killing spinor on AdS5, satisfying

A dS5



=

1 2

s  

,

(A.16)

where s  {±1} is an arbitrary sign. The quantity  is a 2-component spinor depending on the coordinates w and z. The quantities nI are the components of a constant object in the 4 representation of SO(5)c. They are subject to the projection condition

(12)I J nJ = i nI .

(A.17)

(Flipping the sign of the gauge field A(1) we could have equivalently written -i on the RHS.) Notice that we do not impose any additional projection condition on nI with 34. In other words, two out of the four components nI are retained by the projection. This ensures that, if a 2-component spinor  can be found that satisfies the BPS conditions spelled out below, the system automatically preserves 4d N = 2 superconformal symmetry.
The AdS5, w, and z components of the BPS equation (A.8) give respectively

(A.25)

(A.28)

The three algebraic equations above are of the form M (i)  = 0, where M (i), i = 1, 2, 3, are three 2 × 2 matrices, which can be parametrized as

M (i) = X0(i) I2 + X1(i) 1 + X2(i) (i 2) + X3(i) 3 . For each matrix M (i), let us define the column 2-vectors

(A.29)

v(i) =

X1(i) + X2(i) -X0(i) - X3(i)

,

and the quantities

w(i) =

X0(i) - X3(i) -X1(i) + X2(i)

,

(A.30)

Aij = det(v(i)|w(j)) ,

Bij = det(v(i)|v(j)) ,

Cij = det(w(i)|w(j)) ,

(A.31)

where (a|b) denotes the 2 × 2 matrix obtained by juxtaposition of the column 2-vectors a and

b. We seek a non-trivial solution to the algebraic BPS equations in which  is not identically

zero. Let us therefore pick a fixed but generic value of y for which  =

0 0

.

At

such

a

value

of

­ 41 ­

y, the quantities Aij, Bij, Cij are zero. This can be seen for instance as follows (we keep the

dependence on the chosen point y implicit throughout the argument). Since  =

0 0

,

we

can

choose a basis of C2 consisting of  and some other linearly independent 2-component spinor

. Let G be the GL(2, C) matrix that implements the change of basis from the standard basis

in C2 to the new basis {, }. Since  is annihilated by M (i), the first column of the matrix

M (i) in the new basis in zero, which means that we can write

M (i) = G-1

0 u(i) 0 v(i)

G,

(A.32)

where u(i), v(i) are unspecified. After parametrizing G =

ab cd

, we can extract the quantities

X1(i,2),3,4 in terms of u(i), v(i), a, b, c, d, and verify explicitly that Aij, Bij, and Cij vanish.

The vanishing of Aij, Bij, and Cij at a generic point in y where  =

0 0

gives us a number

of necessary conditions for the existence of a non-trivial solution, which facilitate the analysis.

The vanishing of the diagonal components Aii gives the conditions

The relation (A.40) is an algebraic relation for f in terms of . In particular, it implies that  is a constant if and only if f is a constant. The case of interest for this paper is  non-constant; the case of constant  does not yield new solutions. Let us therefore assume that  is not a constant. We can solve (A.40) for f ,

f = 2 B m-2 e ,

(A.56)

We have exploited the necessary conditions originating from the vanishing of the quantities Aij, Bij, Cij. We can now verify directly that a 2-component spinor  can be found, which satisfies the original algebraic BPS equations (A.26)-(A.28). This spinor is

The LHS must be positive to ensure positivity of g1. On the RHS, one of the two factors is a sum of positive quantities, hence is automatically positive, and therefore the other factor must

be positive, too. Finally, we consider the BPS equation (A.19) to determine Q as a function

of w. We get a simple ODE, which is solved by

To finish, we verify that all bosonic equations of motion are satisfied. Notice that we have not determined  as a function of w. This is in accordance with the
general covariance of the BPS equations and equations of motion. We find it convenient to fix the ambiguity in reparametrizations of w by choosing

(w) =

3 5

log w

.

(A.60)

­ 44 ­

This choice requires w > 0. The line element takes the form

A.4 Regularity of the Gauge Field and Killing Spinor
Let us study the regularity of A(1) and  for the choice of parameters (2.5), repeated here for convenience,

=1,

0<B<1,

0 < w < w1 :=

1 2

1-

1 - B2 .

(A.65)

From (2.1) we see that line element near w = w1 can be written as

r2 := w1 - w ,

m2 ds27 r =0

2 B w13/5 1 - w12

2 dr2 + C2 (1 - B2) r2 dz2 ds2(AdS5) + -h (w1) w1 (1 - w12)3/2

, (A.66)

which confirms that the w, z directions near the point w = w1 are locally an R2/Z orbifold if we impose (2.6). Since the z circle shrinks at w = w1, the quantity Az must vanish at w = w1. This requirement fixes the constant n,

n

C

B2

A(1) = -m-1 C (w2 - w12) dz .

(A.67)

We have made use of (2.6) and we have fixed sign(C) = +1, which is the choice made in the main text when discussing the uplift of the 7d solution. From (A.56) we see that we must select s = 1. The Killing spinor  is therefore given by

(A.69)

Let us now argue that  is well-defined near w = w1, using arguments similar to those

presented in [15]. We see from (A.66) that a good set of polar coordinates near the point

w

=

w1

is

furnished

by

the

angle

z

and

r

=

 w1 - w.

The

flat

metric

on

the

orbifold

R2/Z

can be written in various equivalent forms,

ds2

= dr2 +

1
2

r2 dz2

= dx2 + dy2

= (e1)2 + (e1)2

= (e 1)2 + (e 1)2

,

(A.70)

where the Cartesian coordinates x, y and the 1-forms e1,2, e 1,2 are defined as

x = r cos z , y = r sin z e1 = dx , e2 = dy , e 1 = dr , e 2 = 1 r dz . (A.71)

The vielbeins ea=1,2 and e a=1,2 are related by a local rotation,

e a = ab eb ,

ab = (exp )ab ,

ab =

0 -z/ z/ 0

.

(A.72)

Let  be a 2-component Dirac spinor in the frame ea, and let  denote its components in the frame e a. The transformation relating  to  is

 =S ,

S = exp

1 4

ab

ab

=

e-

iz 2

0

0

e iz 2

,

(A.73)

where we have chosen the 2d Euclidean gamma matrices to be 1 = 1, 2 = 2, with

1,2 standard Pauli matrices. The transformation (A.73) shows that, if the spinor  in the

Cartesian frame is constant, its components  in the polar frame acquire a z-dependence

through

the

phase

factors

e

iz 2

.

In particular, if  has negative chirality (its only non-zero

component is the lower

one),

it

acquires a phase

factor

e iz 2

.

This

is exactly

the

dependence

found in (A.69), demonstrating that our Killing spinor is well-defined near w = w1, because

it corresponds to a constant spinor in the Cartesian frame.

A.5 Alternative Possibilities for the Range of w
The allowed possibilities for the range of w depend on the values of the constant parameters  and B. We find six possibilities:

· Case I:  = 1, 0 < B < 1, 0 < w < w1 where





w1 =

1 2

1-

1 - B2

=

1 2

1+B- 1-B .

(A.74)

­ 46 ­

· Case II:  = 1, 0 < B < 1, w2 < w < 1 where





w2 =

1 2

1+

1 - B2

=

1 2

1+B+ 1-B .

 · Case III:  = 1, B = 1, 0 < w < 1/ 2.
 · Case IV:  = 1, B = 1, 1/ 2 < w < 1.

· Case V:  = 1, B > 1, 0 < w < 1.

· Case VI:  = -1, B > 0, 1 < w < w3 where

(A.75)

w3 =

1 2

1+

1 + B2 .

(A.76)

Case I has been discussed in the main text and in the previous subsection. Let us describe here the salient features of the line element in the other cases.

Case II. The z circle shrinks near the endpoint w = w2. If we impose the same condition as (2.6) above, we get an orbifold point R2/Z . As we approach w = 1, the AdS5 warp factor goes to infinity, see Figure 6. If we set w = 1 - B2 C2 r4/8 and consider the limit r  0+, the
line element takes the form

m2

ds27



4 r2

1 C2

ds2(AdS5)

+

dr2

+

dz2

,

r  0+ ,

(A.77)

from which we see that the 7d metric is given approximately by a conformal rescaling of the direct product of AdS5 and a cylinder. The space  in the metric ds2() in (2.1) has the topology of a disk, as in Case I. The regularity of A(1) and of the Killing spinor can be analyzed
in a similar way as done above in Case I.

Case III. This case is similar to Case I, except that the function h(w) has a double zero at w = 1/ 2. As a result the z circle does not shrink smoothly for any value of the constant C.

Instead,

if

we

set

w

as

,

R  + .

(A.78)

The behavior near w = 0 is similar to Case I.

 Case IV. The behavior as we approach w = 1/ 2 from the right is similar to the behavior of Case III approaching w = 1/ 2 from the left. The behavior in the limit w  1- is as in

Case II, with a decompactification of the z circle.

Case V. This case combines the features of Case I near w = 0 and the features of Case II near w = 1.

B Solutions in Canonical N = 2 Form
In this appendix we describe in greater detail the change of variables that brings the uplifted solution (2.21), (2.24) into canonical N = 2 LLM form (2.43). We also review some general facts about Killing spinors and spinor bilinears for LLM setups and their connections with the most general supersymmetric AdS5 solution of 11d supergravity discussed in [39].
B.1 Change of Variables to LLM Form
All solutions discussed in this paper fall into a subclass of the canonical LLM form (2.43) with an enhanced U (1) isometry. In terms of the polar coordinates (r, ) in the (x1, x2) plane introduced in (2.47), the function D depends on y and r only, and therefore the same holds

­ 48 ­

true for the warp factor , determined by D via (2.44). It follows that  is a Killing vector. When the function D is independent of , the Toda equation (2.45) and the expression (2.46) for the 1-form v take a simpler form,

(B.2)

The matrix that implements this linear change of coordinates has determinant 1, consistent

with the fact that all these four angular variables have period 2. As anticipated in the main

text, the LLM coordinates y, r are related to the coordinates µ, w in (2.21) via

16 B C2 1 - µ2 1+1/C B - 2 w  (1 - w2)

eD =

 (1 - w2) G(w)2

.

(B.7)

Using the chain rule, (B.7), (B.3), (B.4) one computes the derivatives of D with respect to y and r. The expressions for yD, rD, and the warp factor, computed from (2.44), are

-yD =

(B.8)

­ 49 ­

The second derivatives of D are computed in a similar way and can be used to verify that D satisfies the Toda equation in the form (B.1).
In order to verify that the G4 flux (2.24) matches with the LLM expression, it is convenient to observe that the LLM G4 flux is G4 = 1/(4m2) volS2  2, where

The 1-form (r rD dy -yeD r dr) is closed by virtue of the Toda equation, hence locally exact. For the solutions we are discussing, one verifies indeed that

r rD dy - yeD r dr = dF ,

F := -8 B w µ (C + 1) + 8 C µ .  (1 - w2)

(B.11)

In the second step we have used the definition (2.46) of D, the definition (2.23) of D, and the change of variables (B.2). The expression (B.11) for 2 shows that the G4 flux in (2.43) matches exactly with (2.24).

B.2 Killing Spinors and Calibration
In this section we review some facts about Killing spinors for the general LLM solution (2.43). In particular, we are interested in establishing a precise map with the Killing spinors and bilinears of the most general supersymmetric AdS5 solution of 11d supergravity analyzed in Gauntlett-Martelli-Sparks-Waldram (GMSW) [39]. Our aim is to study calibration conditions for wrapped M2-branes in the solutions described in this work.

B.2.1 Killing Spinors and Spinor Bilinears in LLM
Killing spinors and their bilinears for LLM solutions are described in detail in the appendices of the original paper [37]. The spinor bilinear analysis of [37] is performed for stationary 11d solutions containing an S5 and an S2 factor. They are related to the AdS5 solutions (2.43) by a double analytic continuation of S5 to AdS5 and time to the angle . Instead of following the analytic continuation, we find it convenient to repeat the steps of [37] directly for the AdS5 case. Our main objective is to set a consistent set of conventions and notation, so we will be brief and refer to the original paper for further explanations of some aspects of the Killing spinor analysis.

­ 50 ­

Split of M6 Into S2 and M4. The parametrization of the 11d line element and G4 flux is

ds211 = m-2 e2 ds2(AdS5) + ds2(M6) ,

G4 = m-3 G4 ,

(B.12)

where ds2(AdS5) has unit radius and  is the warp factor. This is the same parametrization as in [39], except that we have factored out the overall scale m-2. The quantity G4 is a closed form on M6. As in [39] the Killing spinor of 11d supergravity is decomposed as AdS  e/2 , where AdS is a Killing spinor on AdS5 and  is a Dirac (non-chiral) spinor on M6. The BPS equations for  are derived in [39]. We write them with m = 1 because we have factored out
the overall scale. They read

(B.13)

The indices m, n = 1, . . . , 6 are curved indices on M6, which are raised/lowered with the metric ds2(M6) defined by (B.12). Throughout this appendix, flat indices are underlined to distinguish them from curved indices. Thus the 6d gamma matrices with flat indices are denoted m. They are Hermitian and obey the Clifford algebra {m, n} = 2 mn. The chirality matrix 7 is defined as 7 = 1 . . . 6, is anti-Hermitian, and satisfies 72 = -1. As usual, a gamma matrix with several indices denotes the product of gamma matrices totally
antisymmetrized with weight 1.
To specialize the general BPS equations (B.13) to LLM setups, we write the internal metric ds2(M6) in the form

ds2(M6) = e2A ds2(S2) + ds2(M4) ,

(B.14)

where ds2(S2) is the metric on a unit-radius round sphere, ds2(M4) is a Riemannian metric on a 4d space M4, and A is a function on M4. The G4 flux is parametrized as

G4 = F  volS2 ,

(B.15)

where volS2 is the volume form of the metric ds2(S2) and F is a closed 2-form on M4. The 6d index m is split as m = (x, ), with x = 1, 2 for the S2 directions and  = 1, 2, 3, 4 for the
M4 directions. Following [37], we split the 6d gamma matrices m as

x = x  5 ,  = 1   ,

(B.16)

where x=1,2 are the standard Pauli matrices and the 4d gamma matrices  are Hermitian and satisfy {, } = 2 . The 4d chirality matrix 5 is defined as 5 = 1 . . . 4, is Hermitian, and satisfies 25 = 1.
We decompose the 6d Dirac spinor  that enters the BPS conditions (B.13) into Killing spinors on S2 and Dirac spinors on M4. More precisely, we write

I = I  + + (i 3 I )  - .

(B.17)

­ 51 ­

In the above relation, ± are Dirac spinors on M4 while I is a basis of independent Killing 2-component spinors on S2, satisfying

Sx2 I

=

+

i 2

x I

.

(B.18)

The index I = 1, 2 is not a spinor index, but rather labels the two linearly independent solutions to the above equation. We can regard I as a fundamental index of the isometry algebra su(2) = so(3) of the round S2. The fact that the 6d spinor  carries a label I = 1, 2 is simply the statement that we are seeking solutions preserving 4d N = 2 superconformal symmetry. Notice that the spinor (i 3 I) satisfies the Killing equation (B.18) with +i on the RHS replaced with -i.
The spinors ± are not independent, but rather related as (see [37] and also [78])

- = -a 5 + , a = ±1 .

(B.19)

As a result, we can also write the expression (B.17) for  as

I = (1 - a 7) (I  ) ,

Dirac Bilinears. We are now in a position to retrace the steps of [37] to study bilinears constructed with and projection conditions on . Dirac bilinears are constructed with ¯  . The scalar bilinear is a constant: we choose the normalization

¯ =1.

(B.22)

The pseudo-scalar bilinear defines a non-trivial 0-form on M4. The Fierz rearrangements

(¯ )2 = -(¯ 5 )2 = (¯ )2 - (¯5 )2 ,

(B.23)

together with the fact that ¯ is real and ¯ 5 purely imaginary, show that |¯5 |  |¯ | = 1. Therefore, we can parametrize ¯5 as

¯5 = - sin  ,

(B.24)

with   [-/2, /2]. The quantity  is related to the canonical coordinate y in LLM form

(2.43) via

y = e3 sin  .

(B.25)

­ 52 ­

The vector bilinear defines a Killing vector, which is identified with the canonical angular direction  in the standard LLM form (2.43). More precisely, if y are local coordinates on

M4, we can write

¯ 

 y

=

 

.

(B.26)

The pseudo-vector bilinear ¯ 5 turns out to be given in terms of the warp factor and the derivative of the pseudo-scalar bilinear ¯5 . More precisely, we can write

¯ 5

dy

=

ia -2

e-3

dy

.

(B.27)

The Fierz rearrangements (B.23), together with the additional Fierz identity

(¯ )(¯5 ) = 0 ,

(B.28)

can also be used to constrain the form of the metric on M4. Together with the coordinates , y defined in (B.26), (B.25), we have two coordinates xi, i = 1, 2. The line element reads

ds2(M4)

=

(d

(dy2

.

(B.29)

Notice how (B.28) is exploited by choosing the coordinate y not to have any mixed metric
component with any other coordinate. The quantities , vi, ij and the warp factor depend on y, xi, but not on . A natural vielbein for ds2(M4) is

e = cos  D  cos  (d + vi dxi) ,

ey =

,

2 e3 cos 

ei =

ei , (B.30)

2 e3 cos 

where e1, e2 is a vielbein for ij. We choose the orientation i = 1, i = 2, , y, so that 12y = 1 and 5 = 1 2  y.
Following the steps detailed in appendix F.2 of [37], one can manipulate the BPS conditions (B.21) on to determine the function A and the 2-form F . The function A is

eA

=

a -2

sin 

.

(B.31)

The coordinate y in LLM form is non-negative. Comparing (B.25) and (B.31) we see that we

have to choose the sign a to be

a = -1 .

(B.32)

The sign of a is correlated to our choice (B.24). We could perform the redefinition   - and change the sign of a. The 2-form F is given by

where 3 denotes the Hodge star operation associated to the line element dy2 + ij dxi dxj, with ordering i = 1, i = 2, y.

­ 53 ­

Projection Conditions. We may now plug the values of A and F in the first and third BPS equation in (B.21). The resulting algebraic conditions on the spinor can be manipulated to take the form of projection conditions. More precisely, one finds

1 - i 12 = 0 ,

cos  + i sin  y + i y 5 = 0 .

(B.34)

These relations take a simpler form in terms of the rescaled spinor

=

e

i 2



y

,

(B.35)

since they can be written as

1 - i 12 = 0 ,

1 + i y 5 = 0 .

(B.36)

These relations demonstrate that has only one independent component. Moreover we can always use a local Lorentz rotation to make sure that is independent of the coordinates y, x1, x2. (Its  dependence will be fixed momentarily.)
Majorana Bilinears. To proceed we follow [37] and construct a Majorana 1-form bilinear. The 4d charge conjugation matrix C satisfies

()T = -C  C-1 , CT = -C .

(B.37)

The bilinear of interest is

1 = T C  dy .

(B.38)

Since the matrices C, C 5, and C  5 are antisymmetric, and the spinor is Grassmann even, the bilinears T C , T C 5 , and T C  5 are all identically zero. This information, combined with the projection conditions (B.34), allow one to conclude that the 1-form 1 has only one independent component, because

T C y = 0 ,

T C  = 0 ,

T C 2 = -i T C 1 .

(B.39)

The definition (B.35) implies

T C 1 = cos  T C 1 .

(B.40)

Using this relation, the 1-form 1 can be cast in the form

1

=

1 2

e-3 (

T

C

1

)

e1 - i e2

,

(B.41)

where e1, e2 is a vielbein for the ij metric in (B.29). The 2-form d1 can be computed making use of the BPS equations (B.21), with the result

d1

=

i 4

(

T

) dy  dy - 3 d  1 .

(B.42)

­ 54 ­

The components of the bilinear T C  are greatly constrained by the projection conditions (B.34). Combining them with the fact that T C  5 is identically zero, one verifies

i T C y2 = T C y1 = i tan  T C 1 ,

i T C 2

= T C y1

=

-

1 cos



T C 1

,

T C 12 = 0 = T C y .

(B.43)

These relations allow one to recast the equation for d1 in the form

d1 = -

y e-6

dy - i D - 3 d  1 .

2 (1 - y2 e-6)

(B.44)

As explained in [37], using (B.41) and the fact that the rescaled spinor is independent of y, x1, x2, one can use (B.44) to argue that the vielbein for the metric ij can be chosen to be

e1 = eD/2 dx1 ,

e2 = eD/2 dx2 ,

(B.45)

for some function D of y, x1, x2 (which is ultimately identified with the function D in the canonical LLM form). Once this choice for e1, e2 is made, the various components of the equation (B.44) can be studied separately and yield the following results. Firstly, the warp factor is determined by the function D by the expression (2.44). Secondly, the  dependence of the rescaled spinor is determined to be



=

-

i 2

.

(B.46)

Finally, the quantities vi in the metric (B.29) are fixed in terms of the function D as

v2

(B.47)

Toda Equation and Final Form of the 2-form F . The relation (B.26) and the form of the metric (B.29) imply that

1 := (¯ ) dy = cos2  D = (1 - y2 e-6) D .

(B.48)

On the one hand, the 2-form d1 is readily computed from this expression for 1. On the other hand, the BPS equations (B.21) imply the following equation for d1,

d1

=

-2 i

·

1 2

(¯ 

) dy  dy - e-3-2A (¯5

)F .

(B.49)

The components of ¯ are constrained by the projection conditions (B.34). For example, we have 2 = -i 1 and ¯1 = -i ¯2, and therefore

¯y 1 = -(¯1) y = i ¯2 y = -i ¯y (2 ) - ¯y 1 ,

(B.50)

which shows that ¯y 1 = 0. By similar arguments, one verifies that the only independent non-zero components of ¯ are

¯12 = -i , ¯y = -i sin  .

(B.51)

­ 55 ­

This information, combined with the expressions (B.31), (B.33) for A and F , allows us to make a direct comparison between the relation (B.49) for d1 and the actual value of d1 as computed from (B.48). The dx1  dx2 piece of the resulting 2-form equation, using (B.47), implies the Toda equation for D (2.45).
Having established that D satisfies the Toda equation, we can revisit the expression (B.33) for F and make use of the identity

Using (B.12) and (B.15), this expression for F implies that G4 is given by the expression quoted in (2.43).

B.2.2 The Calibration 2-form Y

The calibration 2-form for supersymmetric M2-branes was identified in [38] for the most gen-

eral AdS5 solution preserving 4d N = 1 superconformal symmetry, as classified by Gauntlett,

Martelli, Sparks, and Waldram (GMSW) [39]. In order to apply the results of [38] to a solution

preserving 4d N = 2 superconformal symmetry, we select a linear combination  of the two

LLM spinors I in (B.20), and we identify  with the Killing spinor of the general GMSW

solution,

 = cI I = (1 + 7) (cI I  ) ,

(B.54)

where we have used a = -1 and cI are complex constants. Before proceeding, it is useful to collect some identities about bilinears of the S2 Killing spinors I. We set ¯I = (I). A
basis I of solutions to (B.18) can always be chosen, in such a way that13

¯I J = IJ , ¯I x J = -KxA (A)J I ,

¯I 3 J = y^A (A)J I , ¯I x 3 J = i xy^A (A)J I .

(B.55)

In the previous relations x = 1, 2 is a curved index on S2. The Pauli matrices on the LHSs play the role of gamma matrices on S2. The Pauli matrices on the RHSs are invariant tensors of the su(2) = so(3) isometry algebra of S2, connecting the indices I, J = 1, 2 in the fundamental
representation of su(2) to the indices A = 1, 2, 3 in the vector representation of so(3). The three quantities y^A are real scalars in S2, identified with the Cartesian coordinates of R3 in the standard embedding S2  R3. The metric on S2 is given in terms of y^A by

gxy = xy^A yy^A .

(B.56)

13In checking these relations, we have adopted the explicit expressions for Killing spinors on spheres of [79].

­ 56 ­

(The A indices in are raised/lowered with .) The 1-forms KxA are defined as KxA = ABC y^B xy^C ,

(B.57)

and yield the standard Killing vectors on S2 after raising their curved index x with the S2

metric. The 1-forms KxA can also be written as Hodge duals of the gradients of y^A, because

xy KxA = xy^A, where 12 = detgxy.

In order to preserve the normalization condition   = 2 of [39], the constants cI and their

complex conjugates c¯I should satisfy cI c¯I = 1. A choice of cI determines a vector nA in R3

via the formula

nA = cJ (A)J I c¯I .

(B.58)

Without loss of generality, we can select cI = (1, 0) in such a way that the 3-vector nA points

in the direction A = 3. (Any other choice is related by the action of the isometry group of

S2.) With this choice we have

y^A nA = y^A=3   .

(B.59)

The quantity  lies in [-1, 1]. The other two real scalars y^A=1, y^A=2 are parametrized as

y^A=1 = 1 -  2 cos  , y^A=2 = 1 -  2 sin  ,

(B.60)

where  is an angle of periodicity 2. The metric on S2 is written in terms of  and  in (2.59). We are now in a position to discuss the calibration 2-form. It is given as

Y

.

(B.61)

Making use of (B.54) this 2-form can be written in LLM setups as

Ymn = (c¯J ¯J  ¯) mn 7 (cI I  ¯) .

(B.62)

Using (B.14), (B.16), (B.55), we can write the 2-form Y as

Y = -e2A (c¯I cI ) (¯5 ) volS2 + eA d(y^A nA)  (¯ ) dy

+

B.2.3 R-symmetry Charges of Wrapped M2-branes
The R-symmetry charges of wrapped M2-brane operators can be extracted using the WessZumino coupling of M2-branes to C3, as in [38]. To this end, we need to introduce external background gauge fields in G4. This is accomplished in the construction of E4 in section ??. The final result is repeated here for convenience,

(B.67)

The 0-forms 0, 0 are defined in (3.4). If all external gauge fields are turned off, E4 reduces to G4, which is related to the background G4 by the relation (2.34). As a result, we can write

Gt4ot = -(2 p)3 E4 ,

(B.68)

where Gt4ot denotes the background G4-flux dressed with external background gauge fields, written in the same normalization used in the main text in giving the solution, cfr. (2.24). To

proceed, let us write

Gt4ot = G4 + dC3 ,

(B.69)

where C3 collects all terms that contain external gauge fields. For the computation at hand, we only need to retain terms linear in the external gauge fields inside C3. In the conventions we are adopting, the coupling of an M2-brane to C3 fluctuations is given by

Plugging this expression in (B.70) we can write the relevant couplings for the two supersymmetric M2-brane probes discussed in the main text. For the probe associated to O2i , it is convenient to write C3 in terms of d, Dz. The results are

(B.74)

We have used W1 to denote the worldline of the M2-brane in external spacetime. In the computation for O2i , we have assigned positive orientation to dw  Dz. The quantities y^a are the R3 embedding coordinates of the point on S2 where the M2-brane probe sits. As verified
in section 2.4.2, the brane sits at the north pole of S2, hence

y^A = (0, 0, 1) ,

y^a AA = AA=3 .

(B.75)

In what follows, we turn offthe gauge fields AA=1,2, leaving only a non-zero Aa=3. Using y^1 = 1 -  2 cos , y^2 = 1 -  2 sin , y^3 =  , we verify that the gauging prescription dy^A  Dy^A = dy^A - ABC AC y^B is equivalent to

d  d + A , A  AA=3 .

(B.76)

This relation confirms the identification of the Killing vector  with the Cartan generator of so(3)R = su(2)R, and states our normalization for the associated U (1) gauge field A.
To match with the normalization conventions of (2.68), we define appropriately rescaled versions of A, A, denoted Ar, AR,

We have also given the identification between the generators r, R and the Killing vectors ,
 (by slight abuse of notation, we use the symbols r, R both for the abstract generators and for the charges of a given operator). Notice that the relation between Ar and A is compatible
with (3.26) since c1(U (1)r) = dAr/(2). The charges r, R of the operators O1, O2i are now read off from the M2-brane action, SM2  W1(r Ar + R AR). We reproduce the charges given in (2.68) in the main text.

C Anomaly Polynomial in Class S

In this section we review the anomaly polynomial for four-dimensional N = 2 SCFTs that belong to class S.
Consider an N = 2 SCFT with U (1)r × SU (2)R R-symmetry, and flavor symmetry F . Denote the R-symmetry generators by r and Ia, with I3 the generator of the Cartan subgroup of SU (2)R. The anomaly polynomial for the theory takes the form

I6 = (nv - nh)

(cr1)3 - cr1p1(T 4)

3

12

- nvcr1cR2 - kF cr1ch2(F ) .

(C.1)

This form follows from the N = 2 superconformal algebra [80]. In this expression, cr1 is the first Chern class for the U (1)r bundle, cR2 is the second Chern class for the SU (2)R bundle, and ch2(F ) is the two-form part of the Chern character for the flavor symmetry bundle, given for an SU (m) flavor group as ch2(SU (m))) = -c2(SU (m)). The parameters nv and nh represent an effective number of vector and hypermultiplets respectively, coinciding with the
actual number when the theory is weakly coupled. These are given in terms of the anomaly
coefficients and a, c central charges as

tr r3 = tr r = 2(nv - nh) = 48(a - c) ,

tr rIaIb

=

ab

nv 2

=

ab2(2a - c)

One can equivalently express the central charges in terms of nv, nh as

,

c

(nh

(C.4)

The flavor central charge kF is defined in terms of the flavor symmetry group generators T a as

kF ab = -2 tr rT aT b .

(C.5)

Let us now review the contributions to the anomaly polynomial for the theories of class S of AN-1 type that is obtained by wrapping N M5-branes on a Riemann surface g,n with genus-g and n regular punctures. The contributions can be split into a "bulk" term which we

­ 60 ­

denote with a g,n argument, and a "local" term associated to each regular puncture on the Riemann surface labeled by the Young diagram Y, as [81]

n
I6 = I6(g,n) + I6(Y) .

(C.6)

The bulk contribution is proportional to the Euler characteristic (g,n) of the Riemann surface, and is given (using the parameterization (C.1)) by [73, 82]

The local contributions due to regular punctures on the Riemann surface can be given in

terms of the data of the Young tableaux that labels the puncture. Our notation follows [36].

Let ~i denote the lengths of the i = 1, . . . , p~ rows, with p~ the total number of rows. Denote

k~i = ~i - ~i+1 the differences between adjacent rows, where here we are using a convention in

which the lengths of rows increases from top to bottom of the diagram, so ~1  ~2  . . . . We

also define N~i =

i j=1

~j ,

such

that

N~p~

=

N.

The

associated

flavor

symmetry

is

S(

i U (k~i)).

In terms of this data, the contribution to the central charges of the regular puncture labeled

by Y is given as [12, 83]

D Landscape of Argyres-Douglas Theories
In this appendix we review the landscape of four-dimensional Argyres-Douglas theories, and their construction via geometric engineering.
D.1 Construction in Class S
A large class of four-dimensional quantum field theories known as class S are obtained by compactifying the 6d N = (2, 0) SCFTs on a genus-g Riemann surface with punctures, while implementing a partial topological twist in order to preserve some supersymmetry in four dimensions. 4d N = 2 SCFTs engineered in this way were first studied and classified in [6, 7], building on [5]. The parent (2,0) theories are labeled by an algebra g which follows an ADE classification, and which upon circle compactification reduces to the gauge algebra of the lowenergy 5d supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.14 The case relevant to this work is g = su(N ) ­ namely, the theories of type G = AN-1 which arise on the worldvolume of N M5-branes [84, 85].
The choice of punctures on the Riemann surface leads to a great variety of possible 4d SCFTs that can be geometrically engineered in this manner. From the perspective of the 6d (2,0) theory, punctures are 1/2-BPS codimension-two defects that extend over 4d spacetime. They correspond to singular boundary conditions of the Hitchin equations on the Riemann surface ­ which arise as the BPS equations of the (2,0) theory compactified on a circle and then twisted over the Riemann surface ­ and are classified by consistent boundary conditions of the Higgs field in the Hitchin system. There is a distinction between regular punctures (or tame defects) for which the pole of the Higgs field is simple, and irregular punctures (or wild defects) with higher order poles, to be reviewed in more detail below. The classification of regular punctures was studied for g = su(N ) in [6, 12], with possibilities labeled by partitions of N , or equivalently Young Tableaux with N boxes. More generally, regular punctures are labeled by an embedding of su(2) into g, corresponding to nilpotent orbits in g (e.g. see [83]). The contributions to the a and c central charges of these regular punctures was obtained in [12, 83] for the AN-1 case, and in [86] for the general ADE case. The holographic duals of the 4d N = 2 SCFTs of type AN-1 in class S involving only regular punctures are known, and are given by the 11d supergravity solutions of Gaiotto and Maldacena [12].
The classification of consistent irregular-type singularities of the Higgs field in the Hitchin system was undertaken in [9] (for AN-1) and [10] (for types D and E), building on [7]. These are labeled by the group G with algebra g, as well as by two integers b > 0 and k > -b, and so following [60] we denote the irregular puncture with these labels by G(b)[k]. In order to engineer a superconformal field theory by wrapping the (2,0) theory on a Riemann surface with irregular punctures, there are precisely two possibilities [9, 10]: the Riemann surface is a sphere with a single irregular puncture, or the Riemann surface is a sphere with one irregular puncture and one regular puncture (see also [7, 8, 87] for earlier constructions involving A1). This is in contrast to geometric engineering with only regular punctures, for which an almost
14 Below we use g and G interchangeably to refer to the QFT labeled by g.

unlimited number and variety of regular punctures can decorate a Riemann surface of any genus (with caveats at low genus g = 0, 1) and flow to an SCFT at low energies.

D.2 Survey of Generalized Argyres-Douglas SCFTs

The Argyres-Douglas SCFTs are intrinsically strongly-coupled 4d N = 2 SCFTs with Coulomb

branch operators of fractional scaling dimension, that are also notable for possessing relevant

deformations. The original theory of this type was discovered by Argyres and Douglas in [1],

where it was obtained as a special point on the moduli space of N = 2 pure SU (3) gauge

theory where mutually non-local BPS states simultaneously become massless.15 This original

Argyres-Douglas SCFT has rank-one, with a single Coulomb branch operator of dimension



=

6 5

and

no

flavor

symmetry.

A larger class of SCFTs of this type were obtained in [3] at the maximal conformal point

on the moduli space of N = 2 pure SU (k) super Yang-Mills with k  3. These generalized

Argyres-Douglas theories are denoted (A1, Ak-1), with the case k = 3 corresponding to the

original Argyres-Douglas theory (also sometimes denoted by H0 in the literature). The case

k = 4 ­ also called H1 in the literature ­ is also notable for being rank-one, with a single

Coulomb branch operator of dimension

4 3

.

The theories in this series with odd k have no

flavor symmetry, while those with even k possess a U (1) global symmetry which is enhanced

to SU (2) for k = 4 [88].16

The (A1, Ak-1) theories belong to a more general set of 4d N = 2 SCFTs which can be obtained via Type IIB string theory on a class of isolated hypersurface singularities labeled by

(G, G ) (with the theories of type (G, G ) are equivalent so those of type (G , G)) [55]. The IIB

background takes the form of an arbitrary closed four-manifold times a non-compact Calabi-

Yau threefold with an isolated singularity given by the sum of two singularities Pg(x, y) + Pg (w, z)=0, where each (g, g ) is of ADE type. (Note that the cases G = A1 with G = DE were first studied in [3, 89].) Another special case is the class (A1, Dk) that arises from the maximal conformal point on the moduli space of N = 2 SO(2k) gauge theory [3], which

can also be obtained via a relevant deformation to the maximal superconformal point of the

SU (k - 1) theory with two fundamental hypermultiplets [8]. The (A1, Dk) theories with kodd have an SU (2) flavor symmetry, while those with k-even have an SU (2) × U (1) flavor

symmetry that is enhanced to SU (3) for k = 4 [88].

A subset of the (G, G ) theories can be engineered in class S using irregular punctures.

One set with this property is the class (G, Ak-1), which can be engineered from the 6d (2,0) theory of type g wrapped on a Riemann surface with an irregular puncture of type G(b=hG)[k],

where hG is the dual Coxeter number of G. For example, taking G = AN-1 with hG = N
yields the class (AN-1, Ak-1), which can be engineered from N M5-branes wrapping a sphere with one irregular puncture of type A(NN-)1[k] [9, 10], which is the case of interest in the present work.

15 See also [2] for a construction involving SU (2) Nf = 1 SQCD, and generalizations for Nf > 1. 16 This even versus odd difference is also apparent from (4.7).

D.3 Classification of Irregular Singularities

Let us now review pertinent aspects of the classification of irregular singularities given in [9, 10]--also see [90] for a nice review of these properties.
We consider a 4d N = 2 theory engineered by twisting the 6d (2,0) theory of type g over a Riemann surface C with punctures. Let z denote a local holomorphic coordinate on C. By further compactifying on a circle, at low energies one obtains a 3d theory with N = 4 supersymmetry. One can instead reverse the order of the compactification, first reducing the 6d theory on a circle to obtain 5d N = 2 super Yang-Mills, and then twisting the 5d theory over C. The BPS equations of this configuration are the Hitchin equations for the holomorphic (1, 0)-form Higgs field  = zdz that comprises two of the adjoint scalars of 5d maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills, and the gauge field A = Azdz + Az¯dz¯, both of which are valued in the Lie algebra g [91]. The space of solutions to these equations modulo gauge transformations is the Hitchin moduli space, which is identified by mirror symmetry with both the Higgs branch of the 5d theory, and the Coulomb branch of the 3d theory from the reverse-order compactification. The interplay of the 4d N = 2 theory and the Hitchin system was studied in detail in [7].
At punctures the fields  and A are singular, and one must specify their boundary conditions.  = zdz can be put into semisimple form by a gauge transformation,

z (z )

k+b m=0

Tm-b

(D.1)

where in (D.1) we have placed the defect at z = 0 on C. The defining data of the defect

is the set (T, k, b), where the {T-b, . . . , Tk} are semisimple elements of the Lie algebra g, b is a positive integer, and k is an integer satisfying k > -b. As indicated in Section D, the

defect with these labels is denoted G(b)[k]. Evidently the order  of the leading pole in (D.1)

in

case

the

puncture is characterized the choice of T , which is a nilpotent element of the Lie algebra g. By

contrast, the case of a higher order pole k + b > 0 corresponds to an irregular puncture. In a

nice class of solutions, the T are regular semisimple elements of the Lie algebra, with restricted

values of b that are one-to-one with the three-fold isolated quasi-homogeneous singularities

of compound du Val type (see Table 1 of [10]). For the G = AN-1 case, this translates into

a choice of b = N or N - 1, denoted respectively as Type I and Type II in the notation of

[9, 10].17

The resulting 4d SCFTs preserve N = 2 supersymmetry when the Riemann surface is

a sphere [9]. One can also add a single regular puncture to the sphere while preserving

supersymmetry, resulting in the theories of Type IV in the notation of [9], which are also

denoted by their two punctures as (G(b)[k], Y ) with Y the Young diagram labeling the regular

puncture. The examples pertinent to this note arise from N M5-branes wrapping a sphere with

17 There is also a Type III singularity, which is a special case of Type I characterized by a nested Young Tableaux structure in T that we will not discuss here--also see [11].

­ 64 ­

an irregular puncture of type A(Nb=-N1 )[k] ­ which alone correspond to the (AN-1, Ak-1) SCFTs discussed above ­ with an additional regular puncture whose Young diagram consists of a box
with columns and N/ rows, contributing an SU ( ) flavor symmetry. We denote the resulting field theories by (A(NN-)1[k], Y ). One example of this class is to take the regular puncture to be maximal, with Young diagram consisting of a single row of length N ( = N ) contributing an SU (N ) flavor symmetry. These are also known as the Dpb==Nk+N (SU (N )) theories, and were studied in [56­58]. The case = 1 is the "non-puncture", reducing to the (AN-1, Ak-1) class
with no regular puncture on the sphere.

E Lagrangian Description of the (A(NN-)1[k], Y1) SCFTs

In this appendix, we review the RG flow described in [25, 26] between quiver Lagrangians that

ends at the (AN-1, A(k=mN)-1) ( = 1) theories at low energies.

One begins with an N = 2 conformal quiver gauge theory with gauge group

N -1 =1

S

U

(lm).

The quiver is depicted at the top of Figure 7.18 The quiver has N - 1 nodes corresponding

to the l = 1, . . . , N - 1 gauge groups, and one final node associated to an SU (mN = k)

flavor symmetry. Each gauge node has an N = 2 vector multiplet with associated N = 1

chiral multiplet l that transforms in the adjoint representation of the SU (lm) gauge group. Bifundamental hypermultiplets Hl = (Ql, Q~l) connect the nodes, with Ql transforming in the ( , ) and Q~l in the ( , ) of the adjacent SU (lm) × SU ((l + 1)m) gauge groups. At the final
gauge node, mN hypermultiplets HN-1 transform in the fundamental representation of the
SU (m(N - 1)) gauge group, and resulting in an SU (mN ) flavor symmetry. The quiver is thus

balanced, since the number of colors nl = lm satisfies 2nl -nl-1 -nl+1 = 0 at each node except the last, where 2(m(N - 1)) - m(N - 2) = mN the number of fundamental hypermultiplets

at that node. Indeed this is by construction, since the quiver is built by successively adding

(l + 1)m hypermultiplets to the l'th gauge node, and gauging the resulting SU ((l + 1)m) flavor

symmetry.

Denote the scalar chiral primary operators at the bottom of the SU (lm) would-be flavor

current multiplets ­ i.e., the SU (lm) moment map operators ­ by (µl, µ~l-1), with the µl formed

from the Hl hypermultiplets and the µ~l-1 formed from the Hl-1 hypermultiplets at that node.

For example, we are treating Ql as an lm × (l + 1)m matrix and Q~l as an (l + 1)m × lm matrix,

with

µl

= QlQ~l -

1 lm

tr

QlQ~l.

There

that

vector multiplets and moment map operators as

(E.1)

where in writing (E.1) we have defined µ~0 = 0.

18 The dictionary with [25] is: mthem = N , and Nthem = m. The dictionary with [26] is: kthem = N - 1, Nthem = m, r = Mj=mN-1-r, and they refer to the (Q, Q~) bifundamentals as (b, ~b).

The charges of the fields are listed in Table 2. The UV N = 2 SCFT has an R-symmetry SU (2)RUV × U (1)rUV, whose Cartan generators (IU3 V, rUV) we denote

J+ = 2IU3 V ,

J- = rUV .

(E.2)

(We reserve the labels (I3, r) without subscripts for the R-symmetry of the Argyres-Douglas SCFTs at the end of the flow.) Note that each hypermultiplet Hl comes with a baryonic U (1)l global symmetry under which the (Ql, Q~l) have charges ±1, since only the SU (ml) part of the U (ml) global symmetry acting on the hypermultiplets has been gauged in the construction of the quiver.
Now introduce an N = 1 chiral multiplet M that transforms in the adjoint representation of the SU (mN ) flavor symmetry group, and couple it to the moment map operator µ~N-1 of

­ 66 ­

SU (mN ) via the superpotential

W = tr µ~N-1M .

(E.3)

This superpotential breaks the N = 2 supersymmetry to N = 1, with the N = 1 R-symmetry corresponding to the subalgebra19

RN =1

=

1 3

(2J+

+

J-)

.

(E.5)

The moment map operator µ~N-1  QN-1Q~N-1 has charges (J+, J-) = (2, 0), and M has charges (0, 2), such that the superpotential W has charge RN =1(W ) = 2.
Next give M a nilpotent VEV M which corresponds to the principal embedding of su(2) into the flavor symmetry algebra su(mN ), completely breaking the SU (mN ) global symmetry. Explicitly, M is given by the mN × mN matrix with 1's along the entire upper diagonal. Using results from [69] (based on the methods of [67]), one can show that many of the modes decouple in the IR, including Nambu-Goldstone modes corresponding to broken flavor symmetry generators, and chiral multiplets that become massive due to the VEV, resulting in a "fan" superpotential. Decomposing the adjoint indices of the operators M and µ~N-1 in terms (j, m) indices of the principal embedding of su(2), and denoting by M~j,m the fluctuations about the vev M in this basis, the result is that the only modes M~j,m that remain coupled at low energies are those with lowest weight m = -j and j = 1, . . . , mN - 1. The remaining superpotential takes the form

mN -1

W = (µ~N-1)1,-1 +

M~ jµ^j ,

j=1

M~ j  M~ j,m=-j ,

µ^j  (µ~N-1)j,m=j .

(E.6)

Due to the first term, the J- charge shifts to J- = J- - 2(3) while the J+ charge remains unshifted, J+ = J+, such that the superpotential has (J+, J-) = (2, 2). Then, (J+, J-)(M~j) = (0, 2 + 2j), and (J+, J-)(µ^j) = (2, -2j).
Of the mN pairs of fundamental quarks (antiquarks) in the fundamental (anti-fundamental)
representation of the SU (m(N - 1)) gauge symmetry, all but one pair which we denote (q, q~)
receive a mass due to the VEV M . The charges of (q, q~) are (J+, J-)(q, q~) = (1, 1 - mN ). The remaining mN - 1 components µ^j of the SU (mN ) moment map correspond to traces of products of qq~ with powers of the vector multiplet N-1,

µ^j = tr qNmN-1-1-j q~ ,

j = 1, . . . , mN - 1 .

(E.7)

The field content and charges after removing all of the decoupled modes and massive fields is summarized in Table 3, and the IR quiver is depicted at the bottom of Figure 7.

After Higgsing, the N = 1 theory flows to a fixed point whose superconformal R-symmetry is given by a linear combination of J+ and J- that is determined by a-maximization [92],

Performing

a-maximization,

the

authors

of

[25, 26] find that various gauge-invariant operators seemingly violate the unitarity bound,

and thus decouple as free fields acted on by an accidental U (1) global symmetry [93]. The

operators that decouple are tr il with i = 2, . . . , m + 1 and l = 2, . . . , N - 1, and tr il=1 with i = 2, . . . , m, along with the gauge singlets M~j with j = 1, . . . , m. After decoupling all the

necessary fields and repeating the a-maximization procedure, IR is determined as

IR

3m + 1 3(m + 1)

,

IR < 1 .

(E.9)

The dimensions of chiral operators at the IR fixed point are thus given by (

Computing the central charges at the fixed point, the authors of [25, 26] find agreement with

(4.20).

One can verify that every term has (J+, J-) = (2, 2) and thus RN =1 = 2. We have included the flipping fields l,i that enforce decoupling of the operators tr i that become free [94], whose charges are listed in Table 3.
The IR fixed point is identified with the (AN-1, A(k=mN)-1) theories whose properties are reviewed in Section 4.1 (also see Table 1 for a summary). In particular, the R-symmetry at the fixed point is expected to enhance to SU (2)R × U (1)r, with Cartan generators (I3 = R/2, r) identified as

r

Table 3: The charges of fields in the Lagrangian description of the (AN-1, A(k=mN)-1) theories. The gauge group and matter content with l = N - 1 have been singled out, such
that in the table l runs over 1, . . . , N - 2. The columns before the double vertical lines are
the gauge groups in the quiver, and the remaining three columns are the baryonic global symmetries and R-charges. The operators M~j that remain coupled at the fixed point have j = m + 1, . . . , mN - 1. The singlets l,i are flipping fields, where for l = 1 i runs over 2, . . . , m, and for l = 2, . . . , N - 1 i runs over 2, . . . , m + 1.

where the U (1)l are baryonic. One can verify that the following properties of this Lagrangian SCFT match onto those
of the (AN-1, A(k=mN)-1) theories, as summarized in Table 1 (with = 1):

Mj=i-1 i = m + 2, . . . , N m ; l = N

(E.15)

· One can also identify the superpartners Ol,i of the Coulomb branch operators that correspond to the level-two descendants of the N = 2 chiral multiplet whose primary
is u ,i. Their dimensions satisfy (Ol,i) = (ul,i) + 1, and their N = 2 R-charges are

­ 69 ­

r(Ol,i) = r(ul,i) - 2, and R(Ol,i) = 2. The authors of [26] find that the (N - 1)(m - 1) operators l,i with l = 1, . . . , N - 1 and i = 2, . . . , m map to O operators, which are
paired with Coulomb branch operators as

{l-1,2m+2-i}  {ul,i} , i = m + 2, . . . , 2m , l = 2, . . . , N .

l = 2, . . . , N - 1 .

(E.17)

These are in correspondence with the N - 1 mass deformations of the Argyres-Douglas SCFTs [26].
An additional 2(2N-1 - 1) Higgs branch operators correspond to baryons composed of gauge invariant products of N - 1 quarks and adjoints, and have dimension [26]
