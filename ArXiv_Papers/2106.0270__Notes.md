## Abstract

We introduce double Courant-Dorfman algebras, which are noncommutative versions of Roytenberg's Courant-Dorfman algebras, since we prove that they satisfy the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle. In addition, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between double Courant-Dorfman algebras and double Poisson vertex algebras, as introduced by De Sole, Kac and Valeri. This at the same time provides a vertex version of Van den Bergh's construction of double Poisson algebras, as well as a noncommutative version of the correspondence between Poisson vertex algebras and Courant-Dorfman algebras.
