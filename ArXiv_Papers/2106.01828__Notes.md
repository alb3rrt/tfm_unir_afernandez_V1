## Abstract

In past decades, ultrafast spin dynamics in magnetic systems have been associated with heat deposition from high energy laser pulses, limiting the selective access to spin order. Here we use a long wavelength terahertz pump optical probe setup to measure structural features in the ultrafast time scale. We find that complete demagnetisation is possible with <6 THz pulses. This occurs concurrently with longitudinal acoustic phonons and an electronic response, followed by the magnetic response. The required fluence for full demagnetisation is low, ruling out the necessity of a high power light source.
