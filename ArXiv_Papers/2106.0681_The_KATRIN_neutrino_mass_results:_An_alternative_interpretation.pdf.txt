The KATRIN neutrino mass results: An alternative interpretation
Robert Ehrlich1 1George Mason University, Fairfax, VA 22030
(Dated: June 3, 2021) The KATRIN experiment has recently reported a new upper limit to the mass of the electron neutrino of m < 0.8eV (90%CL), and a best value of m2 = 0.26 ± 0.34eV 2/c4 based on a fit to the observed tritium beta decay spectrum. Here another interpretation of their results is discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
The latest KATRIN result,[1] the first to achieve subeV sensitivity in the neutrino mass, was based on their first and second data-taking campaigns, and it comes two years after an initial result from 2019.[2] Those initial results were based on a fit to the experimental beta spectrum recorded at 27 set point energies, using these four free parameters: the signal amplitude As, the effective -decay end point E0, the background rate Rbg, and the neutrino mass square m2. Four free parameters had then been considered the appropriate choice for doing a "shape-only" fit. In contrast to that initial result, the result reported in May 2021 fit the observed spectrum using 37 free parameters. The implications of employing so many parameters, and the possible motivation for doing so are explored in this short paper.
II. FITTING THE BETA SPECTRUM
KATRIN and virtually all previous neutrino mass experiments have fit their observed spectra using a single effective electron neutrino mass, a choice justified by the small separation between the masses contributing to the electron neutrino, as stipulated in the standard neutrino mass model. In 2013, the author introduced a highly speculative 3 + 3 neutrino mass model derived from an analysis of SN 1987A data. The model postulated three active-sterile doublets having three specific masses: m1 = 4.0 ± 0.5eV, m2 = 21.4 ± 1.2eV, and m23  -0.2keV 2. [3] Although the model is highly exotic, and involves a "tachyonic" mass state, it has satisfied a number of empirical tests. [4] Note that the tachyonic doublet here has nothing to do with the negative m2 reported in some past neutrino mass experiments, which had another cause, [5] and certainly was not indicative of a tachyonic neutrino.

KATRIN, where it was claimed that the 3 + 3 model fit the data better than the conventional one of a single effective mass. [6] Regrettably, that paper was in error, since it relied on an anomaly seen in the data at E -E0  -20eV as evidence for the presence of a mass m2  20eV, and it therefore assumed too large a contribution to the spectrum from that mass. In fact, that anomaly near -20 eV was mainly due to final state distributions, and those preKATRIN experiments were simply not sensitive enough to properly test the 3 + 3 model, but they also did not contradict it.
To fit a beta spectrum using such unequal masses as in the 3 + 3 model one forms an incoherent sum of the spectra for each mass using appropriately chosen weighting factors. Independent of the 3 + 3 model evidence has been presented that the electron neutrino effective mass squared, defined in the usual way: m2i,eff = |Uij|2m2j , has the value -0.11eV 2.[7] With this constraint, if one of the three spectral contributions is stipulated, say that for the 4.0 eV mass, the other two immediately follow.
Following publication of KATRIN's first results in 2019 the author showed that they were consistent with his 3+3 model as well as the standard single effective mass model, but only for a narrow range of contributions for the 4.0 eV mass, specifically for  = |Ui,1|2 = 0.94 ± 0.02.[8] The need for a narrow range in  is illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows the difference in the integral spectra for the two models, computed based on phase space. Note that the same phase space function has been used for the m2 > 0 and m2 < 0 neutrino masses, and the spectra for both are assumed to vanish for E - E0 > 0.
A consequence of Fig. 1 is that if the data are well described by the 3 + 3 model, but they are fit to a single small effective mass, then one would expect to see two "bumps," that is, excess numbers of events (O(0.5%)) at a distance from E0 close to the two m2 > 0 masses in the model. The initial KATRIN results from 2019 were such that the statistical error bars were not small enough to clearly show whether these excesses were present, although the residuals for their best fit did show an indication they were. In fact, the ninth residual in their fit located at E - E0 = -23eV , which was consistent with the position of the left peak in Fig. 1, fell +2.5 above their best fit for a single effective mass.[8]. In ref.[8] it was also

For the 3 + 3 model three values of the contribution for the 4.0 eV mass are shown: 92%, 94% and 96%. Only for the 94% case are the two integral spectra everywhere within ±0.8% of each other. The graph shows the difference in the two integral spectra, because the integral spectrum is what KATRIN measures.
estimated that after about a year's worth of additional data the reduced error bars might allow a definitive test of the 3 + 3 model.
III. FITTING OR HIDING AN ELEPHANT
The mathematician John Von Neumann famously once said: "With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk." This quote was his humorous way of telling us to be suspicious of using too many free parameters in doing a fit. Despite Von Neumann's caution, the use of four parameters by KATRIN to fit its initial data was exactly appropriate. Raising the number of free parameters by two would certainly also have been justified when combining the data from the two campaigns, because in the second campaign they had reduced the background, so that data should use separate values for As and Rbg. However, as noted earlier, the most recent KATRIN fit has used not six free parameters, but 37. If four parameters are enough to fit an elephant, 37 are enough to fit (or hide) a whole herd

of elephants, all with their trunks wiggling.
As far as the identity of the free parameters KATRIN uses in fitting their spectrum, one of them is, of course, the square of the neutrino mass, and the other 36 are the signal AS,i, background RBg,i, and endpoint energy E0,i that describe the spectrum of those electrons striking each of the 12 concentric rings of radii ri on the detector surface. It is indeed possible that As,i, RBg,i and E0,i might vary for data recorded on different rings, so this choice of 37 free parameters is not without justification.
It is easy to show, however, that small systematic departures from the single mass spectrum may remain hidden if the number of free parameters used in the spectrum fit is 28 or more (28 being the number of set point energies KATRIN used for their fitting in ref. [1]. Thus, for example, let the free parameters be very small adjustments to the values of the nominal 28 set point energies. It is then obvious (based on Fig. 1) that If the data were exactly described by the 3 + 3 model, and the spacings between set point energies were each appropriately varied by only  0.5% then the single mass spectrum would give a near perfect fit to the data. Hence with this choice of free parameters any evidence for the "bumps" occurring at the two m2 > 0 masses in the model would be hidden by the 28-parameter fit.
Any other choice of free parameters that affect the spectral shape, like the one KATRIN made, could also hide those spectral features provided the free parameters chosen are not strongly correlated in terms of their impact on the spectrum. Thus, with as many as 37 parameters, small systematic excess numbers of events representing departures from the standard single mass spectrum may remain hidden. Such departures from the single mass spectrum could indicate new physics, including a strong or weak preference for the 3 + 3 model, or alternatively they could be just random noise, but without seeing the result of a six-parameter fit, we cannot know which of these possibilities is the case.
Given that KATRIN showed a four-parameter fit in their 2019 paper, it would seem plausible they did a similar six-parameter fit for their combination of the two campaigns just released, [1] and found it a very poor one, before resorting to a 37 free parameter fit. One therefore is led to wonder whether KATRIN's choice not to show the results of a six-parameter fit to the spectrum. and even acknowledge whether such a fit was done, might reflect a desire to accumulate more data before revealing a very interesting result.
