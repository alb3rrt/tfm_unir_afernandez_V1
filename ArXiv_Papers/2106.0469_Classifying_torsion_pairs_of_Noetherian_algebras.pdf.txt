CLASSIFYING TORSION PAIRS OF NOETHERIAN ALGEBRAS
OSAMU IYAMA AND YUTA KIMURA
Abstract. For a commutative Noetherian ring R and a module-finite R-algebra , we study the set tors  of torsion classes of the category of finitely generated -modules. We construct an embedding  from tors  to TR() := p tors( R (p)), where p runs all prime ideals of R. When  = R, this gives Gabriel's classification of torsion classes and Serre subcategories of mod R. We introduce a map rp,q from tors( R (p)) to tors( R (q)) for a pair p  q of prime ideals of R, and call {X p}  TR() compatible if rp,q(X p)  X q holds for such pair. We show that all elements in the image of  are compatible, and call (R, ) compatible if the converse holds. We study when (R, ) is compatible. We show that, if R is semi-local and dim R  1, then (R, ) is compatible. We also give a sufficient condition in terms of silting -modules. As an application, for a Dynkin quiver Q, (R, RQ) is compatible and we have a poset isomorphism tors RQ  Homposet(Spec R, CQ) for the Cambrian lattice CQ of Q.

1. Introduction
A torsion class (respectively, torsionfree class) is a full subcategory of an abelian category A which is closed under extensions and factor objects (respectively, subobjects). It appears naturally in several branches of mathematics and plays important roles. Among others, torsion classes in A are closely

related to derived equivalences of A. In fact, a torsion class often gives rise to a torsion pair (T , F), which corresponds bijectively with intermediate t-structure [BBD, BY] in the derived category Db(A).
When A is the category of (finitely generated) modules over a finite dimensional algebra A over a field, then a connection between torsion classes and classical tilting modules was well understood in the last century, see [ASS, Chapter VI. 6]. The recent development of tilting theory is often called as silting theory, where the notion of  -tilting modules (also called as silting modules) plays a central role as a completion of the classical tilting modules from a point of view of mutation, see e.g. [IT, AIR, BY, As1]. Silting theory was developed also for arbitrary rings [IJY] even in the setting of infinitely generated modules [AMV, An].
The notion of classical tilting modules is important for a number of rings, e.g. preprojective algebras and Calabi-Yau algebras [IR, BIRS], and plays a crucial role in the study of cluster tilting for CohenMacaulay modules and non-commutative crepant resolutions of singularities [IW1]. Therefore it will be very important to generalize silting theory to a more general class of rings. The aim of this paper is to continue to develop silting theory for Noetherian algebras recently studied in [Ki, Gn].
We explain our results in this paper. We say that a pair (R, ) is a Noetherian algebra if R is a commutative Noetherian ring and  is an R-algebra which is finitely generated as an R-module. We study the set tors  (respectively, tors(fl )) of torsion classes of the category mod  of finitely generated -modules (respectively, the category fl  of finite length -modules), and torf  (respectively, torf(fl )) the set of all torsionfree classes of mod  (respectively, fl ). These sets are partially ordered by inclusion. Our first result gives an isomorphism from torf  to a product of torf(fl p), and an embedding of tors  into a product of tors(fl p), where p runs all prime ideals of R. There are isomorphisms of posets
tors(fl p)  tors( R (p)), torf(fl p)  torf( R (p)),
for finite dimensional (p)-algebras  R (p) [Ki, Theorem 5.4] (see Proposition 2.32). Therefore in results below, we can describe the statements by using both of tors(fl p) and tors(R (p)) (respectively, torf(fl p) and torf( R (p))). We use the former one.

Theorem 1.1 (Theorem 3.4). For a Noetherian algebra (R, ), there is a commutative diagram

tors 



(-)

torf 

 

TR() := pSpec R tors(fl p)
(-)
FR() := pSpec R torf(fl p),

where  and the left (-) are injective,  and the right (-) are bijective. Both of  and  are given by C  {Cp  fl p}pSpec R. The map (-) means taking perpendicular categories with respect to
homomorphisms.

We apply Theorem 1.1 to a classification of Serre subcategories of mod . We denote by sim p the set of isomorphism classes of simple p-modules and regard

Sim :=

sim p

pSpec R

as a poset, where for S  sim p and T  sim q, we write S  T if and only if p  q and S is a subfactor of T as a q-module.

Corollary 1.2 (Theorem 3.18). For a Noetherian algebra (R, ), there is a bijection

serre  - {down-sets of Sim}

given by S  pSpec R(Sp  sim p).

As an easy application of Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.2, we obtain the following result, which immediately implies well-known results due to Gabriel et. al. for the case  = R.

Corollary 1.3 (Corollaries 3.9, 3.14, Proposition 3.16). For a Noetherian algebra (R, ), assume that p is Morita equivalent to a local ring for each p  Spec R. Then
(a) tors  = serre  holds, and tors  corresponds bijectively with the set of the specialization closed subsets of Spec R.
(b) torf  corresponds bijectively with the set of all subsets of Spec R.

For a general , the structure of tors  is much richer. For example, when  is the path algebra kQ of a Dynkin quiver Q over a field k, tors kQ parametrizes the clusters in the corresponding cluster algebra. The second aim of this paper is to characterize the elements of TR() corresponding to elements in tors . For each pair p  q in Spec R and X p  tors(fl p), we consider
X p := {X  mod p | gen X  fl p  X p}  tors p
and the map rp,q : tors(fl p) - tors(fl q), X p  (X p)q  fl q.
An element {X p}pSpec R in TR() = pSpec R tors(fl p) is called compatible if rp,q(X p)  X q holds for each pair p  q in Spec R.

Proposition 1.4 (Proposition 3.22). For a Noetherian algebra (R, ), any element in Im  is compatible. Thus we have an injective map

 : tors   {compatible elements in TR()}.

(1.1)

We call a Noetherian algebra (R, ) compatible if the map (1.1) is bijective. Even for the simplest case R = Z or a polynomial algebra k[x] over a field k, we think there should be an R-algebra  such that (R, ) is not compatible. We give sufficient conditions for (R, ) to be compatible.

Theorem 1.5 (Corollary 3.28). Let (R, ) be a Noetherian algebra. If R is semi-local and dim R = 1, then (R, ) is compatible.

We give other sufficient conditions of quite different type in terms of silting theory. In Subsection 2.1, we give characterizations of silting modules (that is, support  -tilting pairs in [IJY], and finitely generated silting modules in [AMV]). We denote by silt  the set of additively equivalence classes of silting -modules. Each M  silt  gives a torsion class gen M . We consider

s-tors(fl ) := {gen M  fl  | M  silt }  tors(fl )

(1.2)

and give the following criterion for compatibility.

Theorem 1.6 (Theorem 4.7). Let (R, ) be a Noetherian algebra such that (R, m) is local. Assume that the equality holds in (1.2), and the map rm,p is an isomorphism of posets for each p  Spec R. Then (R, ) is compatible. Moreover, we have an isomorphism of posets
tors   Homposet(Spec R, tors(fl )).

Notice that the condition s-tors(fl ) = tors(fl ) can be regarded as a generalization of  -tilting finiteness [DIJ] for finite dimensional algebras over a field. In fact, we prove the following result.

Theorem 1.7 (Theorem 4.3). Let (R, ) be a Noetherian algebra such that R is complete local. Then the following conditions are equivalent.
(i) s-tors(fl ) = tors(fl ). (ii)  tors(fl ) < . (iii)  2-silt  < .

In the last section, we give the following example.
Corollary 1.8 (Theorem 4.9). Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring and Q a Dynkin quiver. Then there is an isomorphism of posets
tors RQ  Homposet(Spec R, CQ),
where CQ is the Cambrian lattice of Q.
1.1. Notations and conventions. In this paper, all categories are assumed to be essentially small and all subcategories are assumed to be full and closed under isomorphisms.
Let A be a ring. We denote by Mod A (respectively, mod A, fp A, proj A, fl A) the category of (respectively, finitely generated, finitely presented, finitely generated projective, finite length) left A-modules and denote by Kb(proj A) the bounded homotopy category of proj A.
Let A be an additive category. For a subcategory B (or a collection of objects) of A, we denote by add B the full subcategory of A consisting of direct summands of finite direct sums of objects in B. Let BA = {X  A | HomA(B, X) = 0, B  B}. Similarly, AB is defined. If the category A is clear from the context, then we use the notion B and B for simplicity.
Let A be an abelian category and B a subcategory (or a collection of objects) of A. We denote by gen B the full subcategory of A consisting of factor objects of objects in add B. We denote by Filt B the subcategory of A consisting objects X such that there exists a finite filtration 0  X1      X = X and Xi/Xi-1 is an object of add B for each i.
Let C be an additive category and B be a subcategory of C. For an object C of C, a right B-approximation of C is a morphism f : B  C with B  B such that the map HomC(B, f ) is surjective for any object B of B. A left B-approximation is defined dually.
Let A be an abelian category and C a subcategory of A. We say that C is closed under extensions in A if for each short exact sequence 0  X  Y  Z  0 in A with X, Z  C, we have Y  C. We say that C is closed under factor objects (respectively, subobjects) in A if for each objects C of C, any factor objects of C in A (respectively, any subobjects of C in A) belongs to C.
Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring. An R-algebra  is a ring  with a ring homomorphism  : R   such that the image of  is contained in the center of . A Noetherian R-algebra (or, modulefinite R-algebra, Noetherian algebra) is an R-algebra  which is finitely generated as an R-module. For a prime ideal p of R, let (p) = Rp/pRp.

2. Silting theory and torsion classes
2.1. Characterization of silting modules. We first recall definitions of silting complexes and silting modules, and give many characterization of silting modules, which provides that our definition is valid for the definition given by [AMV], see Theorem 2.7. Throughout this subsection, let  be a ring with 1.
A thick closure thickT P of an object P in a triangulated category T is the smallest triangulated subcategory of T which is closed under direct summands and containing P . If the triangulated category T is clear from the context, we write thick P . Two objects X, Y in an additive category are said to be additively equivalent if add X = add Y holds.
Definition 2.1. Let P be an object in a triangulated category T .
(1) We say that P is presilting if HomT (P, P [i]) = 0 holds for any i > 0. (2) We say that P is silting if P is presilting and satisfies thick P = T .
A complex P = (di : Pi  Pi+1) in Kb(proj ) is said to be two-term if Pi = 0 for i = -1, 0.
Definition 2.2. Let  be a ring.

(1) A complex in Kb(proj ) is call a two-term silting complex of  if it is a silting object of Kb(proj ) and is a two-term complex. We denote by 2-silt  the set of additively equivalence classes of two-term silting complexes of . Similarly, we define two-term presilting complexes and denote by 2-psilt  the set of additively equivalence classes of two-term presilting complexes of .
(2) A -module M is said to be silting module if there is a two-term silting complex P of  such that H0(P ) = M . We denote by silt  the set of additively equivalence classes of silting -modules.
We give one proposition.
Proposition 2.3. An assignment P  H0(P ) gives a bijection
2-silt  - silt .
Proof. Clearly, the map is surjective. Assume that add H0(P ) = add H0(Q) holds for 2-term silting complexes P, Q of Kb(proj ). Then it is easy to see that P  Q is a silting complex. By [AI, Theorem 2.18], we have add P = add(P  Q) = add Q, that is, the map is injective.

By definition, our silting modules are finitely generated over . In the rest of this subsection, we give many characterization of silting modules. In particular, our definition of silting modules are precisely finitely generated silting modules in the sense of [AMV]. Moreover if  is a finite dimensional algebra over a field, then our silting modules are precisely support  -tilting modules introduced by Adachi-IyamaReiten [AIR], see Theorem 2.11.
For a -module M , we denote by Add M the subcategory of Mod  consisting of direct summands of (possibly infinite) direct sums of copies of M . We denote by Gen M the subcategory of Mod  consisting of factors of modules in Add M . Let gen M = Gen M  mod , where mod  is the category of finitely generated -modules. Let D() = D(Mod ) and K() = Kb(proj ).
Let P = (P -1 -f P 0)  K() be a two-term complex and M = H0(P ).

Lemma 2.4. A functor H0 : add P  add M is full and dense.

Proof. Clearly H0 is full. Since K() is idempotent complete by [IY, Theorem 2.9], H0 is dense.

For a two-term complex P = (P -1 -f P 0)  K(), let

TP = {X  Mod  | Hom(f, X) is surjective} = {X  Mod  | HomD()(P, X[1]) = 0}.

(2.1)

Lemma 2.5. TP is closed under factor modules, extensions, arbitrary direct products and arbitrary direct coproducts.

Proof. This directly follows from the equality (2.1) and that P -1 and P 0 belong to proj .

Proposition 2.6. For a two-term complex P = (P -1 -f P 0)  K() and M = H0(P ), the following statements are equivalent.
(i) P is a presilting complex. (ii) M belongs to TP .
Proof. Let N = H-1(P ). We have a triangle N [1]  P  M  N [2] in D(). By applying the functor HomD()(P [-1], -), we have HomD()(P [-1], P )  Coker(Hom(f, M )). This implies the assertion.
The following theorem gives various characterizations of silting modules.

Theorem 2.7. For a -module M , the following statements are equivalent. (i) M is a silting module, that is, there is P  2-silt  such that H0(P ) = M .

6

O. IYAMA AND Y. KIMURA

(i) There is P  2-silt  such that add H0(P ) = add M . (ii) There is P  2-psilt  such that H0(P ) = M with an exact sequence  -g M 0  M 1  0, where
g is a left TP -approximation and M 0, M 1  add M . (iii) There is P  2-psilt  such that H0(P ) = M with an exact sequence  -g M 0  M 1  0, where
g is a left (Gen M )-approximation and M 0, M 1  add M . (iv) There is P  2-psilt  such that H0(P ) = M with an exact sequence  -g M 0  M 1  0, where
g is a left (add M )-approximation and M 0, M 1  add M . (v) There is a two-term complex P  K() such that H0(P ) = M and TP = Gen M .

The statement (iv) is a variation of the definition of  -rigid pairs in [IJY, Definition 1.3], and a characterization of support  -tilting modules [J, Proposition 2.14] in the case where  is an Artinian algebra. The statement (v) (respectively, (ii)) is a finitely presented version of the definition (respectively, a characterization) of large silting modules in [AMV] (respectively, [AMV, Proposition 3.11]).

Remark 2.8. We can replace TP (respectively, Gen M , add M ) in (ii) (respectively, (iii), (iv)) by TP  mod  or TP  fp  (respectively, gen M , Add M ).
Proof of Theorem 2.7. (i) implies (i): Let C be the subcategory of add P consisting of objects Q such that H0(Q) = 0. By Lemma 2.4, H0 induces an equivalence (add P )/[C]  add M . Let P   add P such that H0(P )  M . By assumption, H0(P ) is a direct summand of M n  H0(P n) for some integer n. Then there is Q  add P such that H0(P  Q)  H0(P n). Since add P is a category with cancellation (which is also called weakly idempotent complete), there are U, V  C such that P  Q  U  P n  V by [H, Theorem 2.2]. This P  V is a two-term silting complex, since so is P QU . We have H0(P  V )  M .
(i) implies (ii): Take a triangle   Q0  Q1  [1] in D() with Q0, Q1  add P . By applying H0, we have an exact sequence  -g M 0  M 1  0 where M i = H0(Qi)  add M . Since HomD()(Q[-1], T ) = 0 for any T  TP , g is a right TP -approximation.
(ii) implies (iii): Clear from M  TP by Proposition 2.6 and Gen M  TP . (iii) implies (iv): Clear from add M  Gen M . (iv) implies (i): By Lemma 2.4, there is a morphism g :   Q0 in K() with H0(g) = g. Take a triangle  -g Q0  C  [1] in K(). By the following commutative diagram, g is a left (add P )-
approximation:

HomD()(Q0, P ) -g HomD()(, P )

H0



Hom(M 0, M ) -g Hom(, M )

Therefore P  C  2-silt  is a co-Bongartz completion of P and add H0(P  C) = add(M  M 1) = add M . (ii) implies (v): It is enough to show that TP  Gen M holds. Let X  TP . Take a surjective morphism
I  X with an index set I. Then this morphism factors through gI , where g is a morphism in Theorem 2.7 (ii). Thus X  Gen M holds.
(v) implies (iii): The module M is silting in the sense of [AMV, Definition 3.7]. Thus by [AMV,
Proposition 3.10], M is a finendo quasitilting module. By [AMV, Proposition 3.2], there is an exact sequence  -f M 0 -g M 1  0 such that M 0, M 1  Add M , f is a left (Gen M )-approximation. Let M 0  N 0 = M I for an index set I. By replacing g to g  idN0 : M 0  N 0  M 1  N 0, we may assume that M 0 = M I . Let J  I be a finite subset such that f (1)  M J . We have the following

where C is the cokernel of   M J and C is a finitely generated -module, since M J is finitely generated. We have a split short exact sequence 0  M J  C  M I  M 1  0. Therefore
C  Add M . By the following claim, we have C  add M . Thus the bottom sequence in the above
diagram gives Theorem 2.7 (iii).
We claim that for modules X, Y  Mod  with Y  Add X, if Y is finitely generated, then Y  add X holds. There are morphisms Y -a XI -b Y with an index set I such that ba = idY . Since Y is finitely generated, there is a finite subset J  I such that Im a  XJ holds. Let b be the restriction of b to XJ . We have ba = idY .

We give more characterizations of silting modules under certain assumptions on the ring . Recall that
a ring  is said to be semi-perfect if it admits a decomposition  = P1      Pn as a left -module such that each Pi has a local endomorphism ring. It is well-known that  is semi-perfect if and only if proj  is a Krull-Schmidt category. For more details of semi-perfect rings, see [CR, Kr].

Lemma 2.9. Assume that  is a semi-perfect ring. Let P = (P -1 -d P 0)  K() be a two-term complex such that d is right minimal. Let M = H0(P ). Then the following statements are equivalent.

(i) P is presilting. (ii) Ext1(M, Gen M ) = 0. (iii) Ext1(M, gen M ) = 0.

Proof. Assume that P is presilting. By Lemma 2.5 and Proposition 2.6, M  Gen M  TP holds. Thus Ext1(M, Gen M ) = 0 holds. Clearly (ii) implies (iii).
We show that (iii) implies (i). By Proposition 2.6, it is enough to show that M  TP . Let d : 2M  P -1 be the kernel morphism of d. For any morphism f : P -1  M , there are morphisms a : P 0  M and b : P -1  2M such that f = da + f db. Let x = db. Since d is right minimal, (idP -1 - x)  End(P -1) is a unit. We have f x = adx + f x2 = f x2 and f x(idP -1 - x) = 0. Thus f x = 0 and f = ad.

Theorem 2.10. Assume that  is semi-perfect. For a finitely presented -module M with a minimal projective presentation P of M , the following statements are equivalent to the statements (i) to (v) in
Theorems 2.7. (ii) Ext1(M, Gen M ) = 0 and there is an exact sequence  -g M 0  M 1  0, where g is a left TP -approximation and M 0, M 1  add M . (iii) Ext1(M, Gen M ) = 0 and there is an exact sequence  -g M 0  M 1  0, where g is a left (Gen M )-approximation and M 0, M 1  add M . (iv) Ext1(M, Gen M ) = 0 and there is an exact sequence  -g M 0  M 1  0, where g is a left (add M )-approximation and M 0, M 1  add M .

Proof. The claim directly follows from Lemma 2.9.

O. IYAMA AND Y. KIMURA

We denote by K2() the subcategory of K() consisting of two-term complexes. It is easy to see that if K2() is a Krull-Schmidt category, then so is the category of finitely presented -modules fp . For an object X of a Krull-Schmidt category, we denote by |X| the number of isomorphism classes of indecomposable direct summands of X.
Theorem 2.11. Assume that K2() is Krull-Schmidt and HomD()(X, Y ) is a finitely generated EndD()(Y )module for any complexes X, Y  K2(). Then for a -module M , the statements in Theorems 2.7 and 2.10 are equivalent to the following statement.
(vi) There is P  2-psilt  and an idempotent e   such that H0(P ) = M , eM = 0 and |M | = |/ e | hold.

Proof. Theorem 2.7 (iv) is equivalent to (vi) by [IJY, Theorem 4.6].

2.2. Localizations. Throughout this subsection, let R be a commutative Noetherian ring and  a Noetherian R-algebra. In this subsection, we give a basic properties of a localization functor (-)p for a prime ideal p of R. We denote by Spec R the set of all prime ideals of R. For an ideal I of R, we denote by V (I) the set of all prime ideals of R containing I. The set Spec R is a poset by inclusion, that is, q  p if q  p.
Let p be a prime ideal of R. We denote by Rp the localization of R at p. Let

p := Rp R ,

which is a Noetherian Rp-algebra. For a -module M , let Mp := Rp R M  p  M . We have an exact functor

(-)p = Rp R (-) : mod   mod p.

Since the functor is exact, we have Im(fp) = (Im f )p, Coker(fp) = (Coker f )p and Ker(fp) = (Ker f )p for a morphism f in mod . Let M, N be -modules and n  0 an integer. By [CR, (8.18) Corollary], the
functor (-)p induces an isomorphism

Rp R Extn(M, N )  Extnp(Mp, Np).

(2.2)

Since (-)p is exact, it induces a functor of triangulated categories

(-)p : Db(mod )  Db(mod p)

and this restricts to homotopy categories: Kb(proj )  Kb(proj p). Let X, Y  Db(mod ), i be an integer and put D() = D(Mod ). We have

Rp R HomD()(X, Y [i])  HomD(p)(Xp, Yp),
since HomD()(X, Y [i]) = Hi(RHom(X, Y )), (-)p is exact and (2.2). For a -module M , we denote by Supp M the support of M regarded as an R-module, that is,

(2.3)

Supp M = {p  Spec R | Mp = 0}.

We also recall that an associated prime ideal of M  mod R is a prime ideal p such that p = Ann(x) := {a  R | ax = 0} holds for some x  M . It is easy to see that p is an associated prime ideal of M if and only if there exists an injective morphism from R/p to M . We denote by Ass M the set of all associated prime ideals of M . It is known that Ass M  Supp M holds, and the minimal elements of Ass M coincide with the minimal elements of Supp M , see [Ma] for instance.
We observe some properties of simple and length finite -modules. Note that a -module X is finitely generated if and only if it is finitely generated as an R-module. It is well-known that an R-module M has a finite length if and only if Mp = 0 for any non-maximal prime ideal p of R.

Lemma 2.12. Let M be a -module. The following statements hold.

(a) M has a finite length as a -module if and only if M has a finite length as an R-module. (b) If (R, m) is a local ring and M has a finite length as a -module, then there exists a positive
integer  such that mM = 0.
Proof. (a) We show that a simple -module M has a finite length as an R-module. Since R/ AnnR M is a subring of a division ring End(M ), the annihilator AnnR M is a maximal ideal of R. This implies that the support of M is contained by the set of maximal ideals of R. Since M is a finitely generated R-module, M has a finite length as an R-module.
(b) By (a), M has a finite length as an R-module. In particular, if (R, m) is local, then there exists a positive integer  such that mM = 0 by Nakayama's lemma.
Lemma 2.13. For a prime ideal p of R and each p-module X, there exists a -module M such that Mp is isomorphic to X. Moreover, if X has finite length, then M can be chosen such that Ass M  {p} and Supp M  V (p).
Proof. The first statement directly follows from [CR, (23.13) Proposition]. Let M be a -module such that Mp is isomorphic to X. Assume that X has a finite length. Let M  = {x  M | (Rx)p = 0}. Then M  is a -submodule of M and Mp = 0. Thus we have (M/M )p  Mp. For any q  Ass(M/M ), we have (R/q)p  fl Rq \ {0}. Therefore Ass(M/M )  {p} holds.
2.3. Silting complexes over Noetherian algebras. In this subsection we observe some properties of silting complexes with respect to localization functors. Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring and  a Noetherian R-algebra.
For an interval I  Z, let KI (proj ) := {P  Kb(proj ) | P i = 0, i / I}. It is easy to see that for two complexes X, Y  Db(mod ), HomDb(mod )(X, Y ) is finitely generated over R.
Proposition 2.14. For a complex P  Kb(proj ), the following statements hold. (a) P is a presilting complex in Kb(proj ) if and only if Pp is a presilting complex in Kb(proj p) for any prime ideal p of R. (b) For an interval I  Z, P belongs to KI (proj ) if and only if Pp belongs to KI (proj p) for for any prime ideal p of R.
Proof. (a) The claim is immediate from (2.3). (b) Let I = [a, b]. Then P  KI (proj ) if and only if Hom(, P [i]) = 0 and Hom(P, [j]) = 0 for any
i > b and j > -a. By (2.3), this is equivalent to Hom(p, Pp[i])p = 0 and Hom(Pp, p[j]) = 0 for any i > b, j > -a and any prime ideal p of Spec R. The assertion holds.
The following is the main theorem of this subsection.
Theorem 2.15. For a complex P  Db(mod ), the following statements hold. (a) P  Kb(proj ) if and only if Pp  Kb(proj p) for any prime ideal p of R. (b) P is a silting complex in Kb(proj ) if and only if Pp is a silting complex in Kb(proj p) for any prime ideal p of R.
To show the theorem, we recall the following notion. Let C be an additive category and B be a subcategory of C. We say that B is contravariantly finite in C if every object of C admits a right B-approximation. A covariantly finite subcategory is defined dually. A subcategory of C is said to be functorially finite if it is both contravariantly and covariantly finite in C. For instance, if C = mod  or Kb(proj ), then add C is a functorially finite subcategory of C for any object C. For two subcategories (or collections of objects) X , Y of a triangulated category T , we denote by X  Y a subcategory of T consisting of objects T admitting a triangle X  T  Y  X[1] with X  X , Y  Y.

Assumption 2.16. Let P be a presilting object in a triangulated category T such that add P is a contravariantly finite subcategory of T . For X = X0  T such that HomT (P [i], X) = 0 for i < 0, define Xn+1 (n  0) by taking a right (add P [n])-approximation fn : Pn[n]  Xn and Xn+1 := Cone(fn).
Lemma 2.17. For objects P and Xn in T as Assumption 2.16, the following statements hold.
(a) If Xn  add P [n], then Xn+1  add P [n + 1] holds. (b) X belongs to thick P if and only if Xn  add P [n] holds for some integer n.
Proof. (a) If Xn belongs add P [n], then fn is a split epimorphism. Thus Cone(fn)  add Pn[n + 1]. (b) The "if" part is clear since X  P0  P1[1]      Pn[n]  Xn holds. Assume that X belongs to thick P .
Since P is presilting, (add P )(add P [1])   (add P [n]) is closed under direct summands [IY]. Thus there is an integer n and Qi  add P such that X  Q0  Q1[1]      Qn[n]. Then there is Y  Q1[1]      Qn[n] with the following commutative diagram

Q0

X

Y

Q0[1]

P0

X

X1

P0[1]

where each horizontal sequence is a triangle. The right side square gives a triangle Y  X1  Q0[1]  P0[1]  Y [1], which splits by HomT (P0, Y ) = 0. Therefore we have X1  add(Y  P0[1])  (add P [1])      (add P [n]). Repeat the same argument, we have Xn  add P [n].
Lemma 2.18. Let P be a presilting complex in Kb(proj ) and X  Db(mod ). Then X  thick P if and only if Xp  thick Pp holds for any prime ideal p of R.
Proof. It is suffices to show "if" part. Let T = Db(mod ). Without loss of generality, we may assume that HomT (P [i], X) = 0 for i < 0. Then P, X and T fit into Assumption 2.16. Let
In = {p  Spec R | (Xn)p / add Pp[n]}.
Consider a morphism of R-modules fn : HomT (Xn, Pn[n])  EndT (Xn) and let Cn = Coker(fn). Since Xn belongs to Db(mod ), EndT (Xn) and Cn belong to mod R. Then In = Supp Cn holds. In fact for a prime ideal p, (Cn)p = 0 if and only if (fn)p is a split epimorphism if and only if (Xn)p  add Pp[n] holds. Therefore In is a Zariski closed subset of Spec R. By applying Lemma 2.17(b) to Pp and Xp, we have n0 In = . Lemma 2.17(a) implies that In+1  In for any n  0. Since Spec R is a Noetherian space, there is an integer n such that In = . Thus Cn = 0 and fn is a split epimorphism. We have Xn  add P [n] and again by Lemma 2.17(b), the assertion holds.
Proof of Theorem 2.15. (a) By applying Lemma 2.18 to a silting complex   Kb(proj ) and a complex P  Db(mod ), we have that P  thick  if and only if Pp  thick p for any prime ideal p of R.
(b) By applying Lemma 2.18 to a silting complex P  Kb(proj ) and a complex   Db(mod ), we have that   thick P if and only if p  thick Pp for any prime ideal p of R.

As a corollary, we get the following result [IW2, Theorem 2.16] which is a non-commutative analogue of a result due to Bass.

Corollary 2.19. For X  mod , X has a finite projective dimension over  if and only if Xp has a finite projective dimension over p for any prime ideal p of R.
Proof. The assertion is immediate from Theorem 2.15(a).

We give one proposition giving a Noetherian algebra with trivial silting complexes.

Proposition 2.20. Assume that R is ring indecomposable and that p is Morita equivalent to a local ring for all prime ideal p of R. Then any silting complex T satisfies add T = add [i] in Kb(proj A) for some integer i.
Proof. For each p, Tp is a silting complex by Theorem 2.15. Since p is Morita equivalent to a local ring, there is an integer ip such that add Tp = add p[ip] holds [AI, Theorem 2.26]. For two prime ideals p  q of R, we have ip = iq. Since R is ring indecomposable, Spec R is connected, see [E, Exercise 2.25] for instance. This implies that ip is constant for any p. Namely, there is an integer i such that i = ip for any p. Therefore if j = i, then Hj(T ) = 0 and so T  Hi(T )[-i] holds. We have add T = add Hi(T )[-i] = add [-i].

In the rest of this subsection, we study (two-term) silting complexes under taking tensor products and quotients of algebras. If (R, m) is a local ring, we write X := X R (R/m) for a complex X  K() = Kb(proj ).
Lemma 2.21. Assume that (R, m) is a local ring. Let P, Q be two-term complexes of K() such that HomK()(P, Q[1]) = 0. Then the canonical map HomK()(P, Q)  HomK()(P , Q) is surjective.
Proof. Let P = (dP : P-1  P0) and Q = (dQ : Q-1  Q0). We denote by iP : Pi  P i a canonical morphism for i = 0, -1, and the same for iQ. Let f = (f-1, f0) : P  Q be a morphism in K(). It is easy to see that there are morphisms gi : Pi  Qi for i = 0, -1 such that fi  iP = iQ  gi holds. By this commutativity, we have -Q1(dQ  g-1 - g0  dP ) = 0. So the morphism dQ  g-1 - g0  dP belongs to m Hom(P-1, Q0) by [Ki, Lemma 4.1]. Since HomK()(P, Q[1]) = 0, we have Hom(P-1, Q0) = Hom(P0, Q0)  dP + dQ  Hom(P-1, Q-1). Therefore, there are morphisms   m Hom(P0, Q0) and   m Hom(P-1, Q-1) such that dQ  (g-1 + ) = (g0 + )  dP holds. Then (g-1 + , g0 + )  HomK()(P, Q) goes to f .
Proposition 2.22. Assume that (R, m) is a local ring and  is projective as an R-module. Let P be a two-term complex of K() such that P  2-silt . Then P is a silting complex.
Proof. Let K be a two-term complex such that K = 0. We have H0(K) = H0(K) = 0. Since  is projective as an R-module, we have H-1(K) = H-1(K) = 0. By Nakayama's lemma, we have K = 0. Therefore the functor (-) R (R/m) : K2(proj )  K2(proj ) is faithful. By [Ki, Proposition 4.2], P is presilting. Let P U be the co-Bongartz completion of P . Since P is a silting complex of , add U  add P holds. By Lemma 2.21, add U  add P holds. Namely, P is a silting complex.

We have the following property of two-term silting complexes, where R is not necessarily local.
Corollary 2.23. Assume that  is projective as an R-module. Then a two-term complex P of Kb(proj ) is a silting complex if and only if P LR (p) = P R (p) is a silting complex for any prime ideal p of R.
Proof. The "only if" part is easy. The "if" part follows from Theorem 2.15 and Proposition 2.22.
Lemma 2.24. Assume that  is projective as an R-module. Let P be presilting (respectively, silting) complex of Kb(proj ). Then for any commutative Noetherian R-algebra S, P R S is a presilting (respectively, silting) complex of Kb(proj  R S).
Proof. For a bounded complex X = R Hom(P, P ), we have Hi(X) = 0 for any i > 0. For projective modules M, N , we have Hom(M, N )R S  HomRS(M R S, N R S). So X R S = R HomRS(P R S, P R S) holds. Since  is projective as an R-module, we have Hi(X R S) = 0 for any i > 0. Namely, P R S is a presilting complex. It is easy to see that thick(P R S) = Kb(proj  R S) holds if P is a silting complex.

2.4. Torsion classes of abelian categories. In this subsection, we introduce an operation on torsion classes of abelian categories (Proposition-Definition 2.27), which plays an important role in this paper, and observe its behavior on torsion classes generated by silting modules.
Definition 2.25. Let A be an abelian category and C a subcategory of A.
(1) A pair (T , F) of subcategories of A is called a torsion pair of A if HomA(T, F ) = 0 for any T  T and F  F, and there exists a short exact sequence 0  T  X  F  0 with T  T and F  F for any X  A.
(2) We say that C is a torsion class (respectively, torsionfree class) of A if C is closed under factor objects (respectively, subobjects) and extensions.
(3) We say that C is a Serre subcategory of A if it is closed under factor objects, subobjects and extensions in A.
We denote by tors A (respectively, torf A, serre A) the set of all torsion classes (respectively, torsionfree classes, Serre subcategories) of A.
The sets tors A, torf A and serre A are posets by inclusion, that is, T  U if T  U . For a Noetherian R-algebra , let tors  := tors(mod ), torf  := torf(mod ) and serre  := serre(mod ) for simplicity.
An object X of an abelian category is called a Noetherian object (respectively, Artinian object) if each ascending (respectively, descending) chain of subobjects of X is stationary. A Noetherian (respectively, Artinian) abelian category is an abelian category such that every object is a Noetherian (respectively, Artinian) object. For example, mod  is a Noetherian abelian category, and fl  is both of Noetherian and Artinian abelian category for a Noetherian R-algebra .
Proposition 2.26. Let A be a Noetherian (respectively, Artinian) abelian category and C a subcategory of A. Then C is a torsion class (respectively, torsionfree class) of A if and only if (C, C) is a torsion pair (respectively, (C, C) is a torsionfree class) of A.
Proof. The "if" part is clear. Conversely, assume that C is a torsion class of a Noetherian abelian category A. For any X  A, if the set S = {Y | Y is a subobjects of X, Y  C} is empty, then X belongs to C. If S is non-empty, because X is a Noetherian object, S has a maximal element T by inclusion. By the maximality, X/T belongs to C. Namely, (C, C) is a torsion pair. By the similar argument, we can show the assertion in the case where A is an Artinian abelian category.
We give the following closure operation to obtain a torsion class.
Proposition-Definition 2.27. Let A be an abelian category, S a subcategory of A which is closed under subobjects and factor objects in A. For C  tors S such that C = S (CS ), we have
C := {X  A | gen X  S  C} =  CS ,

where perpendicular categories are taken in A. We have C  S = C. Moreover, this category C is the maximum among torsion classes T of A satisfying T  S  C.
Proof. We first show that C is a torsion class of A. It is clear that C is closed under factors. Let 0  X  Y  Z  0 be an exact sequence in A with X, Z  C. We show that each factor Y /Y  belongs to C if it belongs to S. We have a short exact sequence 0  (X + Y )/Y   Y /Y   Y /(X + Y )  0. Since the first term belongs to gen X  S and the third therm belongs to gen Z  S, the middle term belongs to C. It is clear that C admits the maximum property as desired.
We show the equality C =  CS . By assumption, S   CS = C holds. By the maximum property, we have C   CS . Let X  C, Y  C  S and f : X  Y . We have Im(f )  gen X  S  C. So the inclusion map Im(f )  Y is zero, and f = 0. This implies that X   CS . We complete the proof.

From now on, let R be a commutative Noetherian ring and  a Noetherian R-algebra. For a silting module M , since Ext1(M, gen M ) = 0, gen M is a torsion class of mod .
Definition 2.28. We say that a torsion class of mod  is a silting torsion class if it is of the form gen M for some silting -module M . We denote by s-tors  the set of all silting torsion class of mod  and let s-tors(fl ) := {T  fl  | T  s-tors }.
We denote by f-tors  the set of all functorially finite torsion classes of mod . Then it is easy to see that s-tors   f-tors  holds. If R is complete local, then the equality holds [Ki, Theorem 3.8].
For a torsion class T of mod , a -module T in T is said to be Ext-projective if Ext1(T, N ) = 0 for any N  T . We denote by proj T the subcategory of T consisting of Ext-projective objects of T .
Proposition 2.29. We have bijections
2-silt  - silt  - s-tors  given by P  H0(P ) and M  gen M for P  2-silt , M  silt .
Proof. The first bijection was shown in Proposition 2.3. Clearly, the second map is surjective. For a silting module M , [AMV, Lemma 3.3] says that add M =
proj(gen M ) holds. In particular, M  gen M is injective.
For a torsion class U  s-tors(fl ), we can describe U explicitly.
Theorem 2.30. For any T  s-tors , T = T  fl  holds.
We need the following concept to prove Theorem 2.30. Assume that (R, m) is a local ring. Let M, N  mod . A lifting number of the pair (M, N ) is an integer e such that for any i > 0 and any f  Hom(M/me+iM, N/me+iN ), there exists g  Hom(M, N ) such that f and g induce the same morphism from M/miM to N/miN .
Lemma 2.31. Let (R, m) be a commutative local Noetherian ring and  a Noetherian R-algebra. (a) For any M, N  mod , a lifting number of (M, N ) exists. (b) If e is a lifting number of (M, N ), then any integer e > e is also a lifting number of (M, N ).
Proof. See [Gu], and (b) directly follows from the definition.
We are ready to prove the theorem.
Proof of Theorem 2.30. Let T = gen M for M  silt . Clearly T  T  fl  holds. We first prove the assertion in the case where (R, m) is a local ring. Let X  T  fl . There exists a surjective morphism f : M0  X/mX with M0 in add M . We show that for any i > 0, there exists a surjective morphism M0  X/miX. Take a short exact sequence
0  mX/miX  X/miX - X/mX  0. We have mX/miX  gen X  fl   T  fl . Since M is a Ext-projective module in T , there exists a morphism g : M0  X/miX with g = f . This implies Im(g) + m(X/miX) = X/miX. By Nakayama's lemma, g is surjective.
Let e be a lifting number of (M0, X). By the above argument, there exists a surjective morphism  : M0  X/me+1X. Since e is a lifting number, there exists a morphism  : M0  X such that  and  induce the same morphism  =  : M0/mM0  X/mX. This means that Im() + mX = X. By Nakayama's lemma,  is surjective. Therefore X belongs to T and we have T  fl   T .
We go back to the case where R is not necessary local. Let X  T  fl . So gen X  fl   gen M holds. For each maximal ideal m of R, it is easy to see that gen Xm  fl m  gen Mm holds. Since Mm is a silting m-module, we have Xm  gen Mm by the above argument. Since T = gen M is a torsion class

of mod , there is a short exact sequence 0  T  X  F  0 with T  T and F  T . By (2.2), we
have Homm(Mm, Fm) = 0. Thus by applying the functor (-)m to the short exact sequence, a morphism Xm  Fm is zero. We have Fm = 0 for each maximal ideal m of R. Therefore F = 0 and X = T  T .

For a full subcategory C of fl , we denote by Tfl (C) the smallest torsion class of fl  containing C. The following proposition gives a connection between torsion classes of fl  and torsion classes of a finite
dimensional algebra over a field.

Proposition 2.32. Assume that R is a local ring with a unique maximal ideal m. Then the following two horizontal maps are isomorphisms of posets. Two vertical maps are anti-isomorphisms of posets, and the diagram is commutative:

tors(fl )

(-)mod(/m) 

tors(/m)

(-)
torf(fl )

(-)mod(/m) 

(-)
torf (/m)

Proof. By [Ki, Theorem 5.4], the upper horizontal map is an isomorphism of posets with an inverse map
C  Tfl (C). Clearly, both of vertical maps are anti-isomorphisms of posets. By Proposition-Definition 2.27, the diagram is commutative.

2.5. Silting for finite dimensional algebras. In this subsection, we observe and recall some properties of support  -tilting modules over finite dimensional algebras.
We denote by f-tors  the set of all functorially finite torsion classes of mod . If R is an Artinian ring, then it is known that a torsion class T of mod  is functorially finite if and only if there is a -module M such that gen M = T .
We refer the following theorem.
Theorem 2.33. [DIJ] Assume that  is a Noetherian R-algebra, where R is an Artinian ring. Then following statements are equivalent.
(i) The set silt  = s -tilt is finite. (ii) The set tors  is finite. (iii) The set f-tors  is finite. (iv) An equality tors  = f-tors  holds.
In the case where R is artinian, an algebra  is said to be  -tilting finite if it satisfies the statements of Theorem 2.33. It is natural to consider a Noetherian R-algebra such that tors(fl ) = s-tors(fl ) holds. We study such algebras in Section 4.
Let k be a field, K a field extension of k and A a finite dimensional k-algebra. For an A-module M , let MK = K k M . We have a finite dimensional K-algebra AK = K k A.
For a complex X of A-modules, we have a complex XK of AK -modules by applying the tensor functor K k (-). For two complexes P, Q in K(A) = Kb(proj A), we have HomK(AK )(PK , QK ) = K k HomK(A)(P, Q). Thus K k (-) induces a map from the set of presilting complexes over A to the set of presilting complexes over AK . Moreover this map restricts to silting complexes. We denote by K0(proj A) the Grothendieck group of proj A. For a 2-term complex P = (P-1  P0) in K(A), we call g(P ) = [P0] - [P-1]  K0(proj A) a g-vector of P .
Proposition 2.34. Under the above setting, assume that K k (-) : proj A  proj AK preserves indecomposability. If A is  -tilting finite, then K k (-) induces a bijection between 2-term presilting complexes over A and AK. Moreover this bijection restricts to 2-term silting complexes.

Proof. For an indecomposable decomposition A =

 i=1

Pi

of

A

as

a

left

module,

AK

=

i=1(Pi)K

is an indecomposable decomposition of AK by assumption. Thus K k (-) induces a surjective map

K0(proj A)  K0(proj AK). By Noether-Deuring Theorem [L, (19.25)], this map is bijective.

We denote by 2-psilt A the set of isomorphic classes of all (not necessarily basic) presilting complexes of

A. By [DIJ, Theorem 6.5], a map gA, which takes a g-vector, is an injection from 2-psilt A to K0(proj A).

If A is  -tilting finite, then this map is surjective by [DIJ], [As2, Proposition 4.8]. We have the following

commutative diagram.

2-psilt A

g(-)

K0(proj A)

K k (-) 2-psilt AK

g(-)

K k (-) K0(proj AK)

By the assumption, the right vertical map is a bijection. Since the top horizontal map is bijective and the bottom one is injective, the left vertical map is bijective. Clearly, it induces a bijection between 2-term silting complexes.

The following gives a sufficient condition for A to satisfy an assumption of Proposition 2.34.

Lemma 2.35. Let k be a field, K a field extension of k and A a finite dimensional k-algebra. For an
indecomposable projective A-module P with the top S, assume that SK is a simple AK-module. Then PK is an indecomposable AK -module.

Proof. Clearly, PK is a projective AK -module. It is easy to show that (rad A)K = rad AK holds. Then by applying the functor K k (-) to a short exact sequence 0  rad P  P  P/ rad P  0, we have that PK has a simple top. Thus PK is an indecomposable projective AK -module.

3. Classification of subcategories Throughout this section, let R be a commutative Noetherian ring and  a Noetherian R-algebra.

3.1. Torsionfree classes. For a subcategory C of mod  and a prime ideal p of R, we denote by Cp a subcategory of mod p defined as follows:
Cp := {Mp  mod p | M  C}.
The following lemmas are easy observations.
Lemma 3.1. Let p be a prime ideal of R. If (T , F) is a torsion pair of mod , then (Tp, Fp) is a torsion pair of mod p.
Proof. By (2.2), Homp(Tp, Fp) = 0 holds for any T  T and F  F. For any -module X, a short exact sequence 0  T  X  F  0 with T  T and F  F induces a short exact sequence 0  Tp  Xp  Fp  0. This implies, together with Lemma 2.13, (Tp, Fp) is a torsion pair of mod p.
We also have the following properties.
Lemma 3.2. Let C be a subcategory of mod  and p a prime ideal of R. (a) If C is closed under extensions in mod , then Cp is closed under extensions in mod p. (b) If C is closed under factor modules (respectively, submodules) in mod , then Cp is closed under factor modules (respectively, submodules) in mod p. (c) If C is a torsion class (respectively, torsionfree class, Serre subcategory) of mod , then Cp is a torsion class (respectively, torsionfree class, Serre subcategory) of mod p.

Proof. (a) Let 0  Xp  E  Zp  0 be a short exact sequence in mod p with X, Z  C and denote this by g  Ext1p(Zp, Xp). By the isomorphism (2.2), there exist f  Ext1(Z, X) and r  R \ p such that fp = rg. This implies that the multiplication map (톜) of r induces an isomorphism between the middle term of fp and E. Since the middle therm of f belongs to C, E belongs to Cp.
(b) Assume that C is closed under factor modules in mod . By (2.2) and Lemma 2.13, any surjective
morphism form an object in Cp to an object in mod p is of the form fp : Xp  Yp with X  C, Y  mod  and f  Hom(X, Y ). Since Im(fp) = (Im f )p  Cp, Yp belongs to Cp. Similarly, we can show the property about submodules.
(c) This directly follows from (a) and (b).

Let TR() and FR() be the Cartesian products of tors(fl p) and torf(fl p) respectively, where p runs all prime ideals of R:

TR() :=

tors(fl p),

pSpec R

FR() :=

torf(fl p).

pSpec R

The set TR() and FR() are posets by inclusion, that is, {X p}p  {Yp}p if X p  Yp for any p. By Lemma 3.2, the following maps are well-defined:

 : tors  - TR(),  : torf  - FR(),

T  {Tp  fl p}p, F  {Fp  fl p}p.

It is easy to see that these maps are morphisms of posets. We first see that  and  commute with taking perpendicular categories. Since fl p is both of a
Noetherian and an Artinian abelian category, there is a bijection from tors(fl p) to torf(fl p) given by (-) = (-)fl p , where the inverse map is given by (-) = fl p (-). Thus we have a bijection between TR() and FR() indued from (-), we also denote it by (-):

(-) : TR() - FR(),

(3.1)

where the inverse map is induced from (-). It is easy to see that this map is an anti-isomorphism of posets. We have the following commutativity of maps.

Lemma 3.3. We have the following commutative diagram

tors   TR()

(-)
torf  

(-)
FR(),

where the right vertical map is an anti-isomorphism of posets and the left vertical map is injective.

Proof. For T  tors  and p  Spec R, we have
(Tp  fl p)fl p = (Tp)mod p  fl p = (T mod  )p  fl p
where the first equality holds since T is a torsion class, and the second one comes from Lemma 3.1. This implies that the diagram is commutative. By Proposition 2.26, (-)  (-) is the identity map on tors .

Our main result in this subsection is the following one.

Theorem 3.4. Let  be a Noetherian R-algebra. Then the map  : torf  - FR()
is an isomorphism of posets.

To show Theorem 3.4, we construct a map  in the opposite direction to  and show that  is n inverse map of .

Definition 3.5. Let p be a prime ideal of R. For a torsionfree class Y of fl p, let Yq := {X  mod  | Ass X  {p}, Xp  Y}.
It is easy to see that Yq is a torsionfree class of mod . So we define a map  as follows:  : FR() - torf , {Yp}p  Filt Y|p | p  Spec R .

We need the following two lemmas.

Lemma 3.6. Let p be a prime ideal of R. For a torsionfree class Y of fl p, the following statements hold.
(a) For a prime ideal q = p, (Yq)q  fl q = 0 holds. (b) (Yq)p = Y holds.
Proof. (a) Let X  Yq and assume that 0 = Xq  fl q. Since Ass X  {p}, we have Supp X  V (p) holds. Thus p  q holds. However since Xq  fl q, q is minimal in Supp X. Therefore we have p = q holds.
(b) Clearly, we have (Yq)p  Y. The converse inclusion directly follows from Lemma 2.13.
Lemma 3.7. For X, Y  mod  and a prime ideal p of R, if there is an injective morphism Xp  Yp and Ass X  {p}, then there is an injective morphism X  Y .
Proof. By the isomorphism (2.2), any morphism from Xp to Yp is of the form s-1fp for some f : X  Y and s  R \ p. Assume that fp is injective. We have Ker(f )p = 0. Since Ass(Ker(f ))  Ass X  {p}, we have Ass(Ker(f )) = . Therefore Ker(f ) = 0.

We give one description of torsionfree class.

Proposition 3.8. For a torsionfree class F of mod , we have F = Filt{X  F |  Ass X = 1}.

Proof. We claim that for X  F, there is a non-zero -submodule Y of X such that  Ass Y = 1 and
X/Y  F. Since X is a Noetherian object, this claim induces the assertion. Let p be a maximal element of Ass X. There is an exact sequence R  R  R/p  0 for some integer . By applying the functor
HomR(-, X), we have a non-zero -submodule Y = HomR(R/p, X) of X. We have Supp Y  V (p). This implies that Ass Y  Ass X  V (p) = {p}, where the last equality follows from the maximality of p.
Therefore the claim holds.

We prove Theorem 3.4.
Proof of Theorem 3.4. We first show that    is an identity map on FR(). Let Y = {Yp}p be an element of FR(). For any prime ideal q of R, we have
(Y)q  fl q = Filt Y|p | p  Spec R  fl q = (Y|q)q  fl q = Yq,
q
where the second equality follows form Lemma 3.6(a) and the third one follows form Lemma 3.6(b). Therefore    = id holds.
We show that    is an identity map on torf . Let F  torf  and F := ((F)). For each prime ideal p of R, we have Fp  fl p  F. In fact, for X  Fp  fl p, there is Y  F such that Xp  Yp. Then by Lemma 3.7, X is a -submodule of Y . We have X  F because F is a torsionfree class. In particular,

18

F  F holds. Finally we see that F  F holds. Clearly we have {X  F | Ass X  {p}}  Fp  fl p holds. This implies the following middle inclusion:
F 3=.8 Filt{X  F |  Ass X = 1}  Filt(Fp  fl p | p  Spec R) = F.
We complete the proof.

In the case where  = R, the following corollary recovers a result by Takahashi [T].

Corollary 3.9. Let  be a Noetherian R-algebra such that p is Morita equivalent to a local ring for each prime ideal p. Then the set of torsionfree classes of mod  corresponds bijectively with the set of all subsets of Spec R.
Proof. By the assumption, torf(fl p) = {0, fl p} holds for each p. For an element {Yp}p of FR(), let S({Yp}p) = {p  Spec R | Yp = 0}. Then S is a bijection from FR() to the set of subsets of Spec R. Thus the assertion comes from Theorem 3.4.

By Theorem 3.4 and Lemma 3.3, the map  : tors   TR() is injective. In the next subsection, we study this map.

3.2. Torsion classes. In this subsection we study the set tors  by using the map  : tors   TR() defined in the previous subsection. We construct a map in the opposite direction to .

Lemma 3.10. For a torsion class T of mod p, {X  mod  | Xp  T } is a torsion class of mod . Proof. The subcategory is clearly closed under extensions and factor modules in mod .

Note that for any -module X, (gen X)p = gen(Xp) holds. Therefore we write (gen X)p = gen Xp for simplicity.

Definition 3.11. Let p be a prime ideal of R. For a torsion class T of fl p, let T = {X  mod p | gen X  fl p  T }, T = {X  mod  | Xp  T } = {X  mod  | gen Xp  fl p  T }.

By Proposition-Definition 2.27 and Lemma 3.10, T (respectively, T ) is a torsion class of mod p (respectively, mod ). For an element X = {X p}p of TR() let

(X ) :=

X p = {X  mod  | For any p  Spec R, gen Xp  fl p  X p}.

pSpec R

Since X p is a torsion class of mod  for each p, (X ) is also a torsion class of mod . Thus we have a map.

 : TR() - tors , X  (X ). We have the following proposition, whose proof is independent from Theorem 3.4.

(3.2)

Proposition 3.12. The composite    is an identity map on tors .

Proof. For any T  tors , we show ((T )) = T . Clearly T  ((T )) holds. We show that any
module in ((T )) belongs to T . Let X  ((T )). Since T is a torsion class of mod , there exits
a short exact sequence 0  T  X  F  0 with T  T and Hom(T , F ) = 0. It is suffices to prove F = 0. Assume that F = 0 and take a minimal element p in Supp F . Then Fp belongs to fl p and Homp(Tp, Fp) = 0. Since X  ((T )), Fp  gen Xp  fl p  Tp holds. Thus Fp = 0, which is a contradiction.

It is easy to see that both sets tors  and TR() are complete lattices. In fact, for a family  = {T i}iI of torsion classes of mod , the meet is  = iI T i, and the join  is given by a subcategory of mod  consisting of objects having a finite filtration of submodules such that each subfactor module belongs to some T i. TR() is also a complete lattice, where meets and joins are given by term-wise.
Theorem 3.13. The following statements hold.
(a) The map  : tors   TR() is an embedding of complete join-semilattices. (b) Let X = {X p}p  TR(). X belongs to Im  if and only if X satisfies the following condition: for
any prime ideal p of R and any X  X p, there exists Y  (X ) such that Yp is isomorphic to X.
Proof. (a)  is injective by Proposition 3.12 and is a morphism of posets by construction. For a family  = {T i}iI of torsion classes of mod , and a given prime ideal p of R, we show that ( )p  fl p =
i(Tpi  fl p) holds. Clearly  holds. Let X  ( )p  fl p. There is a -module Y   with Yp  X. Then Y has a finite filtration of submodules such that each subfactor module belongs to some T i. This implies that Yp belongs to i(Tpi  fl p), since the localization functor is exact.
(b) We show that (T ) satisfies the condition for each torsion class T of mod . We have (T ) = {Tp fl p}p. By Proposition 3.12 ({Tp fl p}p) = T holds. For any prime ideal p of R and X  Tp fl p, there is a -module Y  T with Yp = X, as desired.
We show that X = ((X )) holds if X satisfies the condition. Let T = (X ). By the definition of , Tp  fl p  X p holds. Conversely, since X satisfies the condition, for any X  X p, there exists Y  T such that Yp is isomorphic to X. Namely, X p  Tp  fl p holds.
Contrary to ,  is rarely bijective. The rest of this paper is devoted to giving simple equivalent conditions such that X belongs to the image of .
As an immediate consequence of Theorem 3.13, we deduce a famous result of Gabriel [Ga], also a result by Stanley-Wang [SW]. A subset S of Spec R is said to be specialization-closed if for any two prime ideals p  q of R, q  S always implies p  S.
Corollary 3.14. Let  be a Noetherian R-algebra such that p is Morita equivalent to a local ring for each prime ideal p. Then the torsion classes of mod  bijectively corresponds with the set of specialization-closed subsets of Spec R.
Proof. For an element {X p}p of TR(), we assign the following subset of Spec R:
S({X p}p) = {p  Spec(R) | X p = 0}.
For a torsion class T of mod , S((T )) is a specialization-closed subset of Spec R. In fact, since Tp is a torsion class of mod p, Tp  fl p = 0 if and only if Tp = 0. Then for prime ideals p  q, if Tp = 0 then Tq = (Tp)q = 0. Therefore S((T )) is specialization-closed.
We show that this W restricts to a bijection from Im  to the set of specialization-closed subsets of Spec R. Since p is Morita equivalent to a local ring, tors(fl p) = {0, fl p} holds for any prime ideal p of R. This implies that W is injective on Im . Let S be a specialization-closed subset of Spec R and let {X p}p be an element of TR() such that X p = fl p if p  S and X p = 0 if else. By Lemma 2.13, this {X p}p satisfies the condition of Theorem 3.13 and satisfies W({X p}p) = S.

3.3. Serre subcategories. In this subsection, we classify Serre subcategories of mod  for an arbitrary
Noetherian R-algebra . Let SR() be the Cartesian product of serre(fl p), where p runs all prime ideals of R:

SR() :=

serre(fl p).

pSpec R

20

O. IYAMA AND Y. KIMURA

By Lemma 3.2,  restricts to a map form serre  to SR(). Moreover by Lemma 3.15 below,  restricts to an inverse direction map. The composite    is an identity map on serre  by Proposition 3.12:
serre  - SR() - serre .

Lemma 3.15. For any element X of SR(), (X ) is a Serre subcategory of mod .

Proof. Let X = {X p}p and S = (X ). It is enough to show that S is closed under submodules. Let X  S and Y be a submodule of X and p a prime ideal of R. It is suffice to prove that Yp/pnYp belongs to X p for a large integer n > 0. By the Artin-Rees lemma, there is a positive integer k such that for any
integer n with n  k, pnXp  Yp = pn-k(pkXp  Yp) holds. Then for any integer n with n  k, we have

Xp pn+k Xp



Yp + pn+kXp pn+k Xp



Yp pn+k Xp

 Yp

=

Yp pn (pk Xp

 Yp) .

Since there exists a surjective morphism from the right term to Yp/pnYp, and Xp/pn+kXp belongs to X p, Yp/pnYp belongs to X p.

We give an easy observation such that an algebra  with the property tors  = serre .

Proposition 3.16. The following statements are equivalent.
(i) tors  = serre  holds. (ii) For any prime ideal p of R, p is Morita equivalent to a finite direct product of local rings.

Proof. The statement (ii) holds if and only if tors p = serre p holds for any prime ideal p of R. By
Theorem 3.13 and Lemma 3.15, (ii) implies (i). Assume that (i) holds. Fix a prime ideal q of R and fix a torsion class X q of fl q. Consider an element X = {X p}p of TR() such that X p = fl p if p properly contains q, X p = 0 if p does not belong to V (q). Then this X is a compatible element by Lemma 2.13. Since tors  = serre , X q is a Serre subcategory of fl q. So (ii) holds.

For a prime ideal p of R, we denote by sim p the set of all isomorphism classes of simple p-modules. Then sim p = sim(fl p) holds, since any simple p-module S satisfies pS = 0 by Nakayama's lemma. It is easy to see that there is a bijection between the set P(sim p) of all subsets of sim p and serre(fl p):

serre(fl p) - P(sim p), C  C  sim p,

(3.3)

where the inverse map is given by S  Filt S for a subset S of sim p. Let Sim be the disjoint union of sim p:

Sim :=

sim p.

pSpec R

By using (3.3), we identify SR() = P(Sim), and we regard that  is a map from serre  to P(Sim).

 : serre  - SR() = P(Sim),

C

(Cp  sim p).

pSpec R

We introduce a partial oder on Sim as follows. Note that for prime ideals p  q there is a natural morphism p  q. By this morphism, each q-module can be regarded as a p-module.

Definition 3.17. We define a partial order on Sim as follows.
(1) For given S, T  Sim, we write S  T if there exist prime ideals p  q of R such that S  sim p, T  sim q and S is a subfactor p-module of T .
(2) A subset S of Sim is called a down-set if S  T and T  S always implies S  S.

By using down-sets, we classify Serre subcategories.

CLASSIFYING TORSION PAIRS OF NOETHERIAN ALGEBRAS

Theorem 3.18. The injective map

 : serre  - P(Sim), C 

(Cp  sim p)

pSpec R

induces an isomorphism between serre  and the set of all down-sets of Sim.

To prove Theorem 3.18, we need the following observation.

Lemma 3.19. Let  be a Noetherian R-algebra, X  mod , S a simple -module, and q a prime ideal of R. If S is a subfactor of Xq, then S is a subfactor of X. The converse holds if a natural morphism X  Xq is injective.
Proof. Assume that S is a subfactor of Xq. Then there are -submodules Z  Y of X such that (Y /Z)q is isomorphic to S as -modules. So there is a non-zero -morphism from Y to S, which is surjective since S is simple. Therefore S is a subfactor -module of X. The last assertion is clear.

We prove the theorem.

Proof of Theorem 3.18. Let C  serre . We first show that (C) is a down-set of Sim. Let S  T with
S  sim p and T  sim q for prime ideals p  q of R. Assume that T  (C) and take X  C such that Xq  T . By Lemma 3.19, any simple subfactor p-module of Xq is a subfactor module of Xp. In particular, S is a subfactor of Xp. Since Xp belongs to the Serre subcategory Cp, S also belongs to Cp.
Let S be a down-set of Sim. Let C be a full subcategory of mod  consisting of modules X such that
for each prime ideal p of R, all composition factor of the p-module Xp belong to S. Clearly C is a Serre subcategory of mod . We show (C) = S holds. Clearly we have (C)  S. Fix a prime ideal q of R.
Let S  sim(fl q)  S and X  mod  such that Xq  S and Supp X  V (q). Let Y be the image of X  Xq. Then Yq = X  S holds. We show that Y belongs to C. For p  q, we have Yp = 0, since Supp Y  Supp X  V (q) holds. For p  q, since Yp  Yq  S is injective, any subfactor p-module of Yp is a subfactor module of S. Since S is a down-set, Y belongs to C. Therefore S belongs to (C) as desired.

Example 3.20. Let k be a field and R = k[[x]] with a unique maximal ideal m = (x) and let

=

f,

ab cd

R

RR mR

f -am .

This  is a Noetherian R-algebra. Let K = R0 = k((x)) be a fractional field of R. We have 0 = K  M2(K), where M2(K) is the K-algebra of (2  2)-matrices over K. Then there are two simple 0-modules

T1 = K  0,

T2 = 0 

K K

.

Moreover, /m has two simple modules S1 and S2 associated with the idempotens e1 = (1R, E1) and e2 = (0, E2) of , respectively, where Ei is the matrix unit whose (i, i) entry is 1R. Then we have the following Hasse diagram of the poset (Sim, ), where for two elements a, b, we write a  b if a > b and
there are no intermediate element between a and b.

Thus (Sim, ) has 8 down-sets. So there are 8 Serre subcategories of mod , and the Hasse diagram of serre  is as follows, where the vertices are presented by dwon-sets of Sim.

3.4. Compatible elements. We introduce a condition which is weaker than the condition in Theorem 3.13 and study it when the Krull dimension of R is one. For a prime ideal p of R and a torsion class T of fl p, recall that

T = {X  mod p | gen X  fl p  T },

which is a torsion class of mod p by Proposition-Definition 2.27. For two prime ideals p  q of R, we define a map

rp, q : tors(fl p) - tors(fl q), T  T q  fl q.
For any p, the map rp, p is an identity map by Lemma 2.27. We consider the following condition.

(3.4)

Definition 3.21. We call an element {X p}p of TR() a compatible element if rp, q(X p)  X q holds for any pair p  q of prime ideals of R.

We give an easy observation.

Proposition 3.22. Any element in Im  is compatible.

Proof. Let X = {X p}p  Im . Fix prime ideals p  q and X  X q. By Theorem 3.13, there is a -module Y in (X ) such that Yq  X. Since Y is in (X ), we have gen Yp  fl p  X p. Thus Yp belongs to X p. We have (Yp)q = Yq  X, and this implies rp, q(X p)  X q.
The following is an easy lemma about rp,q, which will be used in Subsection 4.2.
Lemma 3.23. For prime ideals p  q  r of R and a torsion class T  tors(fl p), we have rq,r  rp,q(T )  rp,r(T ). If T  s-tors(fl p), then the equality holds.

Proof. Let X = (T )q  tors q. By Proposition-Definition 2.27, we have X  X  fl q = rp,q(T ). Therefore we have rp,r(T ) = Xr  fl r  rp,q(T )  fl r = rq,r  rp,q(T ) as desired. The last assertion
r
easily follows from Theorem 2.30.

Under some conditions, the inverse of Proposition 3.22 holds. The following is the first example.

Example 3.24. If R is a local ring with Krull dimension one, then any compatible element is in Im .

Proof. Let X = {X p}p be a compatible element of TR(). It is enough to show that for any height zero prime ideal p and any X  X p, there is a -module Y  (X ) such that Yp  X. Let m be a unique maximal ideal of R. Since X is compatible, rm, p(X m)  X p holds. Thus there is a -module M
in X m such that Mp  X. Since X has finite length as p-module, there is positive integer  such that

CLASSIFYING TORSION PAIRS OF NOETHERIAN ALGEBRAS

23

(M/pM )p  X. This M/pM belongs to X m and Supp(M/pM ) = {p, m} holds. In particular M/pM belongs to (X ) and we have the assertion.

In the rest of this subsection, we study compatible elements when R is a semi-local ring with the Krull dimension one.
Recall that a subset I of Spec R is a down-set if p  q and p  I always implies q  I. We need the following technical lemma.

Lemma 3.25. Let {X q}q be a compatible element. Let I be a down-set of Spec R and p a minimal element
in Spec R \ I. Then for a -module X  qI X q, there is a -module Y such that Y  qI{p} X q and Yq = Xq for any q  I.

Proof. Since X p is a torsion class of mod , there exists a short exact sequence 0  Y  X -f Z  0 in mod  such that Y  X p and Z  X p. We divide the proof into three steps.

(i) We show that each associated prime ideal q of the R-module Z satisfies q  p. There is x  Z such

that Rx is isomorphic to R/q. Assume that q  p. Since there is a surjection from a finite product of

Rx to x, and (Rx)p  (R/q)p = 0 holds, we have (x)p = 0. Therefore x belongs to X p. However Hom(x, Z) = 0 holds, which is a contradiction. We have q  p.
(ii) We show that Supp Z  V (p) holds. It suffices to show that each minimal element q in Supp Z

satisfies q = p. By (i) q  p holds. If q = p, then q  I holds since p is a minimal element of Spec R \ I.

Consequently, we have Xq  X q  fl q = X q. On the other hand (X p)q = ((X p)p)q = (X p)q  X q holds.

So we have

Zq 


Xp

3.=2(d)

q



Xp

 (X q) .

q

Since there is a surjective morphism fq : Xq  Zq, Zq = 0 holds, a contradiction. Therefore p = q holds as desired.

(iii) Since I is a down-set, I  V (p) = 0 holds. In particular we have Xq = Yq for any q  I.

We say that a subset I of Spec R is cofinite is Spec R \ I is a finite set.

Proposition 3.26. Let X = {X p} be a compatible element of TR(). Let I be a cofinite down-set of Spec R. Then for a -module X  qI X q, there is a -submodule Y of X such that Y  (X ) and Yp = Xp for any p  I.
Proof. Since I is cofinite, we can apply Lemma 3.25 inductively and have the assertion.

Then we give the main theorem of this subsection.

Theorem 3.27. Let X = {X p} be a compatible element of TR(). Assume that there is a torsion class T of mod  and a cofinite down-set I of Spec R such that
(i) X p  Tp  fl p holds for any p  Spec R, and (ii) X p = Tp  fl p holds for any p  I.
Then X belongs to the image of  : tors   TR().
Proof. We show that ((X )) = X holds, that is, (X )p  fl p = X p holds for any p  Spec R. By the definition of , (X )p  fl p  X p always holds. We show that X p  (X )p for any p  Spec R.
Fix one p  Spec R. By the assumption (i), any object in X p is of the form Tp for some T  T such that Supp T  V (p) by Lemma 2.13. For any q  I, we have Tq  Tq  fl q = X q. Thus for any q  I := I  {p}  V (p)c, we have Tq  X q. Namely, T belongs to qI X q. By Proposition 3.26 for a cofinite down-set I, there is a -submodule Y of T such that Y  (X ) and Yq = Tq for any q  I. In particular, Tp = Yp  (X )p holds.

24

O. IYAMA AND Y. KIMURA

Corollary 3.28. Let R be a semi-local ring with the Krull dimension one and  be a Noetherian Ralgebra. Then the map  : tors   TR() induces an isomorphism of posets between tors  and the set of compatible elements of TR().
Proof. Since Spec R is a finite set, we can apply Theorem 3.27 for T = mod .

In the case where (R, m) is a local domain, in [Ki, Theomrem 5.9], it was shown that there is a bijection
tors   T tors(fl )[0, rm,0(T )]tors 0 , where [0, rm,0(T )]tors 0 is an interval in tors 0. Clearly, this disjoint union bijectively corresponds to the set of compatible elements of TR(). Thus Corollary 3.28 recovers this bijection.

Example 3.29. Consider the algebra  in Example 3.20. We use notation in the example. Then tors(fl ) and tors 0 have the following Hasse diagrams.

fl

tors(fl ) = gen(e1)  fl  add S1

gen(e2)  fl  , add S2

mod 0

tors 0 = add T1

add T2 .

We can calculate that rm, 0(gen(e1)  fl ) = mod 0, rm, 0(gen(e2)  fl ) = add T2, rm, 0(add S1) = add T1 and rm, 0(add S2) = 0 by Theorem 2.30. Therefore TR() has 14 compatible elements and the Hasse diagram of tors  is as follows, where for a given torsion class T of mod , the corresponding compatible
element (T ) is represented by a pair {M, N } of a silting -module M and a silting 0-module N . Namely (T ) = {gen M  fl , gen N  fl 0} holds.

4. Silting theory and compatible elements
In this section we study compatible elements in the case where the number of torsion classes of fl p is finite for each p. Throughout this section, let R be a commutative Noetherian ring and let  be a Noetherian R-algebra.
4.1. Silting finiteness. Throughout this subsection, assume that R is a local ring with a unique maximal ideal m.
We use the following lemma.
Lemma 4.1. The following statements hold.

CLASSIFYING TORSION PAIRS OF NOETHERIAN ALGEBRAS

25

(a) For -module P  proj , End(P ) is local if and only if End(P/mP ) is local. (b) If  is semi-perfect, then the functor (R/m) R (-) : proj   proj(/m) is full and dense.
Proof. (a) There exists a surjective morphism  : End(Pi)  End(Pi/mPi). By [Ki, Lemma 4.1], the kernel of  is contained in m End(Pi). Since End(Pi) is a Noetherian R-algebra, m End(Pi)  rad End(Pi) holds. Therefore we have the assertion.
(b) The functor is dense since proj  is Krull-Schmidt. Clearly, the functor is full.
For a two-term complex P = (P1  P0) in Kb(proj ), let (R/m) R P := (P1/mP1  P0/mP0)  Kb(proj(/m)). Then we have the following commutative diagram:

2-silt 

(R/m) R (-)

2-silt(/m)

H 0 (-) silt 

(R/m) R (-)

H 0 (-) silt(/m)

(4.1)

gen(-) s-tors 

(-)  mod(/m)

gen(-) f-tors(/m),

where vertical maps are bijections by Proposition 2.29.

Proposition 4.2. The three horizontal maps in (4.1) are injective. Moreover if  is a semi-perfect ring, then they are bijective.

Proof. Because of the commutative diagram (4.1), we only consider the bottom map (-)  mod(/m). We first show that the bottom map is injective. Let M, N  silt  and assume that gen M  mod(/m) = gen N  mod(/m) holds. By Proposition 2.32, we have gen M  fl  = gen N  fl . Then we have

gen M = gen M  fl  = gen N  fl  = gen N,

where we use Theorem 2.30 for the first and the last equalities.
We show that the bottom map (-)  mod(/m) is surjective if  is a semi-perfect ring. By [AIR], any functorially finite torsion class in mod(/m) is of the form gen(H0(P )) for some P   2-silt(/m). Let P  = (P1  P0). By Lemma 4.1 (b), there exists a 2-term complex P = (P1  P0) in Kb(proj ) such that (R/m) R P = P . Let M := H0(P ). Then we have M/mM  H0(P ). By [Ki, Proposition 4.2 (a)], P is a 2-term presilting complex in Kb(proj ). Let g be a left (add P )-approximation of  in Kb(proj ). Then P  Cone(g) is a 2-term silting complex by [Ai, Proposition 2.16]. Let N := H0(Cone(g)), which belongs to gen M . We have gen(M  N )  mod(/m) = gen M  mod(/m) = gen(H0(P )).

The main theorem of this subsection is the following one. Recall that s-tors  = {gen M | M  silt } and s-tors(fl ) = {gen M  fl  | M  silt }.

Theorem 4.3. Let R be a commutative local Noetherian ring and  a Noetherian R-algebra. We consider the following statements.
(i) s-tors(fl ) = tors(fl ) holds. (ii) s-tors  = {T  tors  | T  fl  = T } holds. (iii) The set tors(fl ) of torsion classes of fl  is finite. (iv) The set silt  of additively equivalence classes of silting -modules is finite.

26

O. IYAMA AND Y. KIMURA

Then we have the following implications: (i)  (ii)  (iii)  (iv). Moreover if  is semi-perfect, then all statements are equivalent.

Proof. We show that (i) implies (ii). By Theorem 2.30, gen M  fl  = gen M holds for any M  silt . Let T be a torsion class of mod  such that T  fl  = T . By (i), there exists M  silt  such that gen M  fl  = T  fl . Then we have

gen M = gen M  fl  = T  fl  = T .

Therefore (ii) holds. Conversely, we show that (ii) implies (i). Let U  tors(fl ). In general, we have
U  fl  = U . So there exists M  silt  such that gen M = U by (ii). We have gen M  fl  = U  fl  = U . We show that (i) implies (iii). By Proposition 2.32, (i) implies that all torsion classes of mod(/m)
are functorially finite. Thus by Theorem 2.33, tors(/m) = f-tors(/m) holds and this is a finite set. By Proposition 4.2, {gen M | M  silt } is a finite set. So tors(fl ) is a finite set.
The statement (iii) implies (iv), since a map M  gen M  fl  is injective from silt  to tors(fl ) by Proposition 2.29 and Theorem 2.30.
Assume that  is semi-perfect and (iv) holds. By Theorem 2.33 and Proposition 4.2, all torsion classes of mod(/m) are functorially finite. Let T  tors(fl ). Again by Proposition 4.2, there is a silting -module M such that gen M  mod(/m) = gen(M/mM ) = T  mod(/m) holds. By Propositions 2.32, gen M  fl  = T holds.

Proposition 4.4. Assume that R is ring indecomposable and  is a faithful R-module. If tors(fl ) = s-tors(fl ) holds, then R is a local ring.

Proof. Let m be a maximal ideal of R. Since fl m is a torsion class of fl , there is a silting -module M such that gen M  fl  = fl m. We have gen Mm = gen Mm  fl m = fl m = mod m by Theorem 2.30. In particular, Mm is a progenerator of mod m and Supp M  SuppRm(m) holds. For a maximal ideal n = m, we have gen Mn = gen Mn  fl n = 0 = 0. This implies that Mn = 0.

We see that Supp M = Spec Rm holds. Since m is a faithful Rm-module, SuppRm(m) = Spec Rm holds. If p  Supp M \ Spec Rm exists, let n be a maximal ideal of R which contains p. Then n = m holds,

since p  Spec Rm. However n  Supp M holds, which is a contradiction. Thus we have the equality.

We show that Supp M is a connected component of Spec R. Let {p1, . . . , p, q1, . . . , qn} be the set of all

minimal prime ideals of R such that pi  Supp M and qj  Supp M . We have C :=

since Supp M is a closed subset of Spec R. On the other hand, since Spec R \ Supp M = Spec R \ Spec Rm

Since C  C = Spec R,

C = Supp M and C = Spec R \ Supp M hold. Therefore Supp M is closed and open in Spec R.

Since R is ring indecomposable, Spec R is connected, see [E, Exercise 2.25] for instance. Thus Spec R =

Supp M = Spec Rm and so R is a local ring.

4.2. Compatible elements for silting finite case. We use the following observation.
Lemma 4.5. Assume that (R, m) is a local ring. For a -module X, we have T(X)  fl  = Tfl (X/mX).
Proof. Clearly, T(X)  fl   Tfl (X/mX) holds. Let Z be a module in T(X)  fl . Then Z has a finite filtration such that each subfactor belongs to gen X  fl . Let Y  gen X  fl . There is a positive integer  such that mY = 0. Then Y has a finite filtration 0 = mY  m-1Y      mY  Y . Since Y  gen X, each miY /mi+1Y belongs to gen(X/mX). Therefore Y and Z belong to Tfl (X/mX).
A morphism f : X  Y of posets is called an embedding if f is injective and a partial order on X coincides with the restriction of a partial order on Y . Then f is embedding if and only if f (a)  f (b) implies a  b for any a, b  X.

Proposition 4.6. Let {X p}p be a compatible element of TR(). Assume that for each prime ideal p of R, there is a silting -module T p such that gen(T p)p  fl p = X p and rp,q is an embedding for any pair q  p of prime ideals of R. Then {X p}p belongs to the image of  : tors   TR().
Proof. Because {X p}p is compatible, for any pair q  p of prime ideals, we have
X q  rp, q(X p) = (X p)q  fl q = gen(T p)q  fl q,
where we use Theorem 2.30 for the last equality. Since X q = gen(T q)q  fl q, we have gen(T q)q  fl q  gen(T p)q  fl q.
Let T := ({X p}p). We show that X q  Tq holds for any prime ideal q. First we show that T q/qT q belongs to T . Let p be a prime ideal. If p does not contain q, then (T q/qT q)p = 0. So assume that q  p. Then we have
gen(T q/qT q)p  fl p  gen(T q)p  fl p  gen(T p)p  fl p = X p, where there second inclusion occurs since rp,q is an embedding. This implies that T q/qT q belongs to T . Finally, we have
X q = gen(T q)q  fl q = Tfl q ((T q/qT q)q)  Tq,
where we use Lemma 4.5 for the second equality. We complete the proof.

It is easy to see that the localization functor (-)p induces a map from silt  to silt p for each prime ideal p of R. For two posets X, Y , we denote by Homposet(X, Y ) the set of all poset morphisms from X to Y . This set of morphisms is a partially ordered set: for two morphisms f, g : X  Y , we write f  g if f (x)  g(x) holds for any x  X.
We show the main theorem of this subsection.

Theorem 4.7. Assume that (R, m) is a local ring, tors(fl ) = s-tors(fl ) holds and rm, p is an isomorphism for any prime ideal p of R. Then any compatible element of TR() belongs to Im . In particular, we have an isomorphism of posets:
tors   Homposet(Spec R, tors(fl )).
Proof. By the assumption, tors(fl ) = s-tors(fl ) = {gen M  fl  | M  silt } holds. Let {X p}p be a compatible element of TR(). For each prime ideal p of R, since rm, p is surjective, there exists a silting -module T p such that gen(T p)p  fl p = X p holds. Since rp,q is an isomorphism, it is an embedding. Therefore by applying Proposition 4.6, we have the first assertion.
By Proposition 3.22, tors  is isomorphic to the set of compatible elements of TR(). We show that the set of compatible elements is isomorphic to Homposet(Spec R, tors(fl )) as posets. For a given compatible element {X p}p, let f : Spec R  tors(fl ) be a map defined by f (p) := r-m,1p(X p). Since rm, q = rp,q  rm, p holds for prime ideals q  p  m of R by Lemma 3.23, this f is a morphism of posets. Conversely, for given morphism f from Spec R to tors(fl ), we have an element {rm, p(f (p))}p of TR(). Again by rm, q = rp,q  rm, p, this {rm, p(f (p))}p is a compatible element. Clearly these morphisms are mutually inverse.

We give one example. By Theorem 2.30, the following diagram commutes:

2-silt

2-silt p

O. IYAMA AND Y. KIMURA

Let A be a finite dimensional algebra over a field k. A simple A-module S is said to be k-simple if for any field extension K of k, SK = K k S is a simple AK-module. For instance, if k is an algebraically closed field, or A is a factor algebra of a finite quiver module an admissible ideal, then all simple A-modules are k-simple.
Example 4.8. Let k be a field and let A be a finite dimensional k-algebra. Assume that A is  -tilting finite and any simple A-module is k-simple. Then for arbitrary commutative local Noetherian k-algebra (R, m), we have
tors(R k A)  Homposet(Spec R, tors A).
Proof. Let  = R k A. We first show that p = Rp k A is a semi-perfect ring for each prime ideal p of R. Let A = i=1Pi be an indecomposable decomposition of A as a left A-module and (p) = Rp/pRp. By Lemma 2.35, each (p) k Pi is indecomposable. Thus by Lemma 4.1(a), p is a semi-perfect ring.
For each prime ideal p of R, we have the following maps:
2-silt A -R--k-- 2-silt  -R-p--R-- 2-silt p --(p-)--R-p- 2-silt(p/pp).
Since p is a semi-perfect ring, the last map is bijective by Proposition4.2. By applying Proposition 2.34, the composite of these three maps is bijective. Thus the composite of the left map and the middle map is bijective. In the case where p = m, the middle map is an identity map. Therefore all three maps are bijective. Because of these bijections and the diagram (4.2), we have that rm, p is bijection for any prime ideal p of R. Since 2-silt  is a finite set, tors(fl ) = s-tors(fl ) holds by Theorem 4.3. Thus we can apply Theorem 4.7 to .

4.3. Path algebras of Dynkin quivers. Throughout this subsection, let Q be a Dynkin quiver, and R be a commutative Noetherian ring (which is not necessarily a local ring). We study torsion classes of the path algebra RQ.
Let k be a field and k an algebraically closed field of k. By Proposition 2.34, tors kQ is isomorphic to tors kQ as posets. By [IT, Theorem 4.3] and [R], tors kQ is isomorphic to the Cambrian lattice CQ of Q. Therefore, for any field k, we have an isomorphism of posets:

Fp : tors kQ - CQ.

(4.3)

The main result of this subsection is the following one.

Theorem 4.9. Let Q be a Dynkin quiver and R a commutative Noetherian ring. Then any compatible element in TR(RQ) belongs to the image of . In particular, we have an isomorphism of posets:
tors RQ  Homposet(Spec R, CQ).

Notice that a similar type of result was given in [AS] for localizing subcategories of D(Mod RQ). In the rest of this subsection, we prove Theorem 4.9. We use a famous result of representations of Q by Gabriel, see [ASS, Chapter VII. 5] for instance. For a finite-dimensional algebra A, we denote by  = A the Auslander-Reiten translation of A.

Proposition 4.10. Let Q be a Dynkin quiver and  a positive root of a quadratic form of Q. Then there exist a unique integer   0 and a unique vertex i  Q0 such that for any field k, kQ(ei Homk(kQ, k)) is an indecomposable kQ-module with the dimension vector . Moreover, for any field k, any indecomposable
kQ-module is obtained in this way.

For a positive root  of a quadratic form of Q and a field k, let X,k :=  (ei Homk(kQ, k)) = ei Homk(kQ, k)LkQ+1[-],

where   0 and i  Q0 are given by Proposition 4.10. Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring,  = RQ and
P := ei HomR(, R)L+1[-]  D(Mod ).
Note that P LR (-) = P R (-) holds on D(Mod ) for any complex P  Kb(proj RQ), since all objects in proj RQ is projective over R. We need the following proposition.

Proposition 4.11. For a positive root  of a quadratic form of Q, P is a two-term presilting complex of Kb(proj ) such that P LR (p)  H0(P) R (p)  X,(p) holds for any prime ideal p of R.
Proof. We first show that P LR (p)  X,(p) for any prime ideal p of R. Let S = iQ0 Rei and M = aQ1 Ra. Then  = RQ is the tensor algebra of the S-bimodule M , that is,  = TS(M ), which is free of finite rank over R. We have a projective bimodule resolution of  as follows:
0   S M S  -f  S  -   0,
where  is a multiplication map and f (amb) = amb-amb. By applying the functor HomR(, R) (-), we have a short exact sequence of -bimodules:

0  HomR(, R) S M S   HomR(, R) S   HomR(, R)  0.

(4.4)

This sequence is a projective resolution of a right -module HomR(, R). Let

C := (HomR(, R) S M S   HomR(, R) S ) .

For a prime ideal p of R, let k = (p). By applying the functor (-) R k to (4.4), we have a short exact sequence of kQ-bimodules such that C LR k is a projective resolution of a right kQ-module Homk(kQ, k). Then P  eiCLR+1[-]  D(Mod ), and

(C L C L    L C) LR k  (C L C L    L C) LR (k LR k LR    LR k)  (C LR k) L    L (C LR k)  (C LR k) LkQ    LkQ (C LR k)

(4.5)

Therefore we have P LR k (4.5) ei(C LR k)LkQ+1[-] = ei Homk(kQ, k)LkQ+1[-] = X,k.
We show that P is a two-term presilting complex of Kb(proj RQ). Since any indecomposable kQmodule is  -rigid, P LR k is a two-term presilting complex of Kb(proj kQ). By [Ki, Proposition 4.2], (P)p is a two-term presilting complex of Kb(proj RpQ) for any prime ideal p. Thus by Proposition 2.14, P is a two-term presilting complex of Kb(proj RQ).

For a basic kQ-module M

we

that

For a subcategory C  mod kQ which is closed under direct summands, we denote by ind C the set of

isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules in C. For a kQ-module X, let dim X be the dimension

vector of X. We denote by dim C the set of all dimension vectors of modules in ind C:

dim C := {dim X | X  ind C}.

By Proposition 4.10, C is determined by dim C. In particular, for T  tors kQ, Fp(T ) is also determined by the set dim T .

Lemma 4.12. Let k and k be fields. For a basic kQ-module M and a basic kQ-module M  having the common decomposition type, the following statements hold.
(a) M is kQ-rigid if and only if M  is kQ-rigid. (b) M is a silting module if and only if M  is a silting module.

O. IYAMA AND Y. KIMURA

(c) Assume that M and M  are silting modules, then we have dim(gen M ) = dim(gen M ).

Proof. (a) Since all indecomposable modules are preprojective, by applying [ASS, Chapter IV, 2.15.
Corollary], dimk HomkQ(X,k, X,k) is determined by  and  for any positive roots , . This implies the assertion.
(b) Since M and M  have the common decomposition type, for a vertex i  Q0, eiM = 0 if and only if eiM  = 0. Then (b) follows from (a).
(c) We have gen M = (M ) and gen M  = (M ). Thus by the same reason as (a), we have the
assertion.

Lemma 4.13. Fix a prime ideal p of R and k = (p). Let M be a basic silting kQ-module with the

decomposition type {1, 2, . . . , }. Let I = {i  Q0 | eiM = 0}. Then P =

 j=1

Pj



iI RQei is a

two-term silting complex of Kb(proj RQ) such that for any prime ideal q, H0(P ) R (q) is a basic silting

(q)Q-module with the same decomposition type as M .

Proof. By Proposition 4.11, H0(P ) R (q) has the same decomposition type as M for any prime ideal q of R. Therefore by Lemma 4.12(b), H0(P ) R (q) is a basic silting (q)Q-module. Thus P LR (q) is a two-term silting complex. By Proposition 2.22, Pq is a two-term silting complex. Thus by Proposition 2.14, P is a two-term silting complex of Kb(proj RQ).

We observe that RpQ is semi-perfect.
Lemma 4.14. For each prime ideal p of R, RpQ is semi-perfect and tors(fl RpQ) is a finite set.
Proof. Let  = RQ. We have an indecomposable decomposition as a left module p = iQ0 pei of p = RpQ, where ei is an idempotent associated to the vertex i. Then p/pp = iQ0 p/ppei is an indecomposable decomposition. By Lemma 4.1, p is a semi-perfect ring. By Propositions 2.32 and 4.2, we have bijections
2-silt p - tors(fl p) - tors(p/pp), where the first one is given by gen H0(-)  fl p and the second is given by (-)  mod(p/pp). Since p/pp = (p)Q is a  -tilting finite algebra, these sets are finite.
We need the following lemma.

Lemma 4.15. For each pair p  q, we have the following commutative diagram: 2-silt(RpQ) (-)Rp (p) 2-silt((p)Q) gen H0(-) tors((p)Q) Fp CQ
(-)q
2-silt(RqQ) (-)Rq (q) 2-silt((q)Q) gen H0(-) tors((q)Q) Fq CQ

Moreover all maps in the diagram are bijective.

Proof. Since RpQ is semi-perfect for each prime ideal p, all horizontal morphisms are bijective. Therefore (-)q is bijective if the diagram is commutative.
Let T  2-silt(RpQ) and M := H0(T ) R (p), which is a silting (p)Q-module. By Lemma 4.13, there is P  2-silt(RQ) such that H0(P ) R (p)  M , and N := H0(P ) R (q) has the same decomposition type as M . Since all horizontal maps are bijective, add T = add Pp holds. By Lemma 4.12, dim (gen N ) = dim (gen M ) holds. Therefore we have Fp(gen N ) = Fq(gen M ). This implies that the diagram is commutative.

We give some properties of the path algebra RQ.

Proposition 4.16. Let Q be a Dynkin quiver and R a commutative Noetherian ring. Then  = RQ satisfies the following properties.
(a) For any pair q  p of prime ideals of R, rp, q is an isomorphism. (b) Any compatible element of TR() belongs to the image of  : tors   TR().
Proof. (a) This assertion directly follows from the diagram (4.2) and Lemma 4.15. (b) Let {X p}p be a compatible element of TR(). For each prime ideal p of R, there is a basic silting
(p/pp)-module M p such that X p  mod(p/pp) = gen M p. Fix one prime ideal p. By applying Lemma 4.13, there is P  2-silt  satisfying M p  H0(P ) R (p). We have gen(H0(P )p)  mod(p/pp) = X p  mod(p/pp). This implies that gen H0(P )p  fl p = X p by Proposition 2.32. Thus by Proposition 4.6, {X p}p belongs to Im .
We are ready to prove the main theorem of this subsection.
Proof of Theorem 4.9. By Lemma 4.15, for two prime ideals p  q, the following diagram is commutative:
tors(fl Rp) Hp tors((p)Q) Fp CQ
rp q
tors(fl Rq) Hq tors((q)Q) Fq CQ
where Hp := (-)  mod((p)Q). All morphisms in this diagram are isomorphisms. Let {X p}p be a compatible element of TR(). For each prime ideal p of R, let f (p) := FpHp(X p)  CQ.
Since {X p}p is a compatible element, f is a morphism of posets from Spec R to CQ. Conversely, for a morphism f  Homposet(Spec R, CQ), let Yp := (FpHp)-1(f (p)). Then Y = {Yp}p is a compatible elements of TR(). Clearly these assignments induce bijections between the set of compatible elements of TR() and Homposet(Spec R, CQ).
