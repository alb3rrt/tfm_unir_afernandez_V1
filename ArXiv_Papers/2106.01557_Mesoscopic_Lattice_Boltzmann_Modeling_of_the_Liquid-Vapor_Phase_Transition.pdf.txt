Liquid-vapor phase transition is a widespread phenomenon of great importance in many natural and engineering systems. Because of its multiscale nature and macroscopic complexity [1­6], thermodynamically consistent modeling of liquid-vapor phase transition with the underlying physics is a long-standing challenge, despite extensive studies. Physically speaking, the phase transition is a natural consequence of the molecular interaction at the microscopic level. Therefore, as a mesoscopic technique that can incorporate the underlying microscopic interaction, the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is advocated as a promising method for modeling multiphase flows with phase transition [7­9].
The theory of the LB method for multiphase flows has been extensively studied since the early 1990s [8­12]. However, most studies are inherently limited to isothermal systems, and the theory of the LB method for liquid-vapor phase transition remains largely unexplored. Recently, some liquid-vapor phase transition problems have been simulated by the LB method [13­17], where the popular pseudopotential LB model for isothermal systems is adopted to handle the mass and momentum conservation laws, and a supplementary macroscopic governing equation is employed to handle the energy conservation law. Because of the idea of mimicking the microscopic interaction responsible for multiphase flows, the pseudopotential LB model shows great simplicity in both concept and computation. However, it suffers from thermodynamic inconsistency [7], although the coexistence densities could be numerically tuned close to the thermodynamic results. The supplementary macroscopic energy governing equation is extremely complicated [2, 18] and it is artificially simplified with macroscopic assumptions and approximations in previous works [13­17]. Both thermodynamic consistency and the underlying physics are sacrificed. Moreover, the simplified energy governing equation cannot be recovered from the mesoscopic level, implying that the computational simplicity is also lost.
In this Letter, we first analyze the kinetic model that combines Enskog theory for dense gases with mean-field theory for long-range molecular interaction. Guided by this kinetic model, we develop a novel mesoscopic LB model for liquidvapor phase transition by handling the underlying microscopic

molecular interaction rather than resorting to any macroscopic assumptions or approximations. The present LB model has a clear physical picture at the microscopic level and thus the conceptual and computational simplicity, and it is also kinetically and thermodynamically consistent.
The microscopic molecular interaction responsible for liquid-vapor phase transition generally consists of a shortrange repulsive core and a long-range attractive tail. The short-range molecular interaction can be well modeled by Enskog theory for dense gases, and the long-range molecular interaction can be described by mean-field theory and thus modeled as a point force [19]. Combining Enskog theory for dense gases with mean-field theory for long-range molecular interaction, the kinetic equation for the density distribution function (DF) f (x, , t) can be written as [7]

t f +  ·  f + a ·  f = Enskog + Vmean ·  f , (1) where  is the molecular velocity, a is the external acceleration, and Vmean denotes the mean-field approximation of the long-range molecular potential. The Enskog collision operator Enskog is [20]

Through the ChapmanEnskog (CE) analysis, the following mesomacroscopic governing equations can be derived:

t(u) +  · (uu) = -pBE + Fmean + a +  · ,

(6b)

t(ek) +  · (eku + pBEu) = Fmean · u + a · u +  · (J + u · ), (6c)

where pBE = RT (1 + b) is the equation of state (EOS) for dense gases recovered by the Enskog collision operator,

Fmean = -Vmean is the point force for the long-range molecular interaction,  is the viscous stress tensor, and J denotes

the energy flux by conduction. Note that Eq. (6) should be

viewed as mesomacroscopic rather than macroscopic govern-

ing equations because the involved Fmean and ek cannot be well defined from the macroscopic viewpoint.

Equation works. To

molecular potential is given as [19]

Vmean =

where x and x2 are the positions of two interacting molecules, V(|x2 - x|) is the distance-dependent potential. Performing Taylor series expansion of (x2) centered at x, Eq. (7) can be formulated as

The last term in Eq. (10) refers to the work done by surface

moment of the density at the mesoscopic level,

DF, is more although e

is extensively involved at the macroscopic level. Inspired by

the above analysis, we will develop a mesoscopic LB model

to recover Eq. (6) rather than Eq. (10), and the key points are recovering a nonideal-gas EOS like pBE that corresponds to the short-range molecular interaction and mimicking the long-range molecular interaction. Note that both the shortand long-range molecular interactions should be included in physically modeling liquid-vapor phase transition. Otherwise, the liquid-vapor system will suffer from density collapse or be homogenized. Before proceeding further, some discussion on the kinetic model is useful. With Eq. (8), the pressure tensor can be calculated as

where pEOS = pBE - a2 is the full EOS. Obviously, the above P is consistent with thermodynamic theory.

Based on Eq. (6) derived from the kinetic model, we introduce double DFs: the density DF fi(x, t) for the mass and momentum conservation laws and an innovative, simple yet effective, total kinetic energy DF gi(x, t) for the energy conservation law. The standard D2Q9 lattice [21] is considered here for simplicity, and the extension to three dimensions is straightforward. The LB equations for fi and gi are given as

The technical details of the present mesoscopic LB model (including the equilibrium moments meq and neq, the collision matrices S and L, the discrete force Fm, the discrete source qm, etc.) are given in Supplemental Material [24]. Performing the second- and third-order CE analyses for the above LB model, the mesomacroscopic governing equations from the kinetic model [i.e., Eq. (6)] can be recovered once we set

pBE = pLBE, Fmean = Fpair + Riso + Radd, hk = ek + pBE,

Therefore, thermodynamic consistency naturally emerges from our mesoscopic LB model developed in accordance with the kinetic model. Note that there exist some additional cubic terms of velocity in recovering the viscous stress tensor [27, 28], which are ignored with the low Mach number condition and can also be eliminated by trivial modifications [23, 29]. Moreover, the present LB model shows satisfactory numerical stability due to the separate incorporations of the short- and long-range molecular interactions and the introduction of an innovative, simple yet effective, total kinetic energy DF.

Note that the scaling factors KEOS and KINT are introduced to adjust the surface tension   K K EOS INT and interface thickness W  KINT.
To test the applicability of our mesoscopic LB model for liquid-vapor phase transition, we perform simulations with
= 1/6, 1 = -2, 2 = 2, a~ = 1, b~ = 4, R = 1, and x = 1. The reduced temperature (Tr = T/Tcr) is set to Tr,0 = 0.8, and the surface tension  = 0.01 and interface thickness W = 10, which indicate that KEOS = 0.479820 and KINT = 2.294922. The kinematic viscosities and heat conductivities of the liquid and vapor satisfy l = v and l = 10v, respectively. A higher temperature Tr,1 = 0.85, together with the outflow and constant-pressure condition, is applied to drive the phase transition. This boundary condition is treated by the improved nonequilibrium-extrapolation scheme [31]. Meanwhile, eliminating the additional cubic terms of velocity is also plugged into the LB model [29]. Before simulating liquid-vapor phase transition, an equilibrium droplet in periodic domain is considered. The numerical results of  and W, measured by Laplace's law and circular fitting, are 0.0101676 and 9.961104, respectively. Such good agreements with the prescribed values validate the present LB model. Subsequently, the one-dimensional Stefan problem is simulated on a 1024x × 4x domain heated from the left side. Neglecting convection and taking the sharp-interface limit, the analytical location of liquid-vapor phase interface can be obtained [32]:

Xi(t) = 2k v(t + t0),

(20)

where v = v (vcv), t0 shifts the initial location, and k is the root of the transcendental equation

(21)

where the Stefan number is defined as Ste = vcvTcr(Tr,1 -

convection in Fig. 1. It

can be seen that liquid-vapor phase transition is successfully

and accurately captured by the present LB model. The vapor

slowly flows to the left with its temperature gradually rising

from Tr,0 to Tr,1, while the liquid stays at rest with a uniform temperature Tr,0. Across the phase interface, the density profile can be well maintained, and the pressures in vapor and

liquid balance each other (the jumps of pEOS within the phase interface come from the nonmonotonic EOS for liquid-vapor

fluids). Moreover, the location of phase interface agrees very

well with the analytical result, which suggests that the latent

heat of vaporization in the mesoscopic LB model is naturally

consistent with thermodynamic theory.

A liquid droplet with diameter D0 = 256x is then simulated on a 1024x × 1024x domain heated from all the four

sides. The Stefan number is set to Ste = 0.005 and thus

convection in the evaporation is quite weak. Figure 2 shows

the time evolution of the square of the normalized diame-

ter (D/D0)2, together with four snapshots of the local density and temperature fields. Here, the time is normalized as

4 between two merging droplets is a kind of capillary condensation in thermodynamic theory [37, 38]. For Ste = 0.05 and 0.5, evaporation becomes much faster and convection is very strong. The two droplets repulse each other rather than attract, and the droplet lifetime is much shorter than that for Ste = 0.005. As seen in Fig. 3(b) and 3(c), the vapor outflows originating from the droplet surfaces impact each other in the middle region between the two droplets, and thus the pressure in this region obviously increases, which then pushes the two droplets away from each other against the imbalanced vapor recoil force.

the interface thickness and droplet temperature can be well

maintained at the prescribed values. As a further applica-

tion, the evaporation of a large-small droplet pair is simulated

with Ste = 0.005, 0.05, and 0.5, respectively. Initially, the di-

ameters of the two droplets are 160x and 96x, respectively, and the distance between the droplet centers is 256x. Figure 3 shows the snapshots of the local temperature and velocity

fields, and the time evolution of the normalized volume V/V0.

Here, D0 =

V is the total volume of the droplets, V0 = 128x. For Ste = 0.005, the evaporation is

and the two droplets attract each other and coalesce into a sin-

gle one. This attraction-coalescence behavior is due to the

nonuniform evaporation rate along droplet surface, which is

induced by the other droplet and will result in an imbalanced

vapor recoil force [6]. Such unusual behavior of evaporating

droplets under slow evaporation condition is consistent with

the recent experimental and theoretical results [35, 36]. In-

terestingly, the local temperature slightly rises [see the mid-

dle panel in Fig. 3(a)] and the normalized volume slightly in-

creases [see the "kink" in Fig. 3(d)] when the coalescence oc-

curs, which can be explained as follows: At the neck formed

by coalescence, the phase interface changes from convex to

concave, and the local saturated vapor pressure will decrease

according to the Kelvin equation in thermodynamic theory

[19]. Therefore, the vapor nearby the neck becomes super-

saturated and then condenses into liquid, resulting in the re-

lease of latent heat and also the increase of droplet volume.

Here, it is noteworthy that the above condensation at the neck

In summary, we have developed a novel mesoscopic LB model for liquid-vapor phase transition, where the short- and long-range molecular interactions are incorporated by recovering an EOS for dense gases and introducing a pairwise interaction force, respectively, and an innovative, simple yet effective, total kinetic energy DF is proposed for the energy conservation law. The same mesomacroscopic governing equations as the kinetic model can be recovered, and thus thermodynamic consistency is naturally satisfied. Because of the successful modeling of the underlying microscopic molecular interaction, the present mesoscopic LB model does not rely on any macroscopic assumptions or approximations and has the potential to provide reliable physical insights into the liquidvapor phase transition processes.

To recover a nonideal-gas EOS like pBE, the equilibrium moment meq and discrete force Fm in the LB equation for density DF [i.e., Eq. (12b) in the main text] are devised as

meq = , -2 + 2 + 3|u^ |2,  +  - 3|u^ |2, u^ x, -u^ x, u^y, -u^y, u^2x - u^2y, u^ xu^y T,

where u^ = u/c, F^ = F/c,  = -2 (1 - ), and  is a built-in variable. Here, is a model coefficient related to the bulk viscosity. In the LB equation for total kinetic energy DF [i.e., Eq. (12c) in the main text], the equilibrium moment neq and discrete source qm are devised as

neq = ek, -4ek + (4 + 1)CrefT, 4ek - (4 - 2)CrefT, hku^ x, -hku^ x, hku^y, -hku^y, 0, 0 T,

where Cref is a reference volumetric heat capacity, hk is named the total kinetic enthalpy, and 1,2 are model coefficients related to the heat conductivity. To correctly recover the meso-macroscopic governing equations derived from the kinetic model [i.e.,

Furthermore, the relaxation parameters in S should satisfy pq = (k + 1)eq = 1/12 with e,p,q = s-e,1p,q - 1/2. The last term in Eq.
