In quantum electrodynamics with charged chiral fermions, a background electric field is the source of the chiral anomaly which creates a chirally imbalanced state of fermions. This chiral state is realized through the production of entangled pairs of right-moving fermions and left-moving antifermions (or vice versa, depending on the orientation of the electric field). Here we show that the statistical Gibbs entropy associated with these pairs is equal to the entropy of entanglement between the right-moving particles and left-moving antiparticles. We then derive an asymptotic expansion for the entanglement entropy in terms of the cumulants of the multiplicity distribution of produced particles and explain how to re-sum this asymptotic expansion. Finally, we study the time dependence of the entanglement entropy in a specific time-dependent pulsed background electric field, the so-called "Sauter pulse", and illustrate how our re-summation method works in this specific case. We also find that short pulses (such as the ones created by high energy collisions) result in an approximately thermal distribution for the produced particles.

I. INTRODUCTION
The notion of entanglement played a key role in the development [1] and validation [2] of quantum mechanics. It also plays a crucial role in the rapidly developing field of quantum computing, where entangled qubits may provide an exponential improvement over classical computers, see e.g. [3].
The precise role played by entanglement in quantum field theory is, however, still an open question. One of the first contributions in this direction was made in [4], where it was shown that the entanglement entropy between a massless free field inside an imaginary sphere and the rest of the system (described as a "bath"), reproduces the famous "area law" of black hole thermodynamics. In a parallel development, the spatial dependence of the entanglement entropy in conformal field theories was established, with its logarithmic dependence on the size of the subregion [5, 6], see [7] for a review. The link between entanglement, quantum chaos, and thermalization is under active current investigation, see for example [8­13] and references therein.
Another question that has recently sparked interest is the extent to which the renormalization group flow, which connects high (UV) and low (IR) energies, can be understood in terms of momentum-space entanglement between the UV and the IR degrees of freedom [14­16]. It also starts to become clear that the concept of entanglement in quantum field theory is not only of academic interest but can have important implications, see e.g. [17­26] where diverse ideas related to entanglement were put forward in an attempt to understand thermalization in high energy heavy-ion collisions.

High energy hadron collisions are accompanied by the production of copious quark-antiquark pairs. To investigate the role that quantum entanglement plays in this process, here we will study the entanglement entropy between fermions and antifermions produced in strong electric fields. For simplicity, we deal with 1 + 1 dimensional electrodynamics; however, our results can be easily extended to 3 + 1 dimensions as well.
The main two results of this paper are the following. First, we show that the statistical Gibbs entropy associated with the created pairs is equal to the entanglement entropy between right and left movers (we refer to this as "chiral entanglement"). This result elucidates the microscopic quantum origin of the statistical entropy of the produced state. Second, we derive an explicit relation between the entanglement entropy and the multiplicity distribution of created particles and show how it can be used in practice to reconstruct the entanglement entropy from the knowledge of the (few) cumulants of the multiplicity distribution.
To this aim, we start in section II by rederiving the results of [27] and compute the entanglement entropy between particles in a pair created by a background electric field. We then compare it to the Gibbs entropy associated with the system of the created pairs and show them equal. We then move on to section III and relate the entanglement entropy to the cumulants of the multiplicity distribution of produced particles. The asymptotic expansion we find is the same as the one previously derived in the context of shot noise in quantum point contacts ("full counting statistics") [28]. We also show how to re-sum this expansion for practical applications. Then, in section IV, we study the time evolution of the entanglement entropy for a particular time dependence of the electric pulse ("Sauter pulse"). We observe that in the case of short pulses, the asymptotic values are approached in a universal way. Finally, we show how our

2

re-summed expression can be used in practice to evaluate the entanglement entropy from the multiplicity distribution of produced particles. In particular, we show that it provides a substantial improvement over the original asymptotic expansion. We conclude in section V by summarizing our results and presenting an outlook.

II. CHIRAL ENTANGLEMENT AND GIBBS ENTROPY

For the clarity of the argument, we will consider 1+1D massive fermions coupled to a background electric field

S = d2x ^¯ iµµ + A1(t)1 - m ^ .

(1)

with µ the Dirac matrices, A1(t) a homogeneous, timedependent background gauge field, working in the (+, -) signature and with ¯ = 0 the usual Dirac conjugate.
We emphasize that this choice is out of convenience; the computations can also be carried for free fermions in a purely electric background in 3+1 dimensions. Throughout this work, we will be concerned with pair creation, associated entropies, and thermalization. To tackle these questions, it will prove convenient to use the method of Bogoliubov transformations [29], see [30­33] for examples and reviews.
At any instant of time t, the Hamiltonian associated to (1)

free solutions u±A1 of the Dirac equation (7) in a timeindependent background A1;

±±k1,t (t) = u±A1(t)(t, ±k1) .

(8)

For an explicit form of the free spinors u±A1 , see appendix A.
The fact that these creation and annihilation operators diagonalize the Hamiltonian at time t means that they define the concept of free particles at t = t. Conversely, they also define the notion of the vacuum state at t = t;
it is the state annihilated |t by ak1,t and bk1,t

ak1,t |t = bk1,t |t = 0 .

(9)

In this language, particle creation directly comes from
the fact that the vacuum is not uniquely defined; what is
the vacuum state at some time will correspond to some
excited state at some later time. We will consider situa-
tions with limt- A1(t) = A-, namely backgrounds where the electric field is switched-off at t = -, and ask
what is the particle content of this initial vacuum state |- at time t = t. To do so, we relate the asymptotic operators to the ones at time t using a Bogoliubov
transformation

ak1,t = k1,t ak1,- + k1,t b-k1,- b-k1,t = k1,t b-k1,- + k1,t ak1,- .

(10) (11)

As the anticommutation relations (4) must be satisfied at all times, we have the following constraints

Ht =

dx1^¯(t, x1) -1 (i1 + A1(t)) + m ^(t, x1) (2)

is diagonalized by introducing creation and annihilation operators ak1,t , ak1,t , bk1,t , bk,t satisfying the usual anticommutation relations

{ak1,t , aq1,t } = {bk1,t , bq1,t } = 2(k1 - q1) (3)

{ak1,t , bq1,t } = {ak1,t , bq1,t } = 0 .

(4)

Indeed, expanding the field operator as

^(t, x1) = ^¯(t, x1) =

dk1e-ik1x1

+k1,t (t)ak1,t + --k1,t (t)bk1,t (5)

dk1eik1x1

¯+k1,t (t)ak1,t + ¯--k1,t (t)bk1,t , (6)

with ±±k1,t (t) solutions to the Dirac equation for the momenta modes
i00 + 1(k1 + A1(t)) - m ±±k1,t (t) = 0 , (7) it is easy to see that Ht is diagonal, provided that the mode functions at time t, ±±k1,t (t) reduce to the

|k1,t |2 + |k1,t |2 = 1, |k1,t |2 + |k1,t |2 = 1, (12)

k1,t k1,t + k1,t k1,t = 0

(13)

and find that only two out of the four coefficients are
independent. Consistently with the constraints and the
fact that k1,- = k1,- = 1, k1,- = k1,- = 0 , we set

k1,t = k1,t , k1,t = -k1,t .

(14)

These coefficients can readily be extracted from the knowledge of the mode functions ±k1,-. First we plug the transformations (10)-(11), taking into account the
constraints (14), into (5). Regrouping by operator and comparing with the field expansion (5) around t = -,
we find

+k1,t (t) = u+A- (t, k1)k1,t - u-A- (t, -k1)k1,t . (15)

We can then use the normalization (A7) of the free spinors together with their orthonormality relations (A8) to invert this relation. This allows us the compute the Bogoliubov coefficients as

k1,t = u+A-   (t, k1)+k1,t (t) k1,t = -u-A-   (t, -k1)+k1,t (t) .

(16) (17)

3

Note that one can also get the Bogoliubov coefficients by considering (15) and its derivative with respect to time and taking linear combination [32]. It is easy to show that both methods are equivalent on-shell; the one presented here is more straightforward once the mode functions are known.
The meaning of the Bogoliubov coefficients is clear. In particular, we have

-| ak1,t ak1,t |- = -| b-k1,t b-k1,t |-

= |k1,t |2

(18)

and |k1,t |2 corresponds to the probability of observing at time t, having started out in the vacuum state, a(n) (anti)particle with momentum (-)k.
This interpretation allows us to associate a statistical Gibbs entropy to the system at time t by counting microstates. As we are dealing with fermions, only one particle per momentum can be excited. Thus

The state |Sp contains all the combinations which cannot be written as pairs and is defined such that expressions (20) and (23) are the same. As turning on a homogeneous background electric field preserves all these symmetries, this remainder term will not evolve and will not impact the discussion.
We start from the density matrix associated with the vacuum state

|t = |- -| =

k1,-k1 |t
k1

 |Sp Sp| (24)

with

k1,-k1 |t = 0ak1,-, 0b-k1,-

0ak1,-, 0b-k1,- . (25)

SG =

dk1 1 - |k1,t |2 log 1 - |k1,t |2 + |k1,t |2 log |k1,t |2 ,

(19)

as every momentum is either excited or not. We will now show that the entanglement entropy be-
tween positive and negative frequency modes, or equivalently between left- and right-moving (anti)fermions, as computed from first principles, is equal to the Gibbs entropy (19), elucidating the microscopic origin of this quantity.
The computation of the entanglement entropy was already essentially presented in [27]. For the sake of clarity and self-consistency, we also present it here. In terms of one-particle states, the vacuum reads

|- = |L  |R

(20)

where

|L =

0ak1

k1

|R =

0bq1

q1

(21) (22)

and with the index a resp. b referring to the particle resp. antiparticle Hilbert's space. We used the notation  to indicate that we are dealing with tensor products. Conservation of charge, translational invariance, and timereversal invariance lead us to express the vacuum state
as a tensor products of pairs 0ak1,-, 0b-k1,- with a spectator state |Sp

|- =

0ak1,-, 0b-k1,-
k1

 |Sp .

(23)

The subscript |t is here to remind us we want to evaluate these quantities at time t, namely in the "instantaneous
basis" ak1,t , bk1,t . We also define a reduced density matrix by tracing over half of the particles and the spectator
state

+|t = Tr-k1,Sp (|t ) =

k1 |t

k1

(26)

with

k1 |t = Tr-k1 (k1,-k1 |t ) .

(27)

We want to compute the entanglement entropy associated to this reduced density matrix

SE = -Tr +|t log +|t = dk1Sk ,

(28)

with

Sk = Tr (k1,-k1 |t log (k1,-k1 |t )) .

(29)

Our aim now is to compute Sk. To do so, we expand our state in the instantaneous basis. Conservation of charge leads us to write

0ak1,-, 0b-k1,-

= 0 0ak1,t , 0b-k1,t + 1 1ak1,t , 1b-k1,t

, (30)

leading to

4

k,-k = |0|2 0ak1,t , 0b-k1,t k = |0|2 0ak1,t , 0b-k1,t

0ak1,t , 0b-k1,t + |1|2 1ak1,t , 1b-k1,t 1ak1,t , 1b-k1,t + 01 0ak1,t , 0b-k1,t 1ak1,t , 1b-k1,t + 01 1ak1,t , 1b-k1,t
0ak1,t , 0b-k1,t + |1|2 1ak1,t , 1b-k1,t 1ak1,t , 1b-k1,t

(31) 0ak1,t , 0b-k1,t
(32)

and

Sk = - |0|2 log |0|2 ) + |1|2 log |1|2 ) . (33)

The only missing piece is to relate the 's to the Bogoliubov coefficients. This is done by inverting the transformation (10)-(11)

ak1,- = k1,t ak1,t - k1,t b-k1,t b-k1,- = k1,t b-k1,t + k1,t ak1,t .

(34) (35)

By definition of the vacuum state, we need to have

ak1,- 0ak1,-, 0b-k1,- =! 0

(36)

which implies that, after plugging in equations (30) and (34),

k1,t 1 = k1,t 0 .

(37)

One can check one finds the same condition by imposing bk1,- 0ak1,-, 0b-k1,- =! 0. We can obtain a second consistency condition using the normalisation of the vacuum state

0ak1,-, 0b-k1,- 0ak1,-, 0b-k1,- =! 1 .

(38)

Using again the definitions (30) and (34) we find

|0|2 + |1|2 = 1

(39)

and together with (37) it implies

|0|2 = |k1,t |2 , |1|2 = |k1,t |2 .

(40)

Using equation (33), we obtain

SE = - dk1 |k1,t |2 log |k1,t |2

(41)

+ |k1,t |2 log |k1,t |2 .

Note that this expression was already derived in [27].
Comparing this expression with (19), and using |k1,t |2 = 1 - |k1,t |2, we find

SG = SE .

(42)

We stress again that this result provides a microscopic interpretation of the thermodynamic entropy associated with the particles created: it arises from the microscopic quantum theory as the entropy of entanglement between the particles in a produced pair. The apparent statistical behavior thus originates from the entanglement.

III. RELATION BETWEEN THE ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY AND THE
MULTIPLICITY DISTRIBUTION

The fact that the particles emitted in pairs are entan-

gled must be directly reflected in the multiplicity distri-

bution of created particles. Here, we will make this link

explicit and directly express the entanglement entropy in

terms of the generating function for the multiplicity dis-

tribution of particles. This relation seems to be rather

general as it was already derived in the context of quan-

tum shot noise [28]; here we derive it for arbitrary time-

dependent pulses.

Let us first regularize our theory by temporarily

putting it on a circle of length R (we will then take the

limit R  ). As a result, the momenta are now quan-

tized

pl

=

2l R

.

Let

us

define

Pn

to

be

the

probability

of

creating n fermions. Due to Fermi's exclusion principle,

it can be written as

Pn =

npl

(1 - npq )

 |I |=n

lI

q/I

(43)

with npl the probability to create a particle of momentum pl and I a set of distinct indices. We use the notation |I| to denote the cardinal of I, i.e. the number of indices. This formula is understood as follows: for any combination of n momenta, we require these n momenta to contain a particle (first product) and all other momenta to be empty (second product).
A more concise way to encode this information is obtained by considering its associated generating function


M () = Pnein .
n=0

(44)

It is a generating function in the sense that the mth moment of the distribution of the number of created particles can be obtained by taking derivatives of log(M ()).
By using the explicit definition for the probability of creating n particles (43), we can rewrite this quantity as follows



M () = ein

after having defined

n^ = npl |pl pl|
l
R dk1nk1 |k1 k1| .

(48) (49)

Note it is easy to check that (46) can indeed be expanded into (45). Also, note that (47) can serve as a continuum definition for M (). This allows us to remove our regulator and consider again the infinite volume system.
Now let us see how M () is related to the entanglement entropy. The key reason behind this relation is that M (), or rather its logarithm, can be used to generate a spectral representation of any function of n^. Indeed, we have the following formal relations

log(M ()) = Tr log(1 - (1 - ei)n^)

(50)

= Tr (log(z - n^) - log(z))

(51)

z

= Tr dz

- dz

0 z - n^ 1 z

- log(n^)

(52)

11

z log(M ((z))) = Tr

- z - n^ z

(53)

with z = (1 - ei)-1. As a result, expressions of the type Tr(f (n^)) for f some function of n^ can be represented as

1 Tr(f (n^) - f (0)) = Im


dzf (z)z log (M ((z ± i ))) (54)

where the prescription needs to be chosen appropriately depending on the actual function.
In our case, the probability of creating a pair with momentum k1 is given by the Bogoliubov coefficients nk1 = |k1,t |2. As such we can rewrite the entanglement entropy (41) as

SE = -Tr ((1 - n^) log(1 - n^) + n^ log(n^))

(55)

11

= -Im 

dzz log (M ((z - i )))
0

(56)

· ((1 - z) log(1 - z) + z log(z)) .

This formula is already interesting as it quantitatively shows that the full knowledge of the distribution of produced particles is enough to infer the entanglement entropy between the particles in the pairs.
This expression can be further expanded to directly relate the entanglement entropy to the moments of the distribution of particles. This is interesting as these are what would actually be measured in an experiment. As usual, the moments Cl are obtained from the derivatives of the logarithm of M ()

(60)

where B2l are the Bernoulli numbers, we obtain

SE =



C2l (2l)!

(2)2l|B2l|

.

l=1

(61)

As already mentioned, the same expression was derived for the entanglement entropy produced in quantum shot noise [28] at quantum point contacts. This is not surprising, as the main ingredient in the derivation is the existence of a "full counting statistics" and the fermionic nature of the particles.

Let us further expand this relation. We use the following relation for the Bernoulli numbers [36]

(-1)l-12(2l)!

B2l = (2)2l (2l)

(62)

and rewrite



SE = 2 (2l)C2l

(63)

l=1

with (x) the Riemann  function. This form has the advantage of emphasizing the asymptotic nature of the expansion. The  function quickly approaches unity as l grows and the number of contributions to the moments is factorially growing.

6

Another advantage of this expression is that it can be

analytically extended to a potentially convergent form.

It can be done as follows. First, write the  function as

an absolutely convergent sum for x > 1, (x) =

1 n=1 nx

and then formally swap the two summations


SE = 2

 C2l n2l

n=1 l=1

n=1

(64) (65)

where the first equality can be interpreted as a new definition and where we defined fC(x) to be the following asymptotic expansion around x = 

fC (x) =



C2l x2l

.

l=1

(66)

Because of the generic factorial growth of its coefficients C2l, we consider its Borel transform

BfC (p) =



C2l p2l-1 (2l)!

l=1

(67)

which generically will have a non-zero radius of convergence. The study of this Borel transform will depend on the specific moments C2l. Assuming it does not possess singularities along the positive real axis, it can be used to Borel re-sum fC(x), see [37] for a review,



fC (x) =

dpe-pxBfC (p) .

(68)

0

In case it does, these singularities can be interpreted as some non-perturbative contributions which can be treated by standard methods, see [38] for an introduction.
Equations (65) and (68) are more than just formal manipulations; they can be used to provide an efficient way of computing the entanglement entropy from the knowledge of the multiplicity distribution of particles. This can be achieved for instance by using the Pad´e-Borel methods of [39­41]. We exemplify this fact and its improvement over the bare asymptotic expansion (61) in the next section, where we compute the entanglement entropy in a specific pulsed background from the particle distribution. We stress again that this approach allows

converting a (partial) knowledge of the multiplicity distribution of particles into an (imperfectly reconstructed) entanglement entropy in a practical way.

IV. SAUTER PULSE: "ENTANGLEMENT EQUILIBRATION"

Let us now apply these results to a specific example. We consider the case of the Sauter pulse

E(t) = cosh2

(69)

We compute the associated time-dependent Bogoliubov

coefficients in appendix B.

Let us start by studying the behavior of the entangle-

ment entropy (41) associated with the time-dependent

Bogoliubov coefficients given by equations (B18)-(B19).

We show this quantity in figure 1 for different values of

that the entropy equilibrates to an

In all cases, we see asymptotic value SE.

Moreover, as  becomes smaller, the equilibration hap-

pens on a shorter and shorter time scale and any distinc-

tive feature gets erased ( is sometimes referred to as the

"adiabaticity parameter" [34]).

We observe that as the pulse is getting shorter, the entropy

The asymptotic value for the entropy SE can actually be computed from the well known [31, 34, 42] expressions

These expressions can also be obtained as the late time asymptotics of our time-dependent expressions (B18)(B19). Given the apparent fast equilibriation to this asymptotic regime, a legitimate question to ask is how far from thermality this regime is. To find an answer, we expand these asymptotic Bogoliubov coefficients for small . Focusing on |k1,|2, which corresponds to the distribution of created particles we find

terms of dimensionful parameters in (74). We first ex-

pand in the limit  << 1,  << m and then consider

the two different cases m << 1, m >> 1. In the former

case, we find the spectrum that decays as 1/(m2 + k12)2 while in the latter case the distribution resembles a ther-

a soft "gray factor". This behavior is illustrated in Fig.

2. Note that similar expressions were already discussed

in [34] and the appearance of a "Boltzmann" suppression

for short pulses was discussed in [17].

The momentum distribution (73) is interesting, as it

resembles the transverse momentum spectra measured in

high energy hadron and heavy ion collisions. Of course,

our treatment has been limited to (1 + 1)-dimensional

case, but it is known that for short pulses the momentum

distribution of produced particles is isotropic [17], so the

transverse momentum distributions in this case are also

given by (73). If we model a high energy collision by

an electric pulse, and decompose it in a superposition

of Sauter pulses, then the component with the shortest

duration  would give us a small number (suppressed by

 2, see (73)) of high transverse momentum particles with

a power spectrum  1/(m2 + k12)2. The component with   1/m gives rise to the thermal-like component with

the exponential transverse momentum spectrum. The

effective

to

(73)

is

accord with the semiclassical arguments of [17].

The emergence of an effective thermal behavior is also

manifest in the asymptotic entropy SE. We show its dependence on  , at fixed E and m in Fig. 3. As we will

want to compare it to the thermal case, we normalize by

the density of produced particle Nprod = dk1|k1,|2.

It peaks as  goes to zero and asymptote to some finite

values for large  . An intuition behind this behavior is

the following. Very short pulses  can only probe high fre-

quencies

of particle is the result of a large amplitude quantum

fluctuation. In such a fluctuation, the momentum con-

servation imposes a strong entanglement of the produced

particles. For longer pulses, the momenta of the parti-

cles are correlated through the electric field, and thus the

entanglement entropy per produced particle decreases at

early times, see Fig. 3.

by the exponential factor of equation (74). For small

 , corresponding to large temperatures, the Boltzmann

expression goes to a constant as expected. For finite but

small  , the entanglement entropy per particle for the

Sauter pulse is larger than the thermal case. As explained

above, this can be understood from the fact that the

particles produced by the electric field in this limit result

from large amplitude vacuum fluctuations.

For

the curves cross; for a range of  , the distribution of

created particles is almost thermal. The fact that this

happens

at

is

not

surprising

as

this

corresponds

to pulses that probe modes of order k  m. Finally, for

yet larger  , the entanglement entropy becomes smaller

than in the thermal case; the particles created in pairs are

not "maximally random" and thus differ from a thermal

state.

To conclude this section, we want to compute again the entanglement entropy, but this time only using the moments C2l of the distribution of created particles. From

equation (50), we get

log(M ()) = dk1 log 1 - (1 - ei)|,k1 t|2 , (81)

and, correspondingly, we can directly compute the moments from the Bogoliubov coefficients as

l! l Cl = il l

dk log 1 - (1 - ei)|k|2 .

(82)

For completeness, we write down the few first coefficients which contribute to the entropy

C2 = -4 dk1(|k1,t |4 - |k1,t |2)

As we are performing some numerical evaluation, we can only evaluate a finite number L of moments. This of course would also be the case if we were to perform an experiment, where only a finite number of cumulants can be measured. Let us start by considering expression (63). We show again the time-dependence of the entropy for some given parameters in the left-hand side of Fig. 4, black line. We also show the results obtained by truncating (63) after L terms, for L = 1, 2, 3, 4. The asymptotic nature of this expansion is very clear. The truncations with L = 1, 2, 3 start reproducing the full answer with increased precision but adding terms beyond L = 3 makes the expansion break down, as already illustrated by the L = 4 truncation. In this case, it does not even have the correct qualitative features anymore. Still, it is worth emphasizing that one can get a relatively good idea of what the entanglement entropy is by just using the first moments of the particle distribution.
In order to be able to perform better with more moments and reconstruct the entropy more accurately, we need to resort to the resummation (65). To perform it in practice, we apply the Pad´e-Borel method of [39­41], see also [43, 44] for other concrete examples. It works as follows. First, we construct a truncated Borel transform

BfCL(p) =

L

C2l p2l-1 . (2l)!

l=1

(86)

With infinitely many terms, the "resummation" is realized by then computing the Laplace transform of the Borel transform. With a finite number of terms, nothing would be achieved if we were to directly apply the Laplace transform. A way to understand this is that the resummation is sensitive to the whole analytic structure of the Borel transform. To perform a resummation with a finite number of terms, we need to interpolate the truncated Borel transform with some functions which can capture its global analytic structure. A practical way of doing this is to use Pad´e approximants. One can actually show it is the optimal way to do it for meromorphic functions [40, 41]. This leads us to define an interpolated

FIG. 4. Entanglement entropy as a function of time obtained from the moments of the distribution of created particles. On the l.h.s., we show the entropy obtained from the asymptotic expansion (63) truncated after L terms. On the r.h.s., we show the results obtained with the resummed expression (89).

(88)

with the coefficients an and bm uniquely determined by the requirements that the Taylor expansions of f (x) and Pad´eL,L+1(f )(x) needs to match around x = 0. A priori, the degree of the approximant can be taken to be M, N with M +N = 2L+1 but with M and N arbitrary. While sometimes physical arguments can be used to constraint the choice of M and N [44], here we set M = L and N = L + 1 after some experimentation, realizing that this choice led to particularly stable extrapolations.
Finally, we compute our numerically resummed expression as



fCL(x) =

dpe-pxPBfCL(p) .

(89)

Note that once the approximation fCL(x) is computed, the sum in equation (65) is easy to evaluate.
The results of this resummation are presented on the right-hand side of Fig. 4. Curves with only one and two cumulants are not shown, as they do not lead to any useful results. On the other hand, starting from L = 3, we see an important improvement with respect to the original expansion. And crucially, contrary to the original one, this expansion is convergent; adding higher cumulants only improves the result. This is best illustrated by looking at the results for L = 4 and contrasting them with the one obtained from the asymptotic expansion, on the left-hand side panel. We strengthen this point by also showing results with L = 8 to confirm the fact that we can include more and more cumulants to reconstruct the entanglement entropy if we use the resummed expression (65).

V. CONCLUSION
In this work, we addressed the question of entanglement between pair-produced particles in a strong electric field. We started by deriving the entanglement entropy between the left- and right-movers (or equivalently between the positive and negative frequency modes) and showed that it matches the statistical Gibbs entropy associated with the created pairs. We then made explicit the link between the multiplicity distribution of created particles and the entanglement entropy by deriving an asymptotic expansion of the entanglement entropy in terms of the cumulants of this multiplicity distribution. We also discussed a re-summation of this expression and argued that it provides a practical method for reconstructing the entropy from the cumulants.
Finally, we studied a concrete example. We computed the full time-dependent entanglement entropy between left and right movers in a Sauter-type pulsed electric field. We then studied its late-time behavior and pointed out that the resulting spectrum of created particles is strikingly similar to the transverse momentum distribution observed in high energy hadron and heavy ion collisions. We also studied the asymptotic expansion of the entanglement entropy in terms of cumulants. In particular, we implemented the re-summation proposed above and were able to accurately reconstruct the entanglement entropy, greatly improving over the asymptotic expansion.
This work opens up a number of interesting avenues for future research. For instance, the resemblance of the momentum spectra of particles produced by the Sauter pulses to the spectra measured in high energy hadron and heavy ion collisions and an approximately thermal behavior of multiplicity distributions deserves to be investigated further. Generalizing our results to interacting theories would also be of great interest.

Appendix A: Plane waves spinors

We use this appendix to make our conventions explicit and to write down the explicit form we used for the free spinors. We use the following -matrices

0 =

0 -i i0

,

1 =

0i i0

,

5 = 01.

(A1)

We consider the Dirac equation in a constant A1 background

[i00 + 1(i1 + A) - m]  = 0 .

(A2)

A generic solution is given by

u±A(t, k1) = ei±tik1xu±A(k1) ,

(A3)

with the following dispersion relation

± 2 = m2 + (±k1 + A)2 .

(A4)

We take u±A to be

u+A (k1 )

=

1 
2+

+ - (k1 + A1) i + + k1 + A1

u-A (k1 )

=

1 
2-

- - (k1 - A1) -i - + k1 - A1

.

(A5) (A6)

They satisfy the usual identities

u±A(k1)u±A(k1) = 1 u±A(-k1)uA(k1) = 0

(A7) (A8)

and can be used to expand the free Dirac field in a constant background as

^(x) =

dk1 e-ik1x 2 2

u+A(k1)ak1 + u-A(-k1)bk1

,

(A9)

with ak1 , bk1 free creation/annihilation operators satisfying

{ak1 , aq1 } = {bk1 , bq1 } = 2(k1 - q1) {ak1 , bq1 } = {ak1 , bq1 } = 0 .

(A10) (A11)

Note that in the free expansion we grouped particles by energies (-(-k1) = +(k1)) and that the factor which makes the measure Lorentz invariant is absorbed in the
spinor normalization.

Appendix B: Sauter pulse, explicit formulas

To be able to compute our time-dependent Bogoliubov coefficients in the background (69), we need the associated mode functions (7). This problem was originally solved in [42], and we briefly rederive this solution here. Then, we extract the associated time-dependent Bogoliubov coefficients. We focus on the positive frequency solution as it is the one that is relevant for the Bogoliubov coefficients; the negative frequency solution is obtained in the same way.
Let us write

+k1,t (t) =

+1,t (t) +2,t (t)

,

(B1)

leaving the dependence on k1 of +1,t (t), +2,t (t) implicit for conciseness. Then, the Dirac equation (7) in the background (69) can be rewritten in components as

Note that all the dependence on t, namely the time at which the solutions reduce to the free ones in a constant background, lies in the coefficients c1,t , c2,t . They need to be fixed by matching the two solutions.
In our case, we are interested in the solutions which define the vacuum state at asymptotically early times. Using the fact that 2 F1 (a, b, c, 0) = 1, we compute the asymptotic of (B7) as

+1,t (t) t- c1,t e-itin + c2,t eitin .

(B15)

To match the free spinor solution (A5), we thus need

c1,- =

c2,- = 0 .

Note that the second component 2 is easily computed from (B3).
With the full time-dependent mode function at hand, we can now compute the time-dependent Bogoliubov coefficients using relations (16)-(17). After some algebra, we find

Some more algebra shows that these expressions indeed asymptote to (70)-(71) for t  .
