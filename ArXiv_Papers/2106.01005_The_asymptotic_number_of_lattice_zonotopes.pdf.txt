The asymptotic number of lattice zonotopes
Olivier Bodini, Th´eophile Buffi`ere
Abstract We provide a sharp estimate for the asymptotic number of lattice zonotopes inscribed in [0, n]d when n tends to infinity. Our estimate refines the logarithmic equivalent established by Barany, Bureaux, and Lund when the sum of the generators of the zonotope is prescribed. Since a 2-dimensional zonotope is a centrally-symmetric polygon, this can also be considered a generalization to higher dimension of similar estimates that have been established for 2-dimensional convex chains. As we shall see, the exponential part of our estimate is composed of a polynomial of degree d in n1/(d+1), and involves Riemann's zeta function and depends on the Riemann hypothesis. Our analysis is based on a mapping between sums of coprime numbers and Eulerian polynomials. We also analyse some combinatorial properties of lattice zonotopes. In particular, we provide their average asymptotic diameter when n goes to infinity.

A zonotope is a convex geometric object defined as the Minkowski sum of k segments, called its gener-
ators. More particularly, a lattice zonotope Z (or integral zonotope) is a polytope for whom there exists k  N and v 1, ..., v k  Zd such that, up to translation, Z is:

k

Z=

iv i | 1, ..., k  [0, 1] .

i=1

The idea of enumerating geometric objects of this kind is a long-standing question: in the late '70s, Arnold bounded the number of convex lattice polytopes with area A up to the affine transformations of Z2 [1], showing that it behaves roughly like A1/3. In 1992, B´ara´ny and Pach narrowed those bounds [4], before B´ara´ny and Vershik extended the result to higher dimensions [5]. Vershik later simply asked for the number of lattice polytopes in a box [26]; e.g. in 2 dimensions, the number of convex lattice polygons inscribed in the square [-n, n]2.
A natural intermediate stage is to enumerate the number p(n) of convex lattice chains from (0, 0) to (n, n). In 1994, an asymptotic equivalent of its logarithm is found independently by B´ara´ny [2], Vershik [26], and Sinai [24]. They showed that:

p(n) = exp 31/3n2/3(1 + o(1)) ,

where

More recently, Bodini et al. [7] and Bureaux and Enriquez [10] computed the asymptotic equivalent of the number of convex lattice chains. The former used analytic combinatorics tools that we are using in this paper, and starts from the study of the convex polyominoes. The latter started from Sinai's model, and use the local limit theorem from Bogatchev and Zarbaliev [9]. They both got:

p(n) 

e-2  (-1)

,

with I is a sum over the non-trivial zeros of  and under Riemann hypothesis, I

 1/3 n

is of order O(n1/6).

Eventually, computing the number of lattice polytopes still remains an open question as stepping up from convex lattice chains to convex polygons requires a thorough work over the convergence of the connections of the chains. More broadly zonotopes, as Minkowski sums of segments, are more of a combinatorial object than a geometric one. They remain important objects. They can be used when solving systems of polynomial equations [19] and for computing simplifications in spatial representation [21]. From a theoretical perspective, they appear in the theory of the simplex method [11], in the study of polytope diameters [14], and in relation with primitive Erhrart theory [13, 22]. Evaluating their number is one more step in our comprehension of those objects and their relation to convex polytopes.

Finally, we wish to stress that the question of enumerating polytopes in a convex body K is closely

related proved

to the limit shape of the existence of such

the logarithmic asymptotic estimator of zonotopes in a cone, ending at a given point. They computed the

logarithmic number of lattice zonotopes inside a cone C that ends at a prescribed point nk which gives,

in the case of the zonotopes inscribed in a cube and ending at diagonally opposed points:

d+1

d

(d + 1)n d+1 .

It is to be pointed up that our result takes into account every zonotope only considering their size, and considers the size of the hypercube they're contained in rather than a cone or a set of prescribed vertices, as we place ourselves on the line of Vershik's question. We hereby establish an asymptotic estimate in any given dimension, obtaining in the process interesting results such as a general mapping between sums of coprime numbers and Eulerian polynomials, estimation of the average and the variance of the number of generators and other similar results, and the asymptotic equivalent itself, which involves a certain polynomial in the exponential. We use generating functions, broadly spread in analytic combinatorics (see for instance Flajolet and Sedgewick [16]). This method can be seen as a combinatorial equivalent to Sinai's model using Boltzmann-like probabilities and then applying local limit theorems (see [10, 24] and Bogatchev and Zarbaliev [9]). It is used for instance to study graphs (and in particular trees or graphs embedded in surfaces [6]) or in -calculus [8]. Here the result of [3] is refined, and the results of [10] generalized as follows:

Theorem 1. Let d  N, d  2. Denote by zd(n) the number of convex lattice zonotopes inscribed in [0, n]d. As n grows large:

zd(n)  dnd exp

1
Qd(n d+1 ) + Jcrit(d, n)

,

(2)

where Qd is a polynomial of degree d. All the parameters, d, d  R, Qd and Jcrit(d, n), are defined in (15) in Section 4.

which

the

results

presented

before.

This result naturally suggests two major remarks. Firstly, unexpectedly, the generalization of the exponential part is not a monomial as is in 2 and 3 dimensions (see below) but a polynomial of the d + 1-th root of the size of the box.

2

Moreover, the use of the  function in the denominator forces us to keep the residues of the non-trivial zeros of , as was already observed in 2 dimensions. In the final section, we discuss the value of this term, and extend the results of [7, 10] that show that Jcrit is negligible in 2 dimensions for "computably" large n (typically < 1050) due to the decrease of  function when it gets away from the real line.

To illustrate this theorem, we give the 2, 3, and 4 dimensional asymptotic number of zonotopes in the hypercube of side n:

An other significant unanswered question is the largest possible diameter of the graph of a polytope
of a given size, a question that lead, for instance, to the Hirsch conjecture. Along with its own scientific
interest, its connection to the complexity of the simplex algorithm makes upper bounds of this quantity
actively looked for (see [11] for more references). Zonotopes are widely studied in this perspective as it has been conjectured that the largest possible diameter of a polytope contained in [0, n]d is achieved by a zonotope [12, Conjecture 3.3]. The largest possible diameter of a lattice zonotope contained [0, n]d is given in [13] for all n and d, and its exact asymptotic behavior when d is fixed and n goes to infinity in [14].The
method used in this paper and the result established in Theorem 1 leads to estimate statistical parameters
of lattice zonotopes such as the average number of generators in a zonotope, which is the diameter of their
graph [12]. We hereby computed the asymptotic estimates of the mean and the variance of the distribution of the diameter of zonotopes inscribed in [0, n]d.

Theorem 2. Let µndiam the mean and (2)ndiam the variance of the distribution of the diameter of a lattice zonotope inscribed in [0, n]d. They are asymptotically equivalent to:

We also establish the similar result for the number of lattice points crossed by a prescribed generator (that we will see as the number of occurrences of a primitive generator, meaning non-zero coordinates are coprime).

This article is organized as follows. We begin with a section devoted to establishing the generating function associated to the combinatorial class of zonotopes using the symbolic method. The resulting infinite product is asymptotically estimated in the third section but previously, we spend some time on matching sums of coprime numbers with Eulerian polynomials which makes it possible to carry out the calculations in any dimension. Theorem 1 is established in fourth section using multi-dimensional saddlepoint methods (using the extension to higher dimensions by Gittenberg and Mandlburger's work [18]) over

3

the dominant singularity of the generating function in order to obtain the asymptotic equivalent of its series coefficients. Finally the last two sections are respectively dedicated to discussing the obtained asymptotic equivalent and to computing the estimated average and variance of the number of non-collinear generators and the number of occurrences of a given generator.

1 Class of zonotopes and generating function

Let d  N be the dimension. As said before, a lattice zonotope is, up to translation, a Minkowski sum of segments, one end of whose is in the lattice Zd, and the other is 0. Looking for inscribed zonotopes

brings us to consider lattice zonotopes up to translation thereafter. Given a lattice zonotope Z and a set

v 1, .., v k  Zd \ {0} such that
k

Z=

ivi | 1, ..., k  [0, 1] .

i=1

A set of generators of Z defines it uniquely but the inverse is not true. We denote Zon the set of lattice

zonotopes up to translation and define the size of a lattice zonotope:

Definition 1. The function s defined over Zon as

k
s(Z) = ||vi||1
i=0

is a size function, in particular, it is independent of the chosen set (v1, .., vk) of generators.

The combinatorial specification that is done in this section is known as the symbolic method (see for instance [16, Chapter 1]). With the size function previously defined, Zon becomes a combinatorial class (with a finite number of object for a given the size). This class arises naturally from the set of generators given the definition of lattice zonotopes. Yet, without restrictions on this set, the generator set of one zonotope is not unique. This leads us to be a little more specific about that set in order to have one-to-one correspondence between a lattice zonotope and its set of generators.

Firstly, we restrain generators to the set of primitive vectors denoted Pd (and respectively denote the set of positive primitive vectors Pd+). A segment is said primitive if its intersection with the lattice Zd is exactly its extremities. In the case of vectors, it implies that the non-zero coordinates are coprime (in case
of one nonzero coordinate, it is 1).

Secondly, we consider zonotopes up to translation. In order to do that, following the convention from [12], we restrict ourselves to the set of primitive vectors whose first non-zero coordinate is positive (denoted P(Zd)). By this convention, two generators in this set are never collinear.
Now given a lattice zonotope Z, the set {v 1, ..., v k}  P(Zd) that generates Z is unique. This leads to the following:
Proposition 1 (Analytic combinatorics specification of the class of lattice zonotopes). Let P(Zd)  Zd be the set of primitive vectors defined previously, the class of lattice convex zonotopes Zon is specified as follow:
Zon = MSet(P(Zd)).
We now introduce the generating function of lattice zonotopes, the construction of which is very naturally based on the specification, matching the nth coefficient of the series with the number of n-sized objects of the class. We use in the following proposition the variable  to encode the total size of lattice zonotopes, and the variable xi the size along the ith coordinate.

4

Proposition 2. The generating function of the class Zon is





Zon(x, ) = d (1 - xi)-1 d 



i=1

=2 1i1<...<id ni1 ,...,ni >0

ni1 ...ni =1

1 - xin1i1 ...xini 

2-1

nik -1

.

Proof. A multiset over P(Zd) can be seen as the product of the sequences of each terms over P(Zd) (where each of these terms are defined in [16], e.g the sequence of an object  is the set {, , (, ), (, , ), ...}).

Then Zon(x , ) can be written Zon(x , ) =

v P(Zd) 1 -

1id xi|vi|||v||1

-1
.

One can see that for one v with  non-zero coordinate, there are exactly 2-1 vectors w in P(Zd) that verify ||v ||1 = ||w ||1 and for each i, |vi| = |wi|. They can therefore be grouped together as they have the same contribution in the generating function.
In summary, [xn11][xn22]...[xndd ]Zon(x , 1) is equal to the number of lattice zonotopes inscribed in a box of size n1 × n2 × ...nd.

In the sequel, to lighten the notation and facilitate calculations, we will use the change of variable xi = e-i. This choice can be seen as a standard calculus tool for the following derivations but in our case, it also shows the deep connection between the generating function and Boltzmann-like probabilities used
in Sinai's model [10]. Besides, as the variable  is redundant with (xi)1id, we'll fix  = 1 for the rest of the paper. Therefore, in the absence of further information in the beginning of each section, the generating
function becomes

Zon e -, 1 = Zon e- =

1 - e-<,v> -2

i ½vi=0-1 ,

(3)

v Pd+

where  = (1, ..., d), e- = e-1, ..., e-d , and "<, >" denotes the canonical inner product of Rd.

In order to obtain the asymptotic equivalent of the coefficients of this function for any d (obtained

through a multidimensional saddle point method), we set in the following section general results for sums

of type

start

with

a

reminder

about

Eulerian

polynomials.

2 Study of sums of coprime numbers

Eulerian polynomials were introduced by Leonhard Euler [15], and they have been studied and applied since then. They come from considering the number A(n, m) of permutations of 1, 2, ..., n such that the image of exactly m integer are greater than the one preceding them (for example for the identity m = n-1). The Eulerian polynomials are defined recursively as:

A0(y) = y, and

An(y) =

n m=0

A(n,

m)yn-m.

Hence the first Eulerian polynomials are A1(y) = y, A2(y) = y2 + y, A3(y) = y3 + 4y2 + y.

2.1 Eulerian summation of coprimes

Let be r  N, i  Nr and n  N. We introduce the sum

p1+p2+...+pr=n p1 p2 ...pr =1

pi22

...pirr

with

the

aim

to

asymp-

totically estimate it. We denote it Sn(i), and j = 1 · i. Note that Sn(i) is the sum of a power function over

the primitive points contained in the surface of the dilates of the (r - 1)-dimensional standard simplex. It

is noteworthy that the number of such points has been computed in [13] and that more generally a coprime

Ehrhart theory is introduced in [22].

Property 1.

The nth Eulerian polynomial is of degree n except for A0(y) = y and has no constant term which causes

the degree of

to

be

than

j

+ r.

We

write

it

as

follows:

r
Ai (y) = Bi(y) = bi,j+ryj+r + ...bi,1y.
=1

Despite this heavy notation, the sums under study in the zonotopal case are usually Sn(0), Sn(1, 0, ..., 0) or Sn(2, 0, ..., 0), making Bi(y) equal to yd, yd+1, or yd+2 + yd+1.

2.2 Mellin transform
Mellin transforms appear naturally in the asymptotic analysis of infinite products (see [7, 16, 18]). In the following, the analysis of zonotopes will require to apply a Mellin transform on sums of coprime numbers. The following proposition is of primary importance in the sequel:

6

Property 2. For t > 0, the Mellin transform of n1 Sn(i)e-nt is





1 (s -

j)

j+r

n=0

bi,n

j+r-1
ks

(s) .

(6)

Proof. As we do throughout the paper, we use the change of variables y = e-t and will always try to write products as sums, to have an expression compatible with the Mellin transform. This leads to:

Sn(i) e-nt k =

We can now make use of the Mellin transform which is the transform that matches the exponential with the Gamma function:

+

s, (s) > 0, (s) =

e-tts-1dt.

0

Under conditions that will be detailed just below, the Mellin transform of a function f the expression

is defined as

+

M f e-t (s) =

f e-t ts-1dt.

0

For (s) > j + r - 1, the term

( ) k+j+r-n-1 j+r-1

n0

ks

is bounded, which makes the use of Fubini's theorem

possible, so the Mellin function of n1 S(i)e-nt can be written, on the one hand:

and on the other hand:

+

+

kj Sn(i)e-nktts-1dt = (s - j)

Sn(i)e-ntts-1dt.

0 k0 n1

0 n1

These holomorphic functions being defined and equal on (s) > j + r - 1, we can extend it to its meromorphic continuation on C.

The Mellin transform is widely used to estimate asymptotic behaviors using its correspondence with
the poles of the transformed function, as we will do in next subsection (and as it is done in [7] and [10]). Property 2 make it possible to compute the asymptotic equivalent of any of the sums n1 Sn(i)yn near y = 1.

2.3 Riemann's non trivial zeros challenge, with the example p<n p2 pn=1
We use this subsection to detail more specifically the way the Mellin inversion formula is handled, as we will encounter it multiple times. Riemann's  function intervenes in it, and its non-trivial zeros too. We will use the integral of [10] to manage all the zeros in the critical strip with an integral, but we could also write a sum over all non-trivial zeros. This term is numerically discussed in the Section 5.

As p  n = 1 being equivalent to p  (n - p) = 1, those sums can be rewritten as

The remaining poles of the Mellin transform are the double pole at s = 0, and simple ones at s = 0 and at the non-trivial zeros of (s - 2), which are in the critic strip 2 < (z) < 3, and in the left side of the complex domain.

Now consider the contour  as described in the proposition. The existence of A, such that  surrounds all the zeros of (s - 2) in the critical strip is a consequence of Theorem 3.8 in [25].

3 Analysis of the generating function

In this section, we will compute the asymptotic equivalent of the generating function when all variables xi equally tend to 1 which correspond to the main singularity of the generating function. This will lead us

in the next section to complete the saddle point method using the equivalent found here. To simplify the

notation, we denote, throughout the section:





Zon(x1 = x, ..., xd = x) = Zon(x) = d 

1 - x||v||1 -(d)2-1  .

=1 vP+

Again, in order to establish a general result regarding the dimension d, we need to introduce a sequence of polynomials that will be directly related to the polynomial of Theorem 1. Consequently, we present them along with the notation used in the subsequent paragraph.

3.1 Intermediate sequence of polynomials

As we make use of the Mellin inversion formula over the logarithm of the generating function, for each

 between 1 and d, the coefficient

k-1 -1

from Property 2 will appear with Sn(0, ..., 0). In the rest of the

paper (as well as in Theorem 1 ), we denote:

= Pd(k) = pd,d-1kd-1 + ... + pd,1k + pd,0.

Two properties naturally follow:

As each exponent  of k is reflected in the Riemann  function as (s - ) when using Mellin transform, we introduce an operator over complex functions:

Definition 2. Let M(C) be the field of meromorphic functions in C. We define the operator d as

d : M(C)  M(C)   pd,d-1(· - (d - 1)) + ... + pd,1(· - 1) + pd,0.

4 Proof of the Theorem
The proof of our result relies on the saddle point method in d dimensions. Saddle point analysis consists in fetching the coefficient of the series by using Cauchy's integral formula:

given C  C a circle centered at 0, i  N, 1  i  d,

[xni ]Zon(x )

=

1 2i

Zon(x )xi-n-1dxi.
C

At this point, three steps remain. We first resolve the saddle-point equation, which determines the coordinate n of the saddle point (the point where the derivative of the integrand is null), and then prove the H-admissibility of the generating function, i.e. that the Cauchy integral can be approximated by a Gaussian integral. Eventually, we simply compute the Gaussian approximation, using the asymptotic equivalent of the generating function previously calculated.

4.1 The saddle-point equation

Lemma 2. Denoting n =

2d-1  (d+1)  (d)n

1
, d+1 we have:

 log Zon e- i

= -n + o(n)
=n:=n1

n is called the asymptotic solution of the saddle-point equation.

Proof. We fetch the coefficient of the multivariate series of the generating function by using Cauchy's integral formula and therefore we look for parameters n = (n,1, ..., n,d) such that for all 1  i  d,

 i

log

Z on

e -

+ (n + 1)i

= 0.

=n

(12)

The symmetry of the variables in Zon() implies n,i = n for 1  i  d. The system (12) is then restricted to 1 only:

we

.

Finally get the parameter which is

solution of the saddle equation:

n =

(13)

4.2 H-admissibility
The saddle point method is suitable when the integrand is subject to a abrupt variation, with a major negligible part, and a small one that can be approximated by a Gaussian integral. It can be typically the case if the path along which a function is integrated passes close to a pole. In the 50's, Hayman defined a class of analytic complex functions n anxn, called H-admissible functions, for which one can use this method to estimate the coefficients an [20]. Since then, many extensions of this concept have been made. As we have here a d dimensional space, we will use the work of Gittenberger and Mandlburger [18] that extends the H-admissible class for functions on d-dimensional spaces.

Theorem 3. The function Zon : Cd  C is H-admissible on R = {x  Rd, i |xi| < 1} in the sense of Gittenberger et Mandlburger [18].

This theorem relies on five conditions that we will prove in what follows. In order to prove them, we

use the following notation:

Recall that n =

2d-1 d (d+1)  (d)n

1
d+1 is the solution of the saddle equation and denote xn = exp(-n)

(xn  1 as n  ). To be H-admissible, a function needs to be approximately its Gaussian distribution

(i.e. its logarithm is approximately its own Taylor expand) on a small path.

This path is defined as (n) :=

 = (i)1id, i |i| < n

for



]1

+

d 3

,

1

+

d 2

[.

Finally, a(x ) = (ai(x ))1id, B(x ) = (Bi,j(x ))1i,jd, and C(x ) = (Ci,j,k(x ))1i,j,kd respectively stand for the sets of the first, second, and third order partial derivative of the logarithm of Zon(x ).

13

Lemma 3. Zon(xnei)  Zon(xn) exp

uniformly as ,   (n).

Proof. This is a consequence of the Lagrange form of Taylor's expansion theorem. We compute the asymptotic equivalent of the second and third partial derivatives of the generating function's logarithm (using Mellin transform analysis as in the previous sections):

Bi,j(x n )  (1 + i,j )

2d-1(d + 1)  (d)

(14)

Ci,j,k(x n )  (1 + i,j

+ j,k + k,i + 2i,j,k)

2d-1(d + 1)  (d)

1 nd+3

,

where ij is Kronecker's function (and i,j,k = 1 if i = j = k and 0 otherwise).

To conclude, we need  to ensure

Bi,j (x n )(n)2   and Ci,j,k(x n )(n)3  0

which results in

d+3 3

<<

d+2 2

.

The third order Taylor polynomial with the Lagrange form of the

remainder at  = n ends the proof.

The first and the third points directly follow the asymptotic equivalent we have in (14). As for the second point, it is an outcome of Lemma 4.

5 Numerical elements about the speed of convergence to the asymptotic regime
In this section, we make two numerical remarks about our result, in order to ease the understanding of the behaviour of our result when d and n grow large.

5.1 Order of size of Jcrit
Throughout this paper, we left Jcrit under its integral form but we could also write it as an infinite sum of residues as we did in the introduction, with r ranging over the non-trivial zeros of :

Res
r

1  (r)

d ( (r))  (r)



(r

+

1)(r)

d n

-r
. d+1

This sum is actually invisible for "computably large" numbers n. The density of poles r is known to

be strongly bounded since Selberg in the beginning of the 1940's [23]. Due to this and to the exponential

decrease of  function, the value of Jcrit is with a good approximation the first term of the sum. It is

composed

of

the

term

at

the

first

non-trivial

zero,

approximately

at

r

=

1 2

+

14.13472i

and

of

the

term

at

its

conjugate, which gives for respectively Jcrit(2, n), Jcrit(3, n), and Jcrit(4, n) the following approximations:

16

Jcrit(2, n)  -1.3579×10-10n1/6 cos (4.7116 ln(0.6842n)) - 1.4236×10-9n1/6 sin (4.7116 ln(0.6842n)) , Jcrit(3, n)  -1.2325×10-10n1/8 cos (3.5337 ln(0.2777n)) - 1.2921×10-9n1/8 sin (3.5337 ln(0.2777n)) , (16) Jcrit(4, n)  -3.1764×10-9n1/10 cos (2.8269 ln(0.1305n)) - 8.0628×10-9n1/10 sin(2.8269 ln(0.1305n)).

We can see that the size of these numbers mainly relies on (r). The second non-trivial zero of  is

approximately

in

r

=

1 2

+

21, 02203i,

which

is

smaller

by

10-4

for

the

first

dimensions.

5.2 About moving up in dimension
For a more down-to-earth analysis of the logarithmic equivalent, i.e. the leading term of the exponential term, we can use the expansion of (d) = 1 + 2d + o(2d) as d grows large. One can see that:

2d-1(d + 1)  (d)

1 d+1
=2+O

1 d

,

as d  +.

Therefore, when we get that, in higher dimension, the logarithm of z(n) is nearly equivalent to
d
2(d + 1)n d+1 .

6 The average diameter of Zonotopes
The method we have just applied to the asymptotic number of zonotopes is very generic and can be easily adapted to obtain information on certain parameters (called additives in the symbolic method).
In this section we establish the asymptotic behavior of some of these parameters that can be computed with our generating function approach. To do that, we add a variable u that acts as a counting variable for the parameter. Then the partial derivative along this variable gives us the average value of the quantity under study.
We begin by giving a result similar to Lemma 4.3 of [3] about the number of generators. It gave the average number of generators of a zonotope contained in a given cone and ending at a given point. In the case when the zonotope is contained in a hypercube, this average can also be computed, along with the variance of the number of generators. As said before, the number of generators of a zonotope is the diameter of its graph, which gives Theorem 2.

Proof

of

Theorem

2.

In

the

generating

function,

each

term

1 1-e-<,v >

represents

as

a

series

the

possibility

of having k times the generator v (this is the generating function of the sequence set in the symbolic

method [16]). Therefore the variable u that encodes the number of generator in a zonotope turn each term

into:

+

+

e-k<,v > - 1 + ue-k<,v>.

k=0

k=1

We call Zongen e-, u the generating function defined as such, with the notation  = (1, ..., d) and x = e- = e-1, ..., e-d . The main idea of the rest of the proof is to grasp that the average number of

generator for lattice zonotope inscribed in [0, n]d is given by (see for instance [16, Chapter 3]):

µngen

=

[xn1 ]...[xnd ] uZongen(x , u)|u=1 [xn1 ]...[xnd ]Zon(x )

.

17

We therefore compute the partial derivative along u:





Zongen e-, u u

= 

2 i ½vi=0-1 e-<,v > Zon e - .

u=1

v P(Zd+)

To get the series coefficient, we use the saddle-point method as was done in previous sections. Then we get the asymptotic equivalent of the uni-variate series through the Mellin transform (using Sn(0, ..., 0) and then Pd from previous sections):

2 i ½vi=0-1e-<(t,...,t),v >


t0

2d-1  (d)td

.

v P(Zd+)

As

 Z ongen (e - ,u)
u

is exponentially equivalent to Zon, it is trivially H-admissible, and the solution

u=1

of the saddle equation is the same n. In short, the saddle point method gives for the numerator the same

result as the denominator with multiplying term which is the equivalent freshly calculated. We have:

[xn1 ]...[xnd ] uZongen(x , u)|u=1 [xn1 ]...[xnd ]Zon(x )


n+

2d-1  (d)nd

=

1 (d +

1
1) dd+1

d
n d+1 .

To compute the variance, we need a second order derivative, as one can see that it can be written as

(2)ngen

=

[xn1 ]...[xnd ] uuuZongen(x , u)|u=1 [xn1 ]...[xnd ]Zon(x )

-

µngen 2 .

Evaluating the derivative brings

u uu Z ongen

e-, u

=

u=1

v P(Zd+)

i ½vi=0-1

e-<,v> - e-2<,v> 

2

+ 

2 i ½vi=0-1 e-<,v >  Zon e - .

v P(Zd+)
We see that the second sum is exactly the quantity µngen 2 which means that the equivalent of the variance will be given by the first sum

2
v P(Zd+)

i ½vi=0-1

e-<(t,...,t),v > - e-2<(t,...,t),v >


t0

2d - 1 2 (d)td

.

For the same reasons as before the saddle-point method is giving the following:

[xn1 ]...[xnd ] uuuZongen(x , u)|u=1 [xn1 ]...[xnd ]Zon(x )

-

µngen 2


n+

-

1 2d-1

d+1 d (d + 1)

d
n d+1 .

Finally, the diameter of the graph of a zonotope is equal to its number of generators, by construction,

which is to say

µngen = µndiam,

(2)ngen = (2)ndiam.

18

Theorem 4. The number of occurrences of a primitive generator v0 in a lattice zonotope inscribed in

[0, n]d is distributed with mean µnocc and variance (2)nocc such as:

1

µnocc


n+

n d+1
1

,

dd+1 ||v0||1



1

2

(2)nocc


n+

 n d+1  1 dd+1 ||v0||1

.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we can choose v 0  Zd+. As for the previous parameter, we stress that

the term

1 1-e-<,v 0>

holds in its series form the possibility of having k times v 0.

To insert a variable u

counting for the number of occurrences of v 0, it is substituted for:

+

+

e-k<,v0> -

uk e-k<,v 0 > .

k=0

k=0

Therefore, the generating function Zonocc

e-, u

is defined as Zon

e -

. 1-e-<,v 0 >
1-ue-<,v 0 >

The mean and variance are established as in the previous proof, computing

µnocc

=

[xn1 ]...[xnd ] uZonocc(x , u)|u=1 [xn1 ]...[xnd ]Zon(x )

and

(2)nocc

=

[xn1 ]...[xnd ] uuuZonocc(x , u)|u=1 [xn1 ]...[xnd ]Zon(x )
