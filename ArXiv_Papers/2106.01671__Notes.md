## Abstract

Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware has unavoidable noises, and crosstalk error is a significant error source. When multiple quantum operations are executed simultaneously, the quantum state can be corrupted due to the crosstalk between gates during simultaneous operations, decreasing the circuit fidelity. In this work, we first report on several protocols for characterizing crosstalk. Then, we discuss different crosstalk mitigation methods from the hardware and software perspectives. Finally, we perform crosstalk injection experiments on the IBM quantum device and demonstrate the fidelity improvement with the crosstalk mitigation method.
