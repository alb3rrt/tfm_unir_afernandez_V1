We investigate the scalar-tensor gravity of Damour and Esposito-Fare`se (DEF) with spontaneous scalarization phenomena developed for neutron stars (NSs). Instead of solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for slowly rotating NSs via the shooting method, we construct a reduced-order surrogate model to predict the relations of mass, radius, moment of inertia, effective scalar coupling, and two extra coupling parameters of a NS to its central matter density. We code the model in the pySTGROMX package that speeds up the calculations at two and even three orders of magnitude and yet still keeps accuracy at  1% level. Using the package, we can predict all the post-Keplerian parameters in the timing of binary pulsars conveniently, which allows us to place comprehensive constraints on the DEF theory in a quick and sound way. As an application, we perform Markov-chain Monte Carlo simulations to constrain the parameters of the DEF theory with welltimed binary pulsars. Utilizing five NS-white dwarf and three NS-NS binaries, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the DEF theory up to now. Our work provides a public tool for quick evaluation of NSs' derived parameters to test gravity in the strong-field regime.

I. INTRODUCTION
Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity (GR) [1] remains the most accurate theory of gravity for more than a century. This elegant theory has passed all tests with flying colors from, e.g., the Solar System experiments [2], cosmological observation [3], the timing of binary pulsars [4­6], and gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) [7­10] and binary neutron stars (BNSs) [11­ 13]. From the Earth up to the Universe, from weak to strong gravitational field, GR remains the gold standard.
There are good theoretical reasons to go beyond GR, however [14]. Therefore, even with the success of GR, considerable efforts are still being made for alternative theories of gravity (see Refs. [2, 15] for a review). In GR, gravity is mediated solely by a massless, spin-2 tensor field, namely the metric of spacetime gµ. Differently from GR, scalartensor theories of gravity, as natural alternatives, add one or more extra scalar degrees of freedom in the gravitational sector. They not only arise naturally as a possible low-energy limit of higher dimensional theories, such as Kaluza-Klein theory [16, 17] and string theories [18], but also have a potential connection to the inflation, the dark energy, and a yet unknown unified theory of quantum gravity [3]. Originally suggested by Scherrer in 1941 [19], the most popular scalartensor gravity theories are developed in a modern framework by Jordan [20, 21], Fierz [22], Brans and Dicke [23] (JFBD; see a review in Ref. [18]). JFBD-like theories, as metric theories of gravity, do not violate the weak equivalence principle but the strong equivalence principle (SEP) due to the nonminimally coupled scalar field in the Einstein-Hilbert ac-

tion [6, 15]. Tests of SEP, which is the heart of GR, provide a powerful tool to experimentally constrain these theories.
In this paper, we restrict our attention to a class of special JFBD-like gravity formulated by Damour and Esposito-Fare`se (DEF) [24­26], where prominent violations of the SEP due to nonperturbative strong-field effects are known to arise. The DEF theory can pass present weak-field gravitational tests, such as the Cassini experiment [27], but exhibits very significant strong-field deviations away from GR in the systems involving strongly self-gravitating neutron stars (NSs) [25, 28].
In the weak-field regime, scalar-tensor theories have been extensively investigated, mostly from experiments in the Solar System, like the Cassini probe and other space missions [27]. In the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) framework, it is confirmed to a high precision  10-5 for the EddingtonRobertson-Schiff parameters [15], indicating that the DEF theory is compatible with the weak-field tests when its weakfield coupling parameter, 0, is small.
However, in the strong-field regime for the DEF theory, one kind of nonperturbative strong-field effects, the so-called spontaneous scalarization, occurs as a scalar analogue of the phase transition in ferromagnetism [25, 26, 29]. It naturally arises in an isolated compact star such as a NS under a certain condition with the scalar field excited far above its background value. Such deviation from GR introduces considerable modifications into the properties of scalarized compact stars. It also affects the relativistic orbital motion if a scalarized NS is in a binary, via, e.g., a body-dependent effective gravitational constant, extra gravitational binding energy related to the scalar field, and dipolar radiation in addition to the canonical quadrupolar radiation in GR [24, 30]. Long-term monitoring of binary pulsars and transient observations of GWs from BNS coalescences are therefore powerful tools to probe the contribution from spontaneous scalarization in extreme environments of strong gravitational fields [5, 26, 31].
The high-precision timing of binary pulsars provides some

2

of the tightest gravity tests with strongly self-gravitating bodies in the quasi-stationary strong-field gravity regime [4­ 6, 32]. In this regime, gravitational fields are strong with large spacetime curvature in the vicinity of the NSs while the typical velocity v is much smaller than the speed of light c with a ratio of v/c  10-3. To extract the information from pulsar timing for testing gravity theories, the parametrized post-Keplerian (PPK) formalism was developed as a generic pulsar timing model [33]. The dynamical information can be obtained from the pulsar timing and pulse-structure data by fitting the data to a model consisting of a set of theory-independent Keplerian and post-Keplerian timing parameters. The PPK formalism is a powerful tool and makes it possible to provide constraints on a variety of alternative gravity theories.
In the DEF theory, one of the PPK parameters, Pb, which is related to binary orbital decay, is modified due to the extra dipolar radiation [24]. The dipolar contribution, corresponding to a -1 post-Newtonian (PN) correction,1 may dominate the radiation when v/c is small. Thus, at the early time of the binary system, due to a small v/c  10-3, this mechanism enhances the energy flux of GWs emitted from the system and thus changes Pb in a noticeable way. In addition, the DEF theory predicts that, due to the spontaneous scalarization, all the PPK parameters are modified from the GR prediction [33], thus these parameters can be combined to constrain the DEF theory [26].
With the detection of GW events, especially coalescing BNSs, GW170817 [11] and a possible candidate GW190425 [34] up to date, we have a new testbed in probing the strong-field gravity. In the late inspiral stage, the spacetime of BNSs is strongly curved and highly dynamical in the vicinity of NSs, providing a powerful laboratory in the highly dynamical strong-field regime. Matched-filter analyses, used in parameter estimation of GWs [35], are sensitive to GW phase evolution, which is modified in the DEF theory and can be distinguished from GR. Thus, GW signals can also be utilized to bound the DEF theory.
So far, however, limited by the sensitivity of the LIGO/Virgo detectors below tens of hertz, the bound on dipolar radiation from GW170817 is still looser than that from the timing of binary pulsars [28, 36], since dipolar radiation corresponds to a -1 PN correction and plays a relatively important role when v/c 1. Future ground-based and space-based GW detectors with a better low-frequency sensitivity, such as Cosmic Explorer (CE) [37], Einstein Telescope (ET) [38], DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) [39] and Decihertz Observatory (DO) [40, 41] will place tighter constraints on gravity theories by either extending the sensitivity bands to be below 10 Hz or increasing the sensitivity further (see e.g. Ref. [42]).
To perform tests on the scalar-tensor gravity, first, one must derive the relevant predictions on observations precisely. The predictions on some properties of a NS, such as its radius R,
1 We refer a correction at n PN order to O(v2n/c2n) modification relative to the Newtonian order. For GWs, the quadrupolar radiation is denoted as 0 PN, and the dipolar radiation is at -1 PN.

mass mA, moment of inertia IA, and the scalar coupling parameter A, are derived by numerically integrating the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (mTOV) equations of a slowly rotating NS with the shooting method [25, 26]. This integration depends on the equation of state (EOS) of NS matters, which is still full of large uncertainties (see e.g. Refs. [43, 44]).
Apart from the NSs' properties above, many PPK parameters in binary pulsars, such as the periastron advance rate and Einstein delay parameter, require other derived properties of NSs in the DEF theory. They consist of the coupling parameters A and kA, which are predicted by calculating the derivatives of scalar coupling A and moment of inertia IA, with respect to the scalar field at infinity [26]. Note that the calculations of A and kA should be performed for a fixed value of baryonic mass m¯ A. This procedure requires the shooting method for both m¯ A and the scalar field simultaneously [26]. The calculations for such parameters are very time-consuming and thus expensive for large-scale computation.
In practice, to constrain the free parameters in the DEF theory with the well-timed pulsars in a statistically sound way, we use Bayesian inference through Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. This approach requires the evaluation of the likelihood function hundreds of thousands to millions of times. Each step of MCMC simulation requires the corresponding NS properties derived from the integration of the mTOV equations with the shooting method. The whole simulation is thus time-consuming and expensive. Such computationally intensive studies have been conducted in Ref. [28] for the first time.
In this study, instead of solving the mTOV equation iteratively and repeatedly by trial and error, we build a reducedorder surrogate model (ROM) to predict NS properties. The surrogate model is very quick by a linear algebraic operation rather than the iterative integration. Following the earlier work of Zhao et al. [36], we extend our model to predict all the PPK parameters, not just the orbital period decay parameter Pb. To explore EOS-dependent aspects, in this work, we choose 15 EOSs that are all consistent with the maximum mass of NSs being larger than 2 M . This extends the number of EOSs in Ref. [36]. We use the central matter density c of a NS to predict its radius R, mass mA, moment of inertia IA and its derivative kA, as well as the effective scalar coupling A and its derivative A. Our models are at  1% level of accuracy. According to our performance tests, one can speed up the calculations by at least two and even three orders of magnitude for the coupling parameters A and kA, and yet still keep the due accuracy. We demonstrate various applications with binary pulsars to illustrate the practical value of our ROMs.
The improvements of this work include the followings.
(I) We use a larger set of EOSs.
(II) We calculate the mTOV equation to build ROMs in the DEF theory for slowly rotating NSs, instead of the nonrotating ones, to predict the moment of inertia and its derivative.
(III) We extend our ROMs to the coupling parameters by calculating the derivatives of A and IA, and thus we can

3

predict all the PPK parameters with new ROMs.
(IV) Our ROMs speed up the calculation by two to even three orders of magnitude.
(V) We utilize the binary pulsars including double NSs to derive tight constraints on the DEF theory.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly reviews the nonperturbative spontaneous-scalarization phenomena for slowly rotating NSs. The modifications of orbital period decay, periastron advance rate, and Einstein delay parameter in the DEF gravity are discussed. In Sec. III, we analyze the difficulties in solving the mTOV equations and calculating the derived parameters for large-scale calculations. We develop a better numerical method and code it in the pySTGROMX (a.k.a. pySTGROM eXtension) package which is public for easy use for the community.2 In Sec. IV, with the speedup from pySTGROMX, we constrain the DEF theory tightly by combining the relevant PPK parameters available from observations of five NS-white dwarf (WD) systems and three NS-NS systems. Discussions and conclusions are given in Sec. V.

II. SPONTANEOUS SCALARIZATION IN THE DEF THEORY

The DEF theory is defined by the following general action in the Einstein frame [25, 26],

Here, G denotes the bare gravitational constant, g  det gµ is the determinant of "Einstein metric" gµ, R is the Ricci curvature scalar of gµ, and  is a dynamical scalar field. In the last term of Eq. (1), m denotes matter fields collectively, and the conformal coupling factor A() describes how  couples
to m in the Einstein frame. We assume that the potential, V(), is a slowly varying function at the typical scale of the
system we consider and set V() = 0 in our calculation for
simplicity (see Refs. [45, 46] for a massive scalar field).
Varying the action (1) yields the field equations,

which indicates the coupling strength between the scalar field and matters [see Eq. (3)].
In the DEF theory [26], ln A() is designated as

(5)

Then () =  ln A()/ = 0. We denote 0  00, where 0 is the asymptotic scalar field value of  at spatial infinity. Note that we have 0 = 0 = 0 in GR.
For NSs, nonperturbative scalarization phenomena develop

Generally, a more negative 0 means more manifest spontaneous scalarization in the strong-field regime. In such case, the effective scalar coupling for a NS "A" with a total massenergy of mA is

which measures the effective coupling strength between the

Now we consider a scalarized NS in a binary system in the
DEF theory. For a binary pulsar system with the pulsar labeled "A" and its companion labeled "B", the parameters A and B contribute to the secular change of the orbital period [26]. In this work, we investigate two contributions to Pb, the dipolar contribution, Pdbipole, and the quadrupolar contribution, Pqbuad. They are defined by [26]

Here the bare gravitational constant in Eq. (8), G , is obtained with the Newtonian constant GN by G = GN/(1 + 20) [24], owing to the weak field coupling. The body-dependent ef-
fective gravitational constant in Eq. (9), GAB, is given by GAB  G (1 + AB). The quadrupolar contribution Pqbuad is close to the prediction of GR with a negligible correction, while the dipolar contribution Pdbipole is the dominant additional contribution in the DEF theory. Other subleading con-
tributions induced by the scalar field can be neglected in this study [see Eq. (6.52) of Ref. [24]]. Note that the effective
scalar coupling is zero for BHs in the DEF theory due to the no-hair theorem [8, 14] and approaches to 0 for WDs in the weak field. Thus, considering Eq. (8), the contribution

4

of dipolar radiation to Pb plays an important role in NS-WD, NS-BH, and asymmetric NS-NS binaries. In those binaries, there could be a large difference between A and B.
Similarly to A, we define

For the (almost) symmetric double NS systems, such as the
double pulsar PSR J0737-3039 [48], because of the similar binary masses, A is very close to B, leading to a tiny effect from the dipolar radiation. Thus, it could be difficult to constrain the DEF theory solely by the PPK parameter Pb, unless Pb is extremely well measured. For these systems, instead of Pb, the PPK parameters  and  can be used of to provide better constraints, especially when both of the NSs develop
spontaneous scalarization.

III. EXTENDED ROM MODELS
A. Solving the mTOV equations
We here turn our attention to deriving the quantities of NSs in the strong field. For a specific EOS, given the initial conditions, namely the central matter density c and the central scalar field c, one can integrate the mTOV equations to obtain the solution of a slowly rotating NS. To derive the prediction of a DEF theory (namely, with fixed 0, 0), one varies the initial condition c iteratively with the "shooting

FIG. 1. Mass-radius relations of NSs for the 15 EOSs that we adopt
in this study. The mass-radius relations are derived from GR (dashed lines) and from a DEF theory with log10 |0| = -5.0 and 0 = -4.5 (solid lines). The massive pulsar mass from PSR J0740+6620 [49]

method" until the boundary solution matches the desired value of 0 = 0/0. Thus, given parameter set (0, 0, c), one can solve the mTOV equation by the shooting method to obtain the
macroscopic quantities of a NS (see Ref. [26] for details). The
quantities contain the NS radius R, the gravitational mass mA, the baryonic mass m¯ A, the effective scalar coupling A, and the moment of inertia IA. In this way, we have a comprehensive description of the spontaneous scalarization. In Fig. 1,
we show mass-radius relation of NSs in a DEF theory with log10 |0| = -5.0 and 0 = -4.5 for 15 EOSs we adopt in this study. It indicates clearly that the spontaneous scalarization
phenomena develop for NSs with certain masses, and larger
radii are predicted in this range.
However, to determine the coupling parameters A and kA, we have to calculate the derivatives with respect to the scalar field 0 from Eqs. (12) and (14) for a fixed form of the conformal coupling factor A() (i.e., with a fixed 0) and a fixed baryonic mass m¯ A. Calculations with different 0's (or equivalently, different 0's) but the same 0 and m¯ A are required. For a single run, the calculation is generally performed by applying the shooting method for both 0 and m¯ A with trial and error [26]. Therefore, obtaining A and kA is usually very time-consuming, especially for a large-scale calculation. In
this study, since we investigate the phenomena in the whole
parameter space of interest, we calculate the relevant deriva-
tives on a grid covering the region to avoid wasteful repetition.
In practice, for each EOS, we choose the range of c so that mA  (1 M , mmA ax) with the EOS-dependent maximum NS mass mmA ax. We set an uneven spacing of c in this range. The spacing of c samples is smaller in the range where the coupling parameters A, A and kA are rapidly changing. The number of samples in c, namely Nc , varies from  300 to  500, depending on the specific EOS. Then we generate an

spacecraft [27], and 0 -4.0 corresponds to values where spontaneous scalarization happens in the DEF theory. As a result, we have N0 × N0 = 57 × 101 = 5757 available nodes for constructing ROMs.
We have to point out that in practice it is difficult to calcu-
late kA when the scalar field is weak. In this case, a change in IA due to the weak scalar field is comparable to the random noises induced by shooting method in solving the mTOV
equations. Therefore, it is hard to keep the calculation of kA accuracy. Here we adopt an approximation that kA  0 when the spontaneous scalarization is not excited [26]. Under this assumption, for a fixed 0, we have kA  0 and
ln IA - ln IAGR  20. Thus, we choose a slightly large differential step and calculate

to reduce the influence of numerical noises. In addition, there are some unexpected glitches in the results of derivatives. We remove these glitches and perform interpolation with the nearby values instead.

N0 × N0 = 69 × 101 = 6969. We calculate the coupling parameters A and kA on each point with a reasonable differ-
ential step. Specifically, for each point (0, 0, c), we carefully select backward step (01) and forward step (02). Thus, we have (01) = 0 - (01) and (02) = 0 + (02), or equivalently, (01) and (02). Then we select points (01), 0, (c1) and
(02), 0, (c2) , where (c1) and (c2) are chosen so that m¯ A can be fixed to the value of m¯ A at the point (0, 0, c). By interpolating the samples, we obtain the values (A1), (A2), IA(1), and IA(2) at these two points. Then we calculate A and kA numerically

Finally, we make use of the data of log10 |0|  [-5.3, -2.5], instead of log10 |0|  [-5.6, -2.2], for the further calculation to avoid the inaccuracy of derivatives at boundaries (see
the region between the two red lines in Fig. 2). The boundary value 0  10-2.5 is the upper limit given by the Cassini

B. Constructing ROMs for the DEF theory

To overcome the general time-consuming computation of
the mTOV integration with the shooting method, we build ROMs for the DEF theory to improve the efficiency [36, 50]. In brief, to generate a ROM for a curve h(t; ) with parameters , one provides a training space of data V  {h(t; i)} on a given grid of parameters. In this space, one can define a "special" inner product h(·; ), h(·; ) with an inherited norm ||h(·; )||  h(·; ), h(·; ) . Then one selects a certain number (denoted as m) of basis as a chosen space RV = {ei}mi=1 with the reduced basis (RB) method. In practice, given the starting RB (i = 0), one iteratively seeks for m orthonormal RBs by iterating the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization algo-
rithm with greedy selection to minimize the maximum pro-
jection error,

i  max ||h(·; ) - Pih(·; )||2 ,

where P describes the projection of h(t; ) onto the span of the first i RBs. The process terminates when m-1 , a user-specified error bound. Then every curve in the training
space is well approximated by

where ci() is the coefficient to be used for the ROM. After the RBs are built, one selects m samples {ti}mi=1 as empirical nodes with empirical interpolation method [51]. Finally, at
each empirical node, one performs a fit to the parameter space,
{i}, and completes the construction of ROM. More details can be found in Ref. [36].

FIG. 3. Illustration of spontaneous scalarization in the DEF gravity and the numerically pathological phenomena that occur when integrating
the mTOV equations for the EOS AP4. The calculation assumes DEF theories with log10 |0| = -5.3 and 0 = -4.8 (solid lines), -4.5 (dashed lines) and -4.0 (dotted lines). For log10 |0| = -5.3, the scalar field is weak for 0 = -4.0, strong for 0 = -4.5, and this causes remarkable pathological phenomena for 0 = -4.8. The red lines mark the pathological region. In this region, A and kA are positive, instead of negative
values as in most cases.

Extending the work of Zhao et al. [36], we build ROMs for six parameters, R, mA, IA, A, A, and kA, as functions of the central matter density c, with specialized parameters  = (0, 0). We choose the implicit parameter c as an independent variable to avoid the multivalued relations between mA and R, as well as A and IA [36]. In Fig. 3, we show the relations of the parameters and illustrate the multivalued phenomena. When 0 -4.6, the A-mA and IA-mA curves are bent backwards, leading to multiple values of A and IA for a given mA. This region is marked in red in Fig. 3. The multivalued relations vanish when we use the central matter density c as an independent variable. In the red region, A and kA are not negative as normal, but rather positive due to the multivalued relations. Values of A, A, and kA span several orders of magnitude. In practice, we use ln |IA|, ln |A|, ln |A|, and ln |k0 - kA|, instead of IA, A, A, and kA, for a better numerical performance, where k0 is an EOS-dependent constant set by hand to avoid negative values of -kA in the weak scalar field regime (see Fig. 3). We have k0 0.2 generally. The training space is set to
V = log10 |0|, 0  [-5.3, -2.5] × [-4.8, -4.0] , (21)
corresponding to the region between the two red lines shown in Fig. 2. As mentioned earlier, in total we have N0 × N0 =

57 × 101 = 5757 available nodes for building ROMs.
To balance the computation cost and the accuracy of ROMs, we set the error bound  = 10-7 for mA, R, and IA,  = 10-5 for A, and  = 10-4 for A and kA. The relative projection error ~i  i/0 as a function of the basis size is shown in Fig. 4. To achieve the desired projection error, the basis size is  20­40 for mA, R, and IA, but  150­200 for A, A, and kA. It means that more RBs are essential to keep the accuracy of A, A, and kA. Note that the training space contains  6000 curves. It implies that, to achieve a certain precision (as given by our 's), the curves may exhibit redundancy in the parameter space, i.e., the amount of information necessary to characterize the relations in the DEF theory to a certain desired precision is smaller than anticipated. Our ROM extracts  1% of the data but captures the essential information and retains the original predictions of the DEF theory to sufficient precision. The precision loss in ROM building is negligible, considering the tolerable error ( 1%) involved in the shooting method and the calculation of derivatives. This is also verified in assessing the accuracy of the ROMs below. Eventually we perform the fits and complete the construction of the six ROMs (i.e., for R, mA, IA, A, A, and kA) for each of the 15 EOSs. We encapsulate those six ROMs for the DEF theory in the pySTGROMX package for community use.

operations in the ROMs. Note that traditionally calculating A and kA involves applying shooting method for both 0 and m¯ A. The time is usually tens of seconds for generating one point in such calculation. Thus, our method improves the speed of calculating A and kA by at least three orders of magnitude.
To assess the accuracy of the ROMs, we define

(X) =

XROM - XmTOV XROM + XmTOV

,

(22)

where X  {mA, R, IA, A, A, kA}, to indicate the fractional accuracy of the ROMs. In Eq. (22), we denote XROM as the prediction of ROM, and XmTOV as the value from solving the mTOV equations with the shooting algorithm. The values XmTOV in the test space should also be calculated at different samples but with the same method to avoid the extra error induced by the use of different methods. Thus, instead of randomly generating parameters, we set another grid as the test space which is shifted from the training space for 0, 0, and c, and calculate the parameters in the same way. The test space has the sparser distribution of 0. Note that in this method we include all errors for our ROMs, including the in-
terpolating errors.
The distributions of (X) are shown in Fig. 5. The relative errors of mA, R, and IA are 10-5. On the contrary, relative errors of A, A, and kA are mostly smaller than 1%. Although their errors are larger than those of R, mA, and IA, the errors are, in most cases, still small enough to be neglected compared
with the numerical errors from the shooting method. For kA, in some cases the change of IA is rather small, as we have mentioned in Sec. III A, leading to a relatively large numerical
error when calculating the derivatives. Thus, a small fraction
of prediction for kA in our ROM has a seemingly large error in the range  1­10%. However, we find that in such case
we have kA 1, thus the deviation in this region has little influence on our study and will not have a practical effect.

errors are negligible in most practical cases.

We test the performance of the ROMs with randomly generated parameter sets (0, 0, c) on our Intel Xeon E5-2697A V4 computers. We find that the averaged time for
generating the parameters improves from  1 second by solv-
ing the mTOV equations to  1 millisecond (for mA, R, and IA) and  3 milliseconds (for A, A, and kA) by linear algebraic

IV. CONSTRAINTS FROM BINARY PULSARS
Constraints on the DEF parameters, 0 and 0, have been investigated from various gravitational systems. In the Solar System, the Cassini mission [27] gives a limit on 0, |0| < 3.4 × 10-3 at 68% confidence level (CL), from the measurement of Shapiro delay in the weak-field regime. In the strongfield regime, timing of binary pulsars provides the most stringent constraints so far to the DEF theory [26, 28, 31, 52, 57]. Here we extend the analysis in Refs. [28, 36], by carefully selecting more systems and constraining the DEF parameters in a numerically faster and reliable way with the ROMs we built in Sec. III. We will employ the MCMC technique [28, 65] to derive constraints when combining the timing observations from binary pulsar systems, including NS-WD and NS-NS systems. We will also discuss the improvements on deriving NS properties and the constraints on the DEF parameters.

A. Setup
Previous work [28, 36] has constrained the spontaneous scalarization of the DEF theory via MCMC simulations by combining some well-timed binary pulsars. These previous studies considered five well-timed NS-WD binary pulsars, PSRs J0348+0432 [52], J1012+5307 [53­56], J1738+0333 [57], J1909-3744 [58], and J2222-0137 [59]. We include these five systems in our study as well and their latest relevant parameters are listed in Table I. For these systems, WD companions are weakly self-gravitating objects, leading to a tiny effective scalar coupling B  0. It indicates a large dipolar contribution  (A - 0)2 to Pb, if A is sufficiently different from 0 [see Eq. (8)]. As explained in the caption of Table I, the measurements of the masses are independent of the PPK parameter Pb. Thus, we can safely place bounds on the parameters of the DEF theory by utilizing these masses and the intrinsic orbital decay rate, Pibnt.
Apart from the five NS-WD systems, we add three NS-NS systems in our study. As discussed above, due to the closeness of A and B, the dipolar radiation of these (almost) symmetric double NS systems is small, making it difficult to constrain the DEF theory with Pb. However, as shown in Sec. II, some other PPK parameters derived from pulsar timing, such as the

periastron advance rate  and the Einstein delay parameter , are also modified in the DEF theory. These modifications are considerable, especially for NS-NS binaries. Therefore, these double NS systems are potentially powerful laboratories to constrain the free parameters of the DEF theory. In Table II, we show parameters of three well-timed double NSs used in this study: PSRs B1913+16 [63], J0737-3039A [48], and J1757-1854 [64]. In these systems, the measurements of the masses depend on PPK parameters. For PSR B1913+16, the masses are determined from measurement of periastron advance,  , and Einstein delay, . For PSR J0737-3039, the masses are determined from the measurement of  and theory-independent mass ratio q. For PSR J1757-1854, the masses are determined from the DDGR model [66, 67], which includes the contribution from all PPK parameters via their GR formats. In principle, only the independent subset of PPK parameters that were not used in deriving masses can be utilized to constrain the DEF parameters.
To obtain NSs' properties, we need to assume a particular EOS. In this study, as mentioned earlier, we adopt 15 EOSs, namely AP3, AP4, BL EOS, BSk20, BSk21, BSk22, BSk25, ENG, MPA1, PAL1, SLy4, SLy9, SLy230a, WFF1, and WFF2 (see Ref. [68] for a review). The mass-radius relations from these EOSs are shown in Fig. 1. These EOSs are

all consistent with the observed 2 M maximum mass limit of NSs, and they are chosen inclined towards those which predict NS radii around  11­13 km, as favored by the tidal deformability measurement in GW170817 [11, 69].
B. Constraints from individual pulsars
Before the MCMC simulations, we can estimate the constraints on the DEF parameters, 0 and 0, from individual binary systems. We saturate the uncertainties on individual PPK parameters to determine the upper limits of the DEF parameters. By determining if the predicted value Ptbh from Eqs. (8) and (9) lies within the 1- range of Pibnt, i.e., Pibnt ± Pibnt, we obtain the limits on the difference of effective scalar couplings A and B, i.e. || = |A - B|. With it, we constrain parameters 0 and 0.
In Fig. 6, we show the constraints on 0 and 0 obtained from binary pulsars. In these systems, PSR J1738+0333 gives almost the most stringent constraint. The upper limit of 0 can reach  -4.4 from PSRs J1012+5307 and J2222-0137. When 0 is around -3 to -2, the constraints from binary pulsars are weak, leading to a peak of |0|. However, the limit from the Cassini mission helps exclude this region. In Fig. 7, we show constraints from hypothetical asymmetric BNS merger events at 200 Mpc, to be probed by GW detectors including Advanced LIGO (aLIGO), CE, and ET [28]. We assume two hypothetical BNSs with masses, (1.25 M , 1.6 M ) and (1.25 M , 2.0 M ), and the limits are obtained from Fisher information matrix [35]. It is shown that the GW detectors could help in constraining the DEF parameters if such BNSs are observed. Among the three detectors, ET would probably provide tighter bounds, due to its lower starting frequency. Note that these constraints are dependent on the specific EOS, and in Figs. 6 and 7 we have assumed EOS AP4. The results are similar to previous results in Refs. [28, 57].

The dashed lines represent the constraints from a (1.25 M , 1.6 M ) BNS merger event, and the dotted lines correspond to a (1.25 M , 2.0 M ) event. The shaded area is an illustration for combining all these constraints. We plot the limits from PSR J1738+0333 and the Cassini mission for comparison.

We here explore the constraints on the DEF theory combining the well-timed binary pulsars through MCMC simulations. MCMC technique provides a convenient and statistically sound algorithm to generate the distribution of unknown parameters for a model with many free parameters. In this study, we use EMCEE,3 a python implementation of an affineinvariant MCMC ensemble sampler, and our pySTGROMX package to speed up the calculation within the Bayesian framework.

The intrinsic orbital decay Pibnt, the periastron advance rate  obs, the Einstein delay parameter obs, the pulsar mass moAbs, and the companion mass moBbs are given in Tables I and II. The 1- uncertainty, X, is the observational uncertainty for parameter X, where
X  P ibnt,  obs, obs, moAbs, moBbs . The parameters, P b,  , , and mA are dependent on the parameter set, (0, 0, ). The
companion mass mB is consistently given from the parameter
set (0, 0, ) as well when it is a NS. Otherwise, for a WD, it is picked randomly within the 1- uncertainty of moBbs.
For WD companions, the coupling parameters can be re-
duced to B = 0 and B = 0. Thus, their contributions to  and  can be neglected. In addition to the five NS-WD

binary pulsars that have been investigated in Refs. [28, 36],

we combine three extra double NS systems. In these NS-NS systems, we could utilize the information from  and . However, not each pulsar's measurements of  , , mA, and mB are independent, as we have mentioned above. Thus, only for some suitable pulsar systems, the contributions of  and  are

counted in a consistent way. In this study, we combine the contributions from Pibnt of eight binary pulsars and  of PSR J0737-3039A in total for our estimation. In this way, we uti-

lize the available information from the timing data as much as

possible.

Note that the other parameters included in MCMC calcu-

lations, such as the orbital period, Pb, and the orbital eccentricity, e, are determined very well from the observations (see

Tables I and II). Thus, we adopt their central values for simplicity in the process of MCMC calculations, which is suffi-

cient in the context.

Now, we describe the details of employing the MCMC technique to get the posteriors from the priors on (0, 0) and the log-likelihood function (25). In the MCMC calculation, the information we utilize to constrain the parameter space of (0, 0) is from the NSs. In total, we have N = NNS-WD + 2NNS-NS NSs from the observations. To describe the observational signatures fully in the DEF theory, we need N + 2 free parameters, collectively denoted as  = 0, 0, c(i) (i = 1, 2, ..., N) where (ci) is the central matter density of NS i in the Jordan frame. The initial values of (ci) are sampled around their GR values. We allow the simulation to explore a large region of central matter density. Thanks to our ROMs, the initial central values of the scalar field c are no longer needed during the calculation, which avoids extra computationally intensive calculations [28]. Using 0, 0, and (ci), we obtain the properties of NSs. Then we calculate the PPK parameters and the log-likelihood functions to evaluate the posteriors.
For our studies, we carefully choose the priors of (0, 0) to cover the region of interest where the spontaneous scalarization develops. For each MCMC run, we assume a uniform prior distribution of log10 |0|, 0 in the region of our ROMs, i.e., log10 |0|, 0  [-5.3, -2.5] × [-4.8, -4.0].
For each MCMC simulation, we use 32 walkers (chains) and 100,000 steps for each walker. Thus, we produce 3.2 million samples in total. The first half chain samples are discarded as the BURN-IN phase [65, 71]. Then we "thin" the remaining samples, with a thinning factor of ten, to reduce the correlation of the adjacent samples. We perform the GelmanRubin test for convergence, and we have confirmed that our samples pass the test [71]. Thus, our posteriors of 0 and 0 are statistically reliable. We end up with 1.6 × 105 "thinned" samples for each simulation to infer the marginalized distributions of the free parameters 0 and 0. Eventually, we apply this procedure to all the 15 EOSs.
D. Constraints from combining binary pulsars
In this subsection, we show the constraints from the timing measurements of binary pulsars from the application of our ROMs. To achieve the speedups of MCMC calculations, we restrict the priors of log10 |0| and 0 to the same ranges as in our ROMs. With the MCMC simulations done, we can obtain the posterior distributions of the DEF parameters log10 |0| and 0 for the 15 EOSs we adopt.
In Fig. 8, as an example, we show the marginalized 2dimensional (2-d) and 1-d posterior distributions in the parameter space of log10 |0|, -0 and the constraints at 68% and 90% CLs for EOS AP4. As mentioned above, the priors of log10 |0|, -0 are uniform distributions in the rectangle region of Fig. 8. The results from pulsars provide very tight constraints on the parameters of the DEF theory. The upper limits of log10 |0| and -0 are constrained to  -3.9 and  4.3 at 90% CL, respectively. The constraints are overall similar to previous results from Refs. [28, 36]. The extra double NS systems provide certain but not remarkable improvements in our results. The tight constraints are mainly contributed by

the dipolar radiation in the NS-WD systems. Here, we mainly
aim to provide a test that proves the ability of our method to
constrain these parameters. In the future, with the further precise observations of binary pulsars, the PPK parameters  and  might provide additional constraints for the DEF gravity.
We apply the analysis above to all the 15 EOSs. The
marginalized 2-d and 1-d distributions from the MCMC re-
sults for all the 15 EOSs we include in this study are shown
in Fig. 9. In addition, in Fig. 10 we show the 1-d distributions of log10 |0| and -0, and their upper bounds at 68% and 90% CLs for all the EOSs. These results are overall similar,
but show the dependence on the choice of EOS. The upper bounds on 0 at 90% CL are approximately 10-4. The upper bounds on -0 at 90% CL are  4.3.
Using our ROMs, we can conveniently discuss the spon-
taneous scalarization phenomena of a NS. In Fig. 11, we il-
lustrate the upper bounds at 90% CL on the absolute values of coupling parameters: effective scalar coupling A and its derivative, A, as well as coupling factor for the moment of inertial, kA, as functions of the NS mass, mA. The ranges below the curves mark the regions that are unconstrained up to now.
It is shown clearly that, for all the 15 EOSs, the allowed maxi-
mum values of these parameters are constrained tightly. In left
panel of Fig. 11, the upper bounds at 90% CL on the NSs show that for some EOSs, the maximal effective scalar coupling allowed is  10-2. A remarkable scalarization of NS at this
level is still permitted for a NS with a suitable mass within the range of 1.6­2.0 M . Compared with earlier results [28, 36],
the "scalarization window" is still open though slightly lim-
ited further. An improvement in this study is that, besides the scalar coupling A, we can investigate the coupling parame-

ters A and kA conveniently with our ROMs. As shown in the middle and right panels of Fig. 11, the peaks with extremely large values of A and kA shown in Fig. 3 due to the fact of strong scalarization are essentially ruled out. Only mild deviation is permitted now. The maximum values are  3 × 102 for |A| and  10 for |kA|. Therefore, a very large deviation of these scalar coupling parameters from GR is not expected based on the contemporary observation. However, there is still some room for a noteworthy spontaneous scalarization.
Combining the results, we note that for a stiffer EOS, spontaneous scalarization tends to be significant for larger mass, from 1.4­1.7 M (EOS WFF1) to 1.8­2.2 M (EOS PAL1). Most of the NS masses in our study lie in mA  1.3­1.7 M . As a consequence, the MCMC simulation shows that, the tightest constraint is obtained for EOS WFF1.
In a short summary, we provide a quick and statistically reliable method to constrain the DEF parameters. We verify the validity of the method and give the stringent constraints on the DEF theory. The bounds are slightly improved, but overall similar to previous studies [28, 36]. Constraints on |0| and 0 depend on the precision of the observation, choice of pulsar systems, EOSs, and priors. The "scalarization window" is still open at the level of  10-2 for all the EOSs. More observations and suitable systems in the future, such as possible observations of pulsar timing and GWs from BNSs with NS masses lying in the "scalarization window", will help to place new constraints on the DEF theory.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigate the DEF theory that predicts large deviations from GR for NSs through nonperturbative spontaneous scalarization phenomena. We briefly review the scalarization phenomena of the DEF theory and relevant predictions. To avoid solving the mTOV equations for slowly rotating NSs repeatedly, which is time-consuming and computationally expensive, we construct efficient ROMs to derive NSs' properties including mA, R, IA, A, A, and kA for the DEF theory. Based on the contemporary observations about the properties of NSs, such as masses and radii, we build ROMs for 15 carefully selected EOSs, extending earlier work. The ROMs for our calculations are coded in a python package pySTGROMX and made public for the community use. After testing the performance of the ROMs, we find that, compared with the shooting algorithm, our ROMs can speed up the relevant calculations by two orders of magnitude for A and even three orders for A and kA, and yet still keep accuracy at  1% level. This gives an accurate and more comprehensive description of NSs' properties in DEF gravity.
As an application, we utilize pySTGROMX to explore constraints on the DEF theory with well-timed binary pulsars through MCMC simulations. We use the latest precise data from five NS-WD systems and three NS-NS systems, to derive tight constraint of the DEF theory. We bound the DEF parameters to be |0| 10-3.9 and -0 4.3 at the 90% CL for a variety of EOSs. The constraints are dependent on the precision of the observation, choice of pulsar systems, priors,

and EOSs. We find that the "scalarization window" still exists at  10-2 level. In the future, if NSs whose masses lie around the "scalarization window" can be observed precisely, the possibility of a strong scalarization for NSs may be excluded entirely.
In the future, the new large radio telescopes, e.g., the Fivehundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) in

China [72] and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) in Australia and South Africa [73, 74], are expected to improve the precision of pulsar timing and also discover new pulsar systems. These would help to close the "scalarization window". Furthermore, the current and next-generation GW detectors, such as the aLIGO, CE, ET, and KAGRA, could have more detection of compact binary coalescences in the future. These

14

observations would provide more information to be used to investigate alternative theories of gravity in a more precise and accurate way. Our ROMs are constructed to satisfy the requirements of quick evaluation of the parameters in the DEF theory, suitable for applications for binary pulsar experiments, as well as GWs to some extent.
