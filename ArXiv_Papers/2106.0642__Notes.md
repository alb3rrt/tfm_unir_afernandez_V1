## Abstract

The effect of asymmetric functionally graded material on the edge resonance and the Fano resonance in semi-infinite FGM plates are reported in this work. The edge resonance is weakened by the material perturbation and the complete mode conversion is illustrated with incident $S_0$ mode. The Fano resonance occurs on the reflected $A_0$ mode as a result of interference between the resonance and direct scattering with incident $A_0$ mode. A hybrid analytical model based on the collocation discretization and the modal decomposition of the elastic field is developed to analyze the scattering properties of the semi-infinite plates. The Fano line-shape is discussed in detail. The results show that the Fano line shape is sensitive to the volume fraction, which is beneficial for the quantitative guided wave application.
