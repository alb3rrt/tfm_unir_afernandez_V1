Recently, the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators are predicted in Lithium-decorated iron-based superconductor monolayer materials (LiFeX (X=S, Se and Te)) with very high Curie temperature (PRL 125, 086401 (2020)), which combines the topological and ferromagnetic (FM) orders. It is interesting and useful to achieve coexistence of intrinsic piezoelectricity, ferromagnetism and nontrivial band topology in single two-dimensional (2D) material, namely 2D piezoelectric quantum anomalous hall insulator (PQAHI). In this work, 2D Janus monolayer Li2Fe2SSe is predict to be a room-temperature PQAHI, which possesses dynamic, mechanical and thermal stabilities. It is predicted to be a half Dirac semimetal without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It is found that the inclusion of SOC opens up a large nontrivial gap, which means the nontrivial bulk topology (QAH insulator), confirmed by the calculation of Berry curvature and the presence of two chiral edge states (Chern number C=2). Calculated results show that monolayer Li2Fe2SSe possesses robust QAH states against biaxial strain and electronic correlations. Compared to LiFeX, the glide mirror Gz of Li2Fe2SSe disappears, which will induce only out-of-plane piezoelectric response. The calculated out-of-plane d31 of monolayer Li2Fe2SSe is -0.238 pm/V comparable with ones of other 2D known materials. Moreover, very high Curie temperature (about 1000 K) is predicted by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which means that the QAH effect can be achieved at room temperature in Janus monolayer Li2Fe2SSe. Similar to monolayer Li2Fe2SSe, the PQAHI can also be realized in the Janus monolayer Li2Fe2SeTe. Our works open a new avenue in searching for PQAHI with high temperature and high Chern numbers, which provide a potential platform for multi-functional spintronic applications.

I. INTRODUCTION
The quantum Hall (QH) effect can be achieved in a 2D electron gas by a strong perpendicular external magnetic field1, while the occurrence of the QAH effect aries from SOC and time-reversal (TR) symmetry broken in the presence of magnetic order2. The QAH effect is generally confirmed by a nonzero Chern number in accordance with the number of edge states , and only one spin species are allowed to flow unidirectionally, resulting in a quantized Hall conductance3­5. The discovery of TR invariant topological insulators promotes the experimental realization of QAH effect6,7. Following the theoretical work8, the QAH effect is achieved experimentally in thin films of Cr doped (Bi, Sb)2Te below 30 mK, with quantized Hall conductance being observed9. The QAH effect achieves the coexistence of magnetism and topological electronic band structure in a single compound. It's a natural idea to combine more properties in a material, like the coexistence of QAH effect and piezoelectricity.
The piezoelectricity of 2D materials has been widely investigated in recent years10. The piezoelectricity of 2D materials has been observed experimentally11­14, and the density functional theory (DFT) calculations have also predicted the piezoelectric properties of many 2D materials15­24, which lack centrosymmetry. Recently, some 2D multifunctional piezoelectric materials have

been predicted by the first-principle calculations. In the 2D vanadium dichalcogenides, VSi2P4, CrBr1.5I1.5 and InCrTe325­28, the piezoelectric ferromagnetism (PFM) has been predicted, which combines piezoelectricity and ferromagnetism. The combination of piezoelectricity with topological insulating phase, namely piezoelectric quantum spin Hall insulator (PQSHI), has also been realized in monolayer InXO (X=Se and Te)29 and Janus monolayer SrAlGaSe430. These discoveries provide possibility for using piezoelectric effect to control the quantum or spin transport process, which may induce novel device applications or scientific breakthroughs.
In fact, in our recent work, the PQAHI has also been achieved in Janus monolayer Fe2IX (X=Cl and Br)31, based on QAH insulator Fe2I232. Recently, the lithium decoration of layered iron-based superconductor materials FeX (X=S, Se and Te), namely LiFeX, are predicted as room-temperature QAH insulators with high Chern number (C=2)33, and the guidances on experimental realization have also been discussed. The LiFeX (X=S, Se and Te) have similar crystal structure with Fe2I2, and no piezoelectricity can be observed due to inversion symmetry. A natural idea is to achieve PQAHI from LiFeX (X=S, Se and Te) monolayer by removing inversion symmetry. As an example, the monolayer FeSe has particular sandwiched structure (Se-Fe-Se), and Janus structure can be built by replacing the top Se atomic layer with S

atoms (Fe2SSe), and then apply the gating techniques to inject a large amount of Li ions into monolayer Fe2SSe (Li2Fe2SSe). The related experimental techniques have been widely used34­38.
In this work, it is found that, by first-principles calculations, Janus monolayer Li2Fe2SSe is a 2D ferromagnetic semiconductor with out-of-plane magnetization, which can achieve the QAH effect at quite high temperature. Janus monolayer Li2Fe2SSe is proved to be dynamically, mechanically and thermally stable. According to the results of Berry curvature and Chiral edge states, a high Chern number C=2 is obtained for Li2Fe2SSe. It is found that QAH effect of Li2Fe2SSe is robust against biaxial strain and electronic correlations. A very high Curie temperature of about 1000 K is estimated by MC simulations using Heisenberg model. A particular symmetry leads to only out-of-plane piezoelectric response, and the predicted out-of-plane d31 is -0.238 pm/V, which is comparable with ones of other 2D known materials. These results indicate that 2D Janus Li2Fe2SSe may be promising candidate for realizing the room-temperature PQAHI in experiments, which is very useful for developing 2D piezoelectric spin topological devices.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we shall give our computational details and methods. In the next few sections, we shall present crystal structure, structural stabilities, topological properties, strain and correlation effects on topological properties, Curie temperature and piezoelectric properties of 2D Janus Li2Fe2SSe. Finally, we shall give our discussion and conclusions.

for Janus monolayer Li2Fe2SSe. We use popular generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof43 as the exchange-correlation functional, and the SOC is included by a second variational proce-
dure on a fully self-consistent basis. The total energy convergence criterion is set for 10-8 eV with the Gaus-
sian smearing method. The force convergence criterion is set for less than 0.0001 eV.°A-1 for optimizing the lattice constants and atomic coordinates by the conjugate gradi-
ent (CG) scheme. To avoid artificial interactions caused by the periodic boundary condition, the vacuum layer is

3

set to more than 15 °A. The Fe-3d orbitals generally have important correlation effects, and the DFT+U method44
is employed for the treatment of the strongly correlated 3d electrons with Ueff = 2.5 eV32,45.
With FM ground state, the interatomic force constants
(IFCs) with the 5×5×1 supercell are calculated through
the direct supercell method. Based on harmonic IFCs,
the phonon dispersions are attained by using Phonopy code46. An effective tight-binding Hamiltonian con-
structed from the maximally localized Wannier function
(MLWF) is used to calculate the surface states and Berry
curvature with the iterative Green function method, as implemented in the package WannierTools47,48. The
Curie temperature is determined by MC simulations, as implemented by Mcsolver code49.
The elastic stiffness tensor Cij and piezoelectric stress tensor eij are carried out by using strain-stress relationship (SSR) with GGA and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) method50 using GGA+SOC. The
Brillouin zone (BZ) integration is sampled by using a
18×18×1 Monkhorst-Pack grid for the self-consistent cal-
culations and elastic coefficients Cij. A very dense mesh of 26×26×1 k-points in the BZ is adopted to attain the accurate eij. The 2D elastic coefficients Ci2jD and piezoelectric stress coefficients e2ijD have been renormalized by Ci2jD=LzCi3jD and e2ijD=Lze3ijD, where the Lz is the length of unit cell along z direction.

III. CRYSTAL STRUCTURE
The FeSe monolayer has Se-Fe-Se trilayers with a tetragonal lattice in the P 4/nmm space group, the unit cell of which contains four atoms with two co-planar Fe atoms. It is proved that the room-temperature QAH insulator can be achieved by Li decoration of FeSe monolayer33. In fact, the Fe2I2 monolayer, having the same crystal structure with FeSe, is predicted to be a QAH insulator32. The I element has one more valence electron than Se element, and the Li atom with an ultralow electronegativity easily loses one valence. So, the Li decoration of FeSe monolayer can become a QAH insulator. It is well known that Janus monolayer MoSSe (S-Mo-Se) can be constructed from MoSe2 with three atomic sublayers (Se-Mo-Se)34. In our previous work, the Janus monolayer Fe2IX (X=Cl and Br) is predicted to be PQAHI31, which is built by replacing one of two I layers with X (X=Cl and Br) atoms in monolayer Fe2I2. It is a natural idea to construct Janus Fe2SSe monolayer (S-Fe-Se) by replacing one of two Se layers with S atoms in monolayer FeSe, and then to achieve PQAHI by Li decoration of Janus monolayer Fe2SSe (Li2Fe2SSe). Compared with FeSe monolayer, the Li2Fe2SSe monolayer with P 4mm space group (No.99) lacks centrosymmetry, giving rise to piezoelectricity. The top and side views of schematic crystal structure of Janus monolayer Li2Fe2SSe are shown in Figure 1.
The ground state of Janus monolayer Li2Fe2SSe can be

determined by comparing the energy difference between

antiferromagnetic (AFM) and FM states. The magnetic

ground state of Li2Fe2SSe monolayer is FM, which can be

seen from the (c) in Figure 1. The optimized lattice con-

stants a0 is 3.636 °A with FM order, which is between ones of LiFeS (3.542 °A) and LiFeSe (3.655 °A)33. The thermal

stability of magnetic ordering can be described by the

magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE), stemming from the

SOC effect. The (100) and (001) directions are used to

obtain relative stabilities by using GGA+SOC. The en-

ergy difference of the magnetic moments constrained in

the (100) and (001) direction is 172 µeV /Fe, indicating

that the out-of-plane (001) direction is the easy one for

magnetization in monolayer Li2Fe2SSe. A built-in elec-

tric field can be produced by the the inequivalent bond

lengths and bond angles (see Table I) due to different

atomic sizes and electronegativities of S and Se atoms.

IV. STRUCTURAL STABILITY
The phonon calculation of Li2Fe2SSe (see (d) in Figure 1) reveals that there are no imaginary frequency modes, confirming its dynamic stability, which means that Li2Fe2SSe monolayer can exist as free-standing 2D crystal. A total of 18 branches due to 6 atoms per unitcell can be observed, including 15 optical and 3 acoustical phonon branches. The out-of-plane acoustic (ZA) branch (out-of-plane vibrations) deviates from linearity, in accord with the conclusion that the ZA phonon branch should have quadratic dispersion for the unstrained monolayer51,52. The thermal stability of Li2Fe2SSe monolayer is further assessed by performing ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations using NVT ensemble with a 4×4×1 supercell at 300 K. For Li2Fe2SSe monolayer, the temperature and total en-

ergy fluctuations as a function of the simulation time are shown in Figure 2. It is found that the total energy and temperature fluctuate smoothly with small amplitudes after the preheating process, which means a favorable thermal stability for Li2Fe2SSe monolayer at room tempearure.
The mechanical stability of monolayer Li2Fe2SSe can be checked by Born criteria of mechanical stability:

C11 > 0, C66 > 0, C11 - C12 > 0

(1)

where the C11, C12 and C66 are three independent elastic constants. By using Voigt notation, the elastic tensor with 4mm point-group symmetry can be reduced into:

The calculated C11, C12 and C66 are 91.26 Nm-1, 32.15 Nm-1 and 43.00 Nm-1, which satisfy the above Born cri-
teria of mechanical stability, indicating mechanical sta-
bility of monolayer Li2Fe2SSe. Due to C4 rotation symmetry, the mechanical proper-
ties of monolayer Li2Fe2SSe have C4 symmetry, and the direction-dependent in-plane Young's moduli C2D() and Poisson's ratios 2D() can be attained by53,54:

they show C4 symmetry, and we only consider the 090 angle range. The softest direction is along the (100)
direction, while the hardest direction is along the (110)
direction, and the corresponding Young's moduli is 79.94 Nm-1 and 101.36 Nm-1. The maximum value of Young's moduli is less than that of many 2D materials15,18,55,
which means that the monolayer Li2Fe2SSe has extraordinary flexibility. For Poisson's ratios, the minima is
along the (110) direction (0.179), while the maxima is
along the (100) direction (0.352).

V. TOPOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
The energy band structures of monolayer Li2Fe2SSe with GGA is plotted in Figure 3, along with atom projected band structure in Figure 4. Without SOC, monolayer Li2Fe2SSe shows a 2D half Dirac semimetal state with a large-gap insulator for spin up (1.41 eV) and a gapless Dirac semimetal for spin down. Due to C4 symmetry, the four Dirac cones in the BZ can be observed for spin

down along the mirror symmetry invariant lines -X and -Y. The important observation is that the states around the Fermi level for spin down are dominated by the Fe-d orbitals, which means that the Fe-d orbitals are partially occupied. However, the spin-up channel is fully occupied. These lead to the high-spin state for Fe atom, giving a spin magnetic moment of 3 µB. To understand the composition of Dirac cone, we project the states to five Fe-d orbitals for spin down, which are plotted in Figure 5. Calculated results show that the states around Dirac cone are dominated by the dxy and dz2 orbital. We then investigate the electronic band structures with SOC, and the energy bands are shown in Figure 3. When including SOC, the Dirac point splits apart with a noticeable energy gap opened, and the corresponding gap is 96.2 meV for Li2Fe2SSe, which suggests nontrivial topology.
When the TR symmetry of a material breaks with a finite magnetic ordering, the topologically nontrivial properties can be verified by a non-zero Chern number in the valence bands. The Chern number of monolayer Li2Fe2SSe can be attained by integrating the Berry curvature (z(k)) of the occupied bands:

C

=

1 2

d2 kz (k)
BZ

(5)

z(k) = k × i µn,k|kµn,k

(6)

in which the µn,k is the lattice periodic part of the Bloch wave functions. The distributions of Berry curvature of monolayer Li2Fe2SSe are shown in Figure 6. As can be observed, the nonzero Berry curvature is mainly distributed around four Dirac cones, and they have the same sign because of C4 symmetry. Two Berry curvature peaks contribute to the nonzero Chern number 1, and the total Chern number from the 4 Berry curvature peaks equals 2. In other words, a quantized Berry phase of  can be attained for each gapped Dirac cone, and the total Berry phase of 4 is attained (four Dirac cones), giving rise to a Chern number C=2.
Based on the bulk-edge correspondence, the non-zero Chern number can be further confirmed by the number of nontrivial chiral edge states inside the bulk gap of a semiinfinite system. The local density of states vs momentum and energy at the edge can be obtained from the imaginary part of the surface Green's function:

(7)

The topological edge states along the (100) direction are shown in Figure 6. It is clearly seen that the bulk states are connected by two chiral edge states, which indicates that Chern number equals to 2. These results show that monolayer Li2Fe2SSe is a QAH insulator.

VI. STRAIN AND CORRELATION EFFECTS
ON TOPOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
The strain generally can tune the SOC-induced bulk gap, MAE and magnetic order. It is important to investigate robustness of QAH properties of monolayer Li2Fe2SSe against biaxial strain. Here, we use a/a0 (0.961.04) to describe the biaxial strain, where a (a0) is the strained (equilibrium) lattice constants. The energy difference between FM and AFM orders and MAE as a function of a/a0 are plotted in Figure 7. It is found that all strained monolayers are FM ground state in considered strain range, and the energy difference between FM and AFM order decreases with a/a0 from 0.96 to 1.04. However, the MAE shows nonmonotonicity, which firstly increases, and then decreases. In considered strain range, the out-of-plane (001) direction is always the easy one. The energy band structures of some representa-

tive strained monolayer Li2Fe2SSe using GGA+SOC are plotted in Figure 8, and the gap as a function of strain is shown in Figure 9. It is found that the gap increases almost linearly with increasing strain in considered strain range, and the gap changes from 49.7 meV to 135.8 meV. The topological edge states of strained monolayer Li2Fe2SSe are calculated, and they all are QAH insulators with Chern number C=2. We show topological edge states at representative 1.04 strain in Figure 10, which shows clearly two chiral topologically protected gapless edge states. These results show that the QAH topological properties of monolayer Li2Fe2SSe are robust against strain.
To check the Coulomb interaction U effects on QAH properties, we calculate the energy difference between FM and AFM orders, MAE, energy bands and topological edge states with different values of U (0-4 eV). The energy difference between FM and AFM order and MAE as a function of U are plotted in Figure 7. It is found that the ground state always is FM order with different U . It is found that the MAE increases with increasing U . When the U value is larger than 0 eV, the out-of-plane (001) direction is always the easy one in considered U range. For U =0 eV, the MAE only is -0.5 µeV /Fe, and the spin orientation in the energy band calculations is chosen in the out-of-plane direction. The energy band structures of monolayer Li2Fe2SSe with some representative U value using GGA+SOC are plotted in Figure 8, and the gap as a function of U is shown in Figure 9. With increasing U , it is clearly seen that the gap increases from -4.1 meV to 257.6 meV. For U=0 eV, the monolayer Li2Fe2SSe becomes metal. In considered U range except U =0 eV, the topological edge states of monolayer Li2Fe2SSe are calculated, and they all are QAH insulators with Chern number C=2. The topological edge states at representative U =4 eV are shown in Figure 10, and two chiral topologically protected gapless edge states are present in the bulk gap. These results indicate the

A 50×50 supercell with periodic boundary conditions is employed, and 107 loops are adopted to perfotme the MC simulation. We show the normalized magnetic moment and auto-correlation of monolayer Li2Fe2SSe as a function of temperature in Figure 11. It is found that TC is as high as 996 K for monolayer Li2Fe2SSe, which is smaller than ones of Li-decorated monolayer FeX (X= S, Se and Te)33. However, the TC of monolayer Li2Fe2SSe is significantly higher than that of previously reported many 2D FM semiconductors, like CrI3 monolayer (about 45 K)56, CrOCl monolayer (about 160 K)57, Janus Fe2IX (X=Cl and Br) monolayer (about 400 K)31, Fe2I2 monolayer (about 400 K)32 and Cr2Ge2Te6 monolayer (about 20 K)58.

VII. CURIE TEMPERATURE

One of the important properties of ferromagnets for the practical application is the Curie temperatures (TC ). Using MC simulations based on the Heisenberg model, we have calculated the Curie temperature of monolayer Li2Fe2SSe. For simplicity, only the nearest neighbor (NN) exchange interaction is considered, and the spin Heisenberg Hamiltonian is defined as:

H = -J Si · Sj - A (Siz)2

(8)

i,j

i

where J, S and A are the exchange parameter, the spin vector of each atom and MAE, respectively. Based on the energy difference between AFM and FM, the magnetic coupling parameter is calculated as J=(EAF M -EF M )/8 with normalized S (|S| = 1). The calculated J value is 137.6 meV, and the A is 172 µeV /Fe.

The piezoelectric effects of a material can be described by third-rank piezoelectric stress tensor eijk and strain tensor dijk. The eijk and dijk can be expressed as:

eijk

=

Pi jk

= eeijlck

+ eiiojkn

(9)

and

dijk

=

Pi  j k

= deijlck + diiojkn

(10)

They can be related by elastic tensor Cmnjk:

eijk

=

Pi jk

=

Pi  mn

.

 mn jk

= dimnCmnjk

(11)

in which Pi, jk and jk are polarization vector, strain and stress, respectively. The eeijlck/deijlck is clamped-ion piezoelectric coefficients (only electronic contributions). The eijk/dijk is relax-ion piezoelectric coefficients as a realistic result (the sum of ionic and electronic contributions).
The Li-decorated monolayer FeX (X= S, Se and Te) are centrosymmetric, which means that they have no

However, the monolayer Li2Fe2SSe lacks glide mirror Gz symmetry, but has Mx and My mirrors symmetry, which gives only out-of-plane piezoelectricity, and the in-plane piezoelectricity will disappear. By using Voigt notation, the piezoelectric stress and strain tensors of monolayer Li2Fe2SSe can be expressed as:

The e31 can be directly calculated by VASP code, and the d31 can be derived by Equation 11, Equation 12 and Equation 13.

(14)

Next, we use the primitive cell to calculate the e31 of Janus monolayer Li2Fe2SSe. Calculated results show that the e31 is -0.294×10-10 C/m with the ionic contribution 0.133×10-10 C/m and electronic one -0.427 ×10-10 C/m. It is found that the electronic and ionic
parts have the opposite contributions, and the electronic
contribution dominates the e31. Based on Equation 14, the calculated d31 is -0.238 pm/V. The d31 of Janus monolayer Li2Fe2SSe is higher than or comparable with ones of many 2D materials59­62. The Coulomb interac-
tion U effects on piezoelectric properties of monolayer
Li2Fe2SSe are also considered. The elastic constants Cij , the piezoelectric stress coefficients (e31) and the piezoelectric strain coefficients (d31) as a function of U are plotted in Figure 12. A complex U dependence for e31 is observed, which leads to complicated U effects on d31. It is found that the smallest d31 is -0.100 pm/V with U =3 eV.

IX. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In fact, Janus monolayer Li2Fe2SeTe is also a QAH insulator. The energy difference between AFM and FM orders is 0.875 eV per unitcell, and the out-of-plane (001) direction is the easy one with MAE of 45 µeV /Fe. The calculated C11, C12 and C66 are 79.13 Nm-1, 19.06 Nm-1 and 31.36 Nm-1, which satisfy Born criteria of mechanical stability, indicating mechanical stability of monolayer Li2Fe2SeTe. The phonon spectra of Li2Fe2SeTe

is plotted in Figure 13 with no imaginary frequency modes, confirming its dynamic stability. The AIMD simulations also confirm the thermal stability of monolayer LiFe2SeTSe at room temperature. The energy band structures and topological edge states of monolayer Li2Fe2SeTe are shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14, respectively. The energy band gap is 161 meV, and the bulk states are connected by two chiral edge states, indicating Chern number C=2. The calculated d31 is 0.1 pm/V with e31 of 0.099×10-10 C/m.
In summary, using DFT+U calculations, we have per-

formed a systematic investigation of the electronic, magnetic, topological and piezoelectric properties in Janus monolayer Li2Fe2SSe, which is predicted as an intriguing 2D PQAHI. It is proved that monolayer Li2Fe2SSe is mechanically, dynamically and thermally stable. Also, the nontrivial properties are confirmed by a nonzero Chern number (C=2) and two gapless chiral edge states. Moreover, the monolayer Li2Fe2SSe possesses out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy and very high Curie temperature (about 1000 K). The emergence of QAH effect in monolayer Li2Fe2SSe is robust against strain and Hubbard U electronic correlation. The predicted d31 is comparable with ones of other 2D known materials. The predicted PQAHI in monolayer Li2Fe2SSe is expected to work safely above room temperature, and provides a more promising platform for realizing low-dissipation topotronics devices, and provides possibility to use the piezotronic effect to control QAH effects.
