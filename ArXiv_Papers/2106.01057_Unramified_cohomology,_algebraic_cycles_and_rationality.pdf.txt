1. Introduction

A variety X of dimension n over a field k is said to be rational if it is birational to

Pnk ,

that

it

for

some m  0.

Generic projection shows that any variety X of dimension n over a field k is birational

to a hypersurface {F = 0}  Pnk+1. The question whether X is rational is then equivalent to asking whether over the algebraic closure of k, almost all solutions of the equation

solutions of F = 0.

Disproving rationality for a given (rationally connected) variety X is in general a

subtle problem, which requires the computation of invariants that allow to distinguish

irrational varieties from those that are rational. Arguably the most powerful such in-

variant is unramified cohomology, which has its roots in the work of Bloch­Ogus [BO74]

and which was introduced into the subject by Colliot-Th´el`ene­Ojanguren [CTO89]. Un-

ramified cohomology is a generalization of the torsion in the third integral cohomology

of smooth complex projective varieties, respectively the (unramified) Brauer group, that

has previously been used by Artin­Mumford [AM72] and Saltman [Sal84]. It has recently

found many applications in combination with a cycle-theoretic specialization technique

that was initiated by Voisin [Voi15] and developed further by Colliot-Th´el`ene­Pirutka

[CTP16a] and the author [Sch19a, Sch19b].

The purpose of this paper is to give a detailed survey on unramified cohomlogy with a view towards its applications to rationality problems. We discuss in particular the interactions of unramified cohomology with cycles and correspondences, explain the most important known methods to construct nontrivial unramified cohomology classes in concrete examples and present the aforementioned cycle-theoretic specialization method, which in conjunction with unramified cohomology yields a powerful obstruction to (stable) rationality. In addition, we discuss some the most important functoriality and compatibility results for unramified cohomology. This includes in particular the following two results that do not seem to be recorded well in the literature: functoriality with respect to finite pushforwards (see Proposition 4.7) and compatibility of the residue map with cup products (see Lemmas 2.4 and 3.1).
Recent work of Nicaise­Shinder, Kontsevich­Tschinkel, and Nicaise­Ottem [NS19, KT19, NO19] makes the importance of semistable degenerations in the subject apparent. For this reason, we generalize in this survey Merkurjev's pairing to the case of schemes with normal crossings in Section 6 and show that it has direct consequences for the aforementioned cycle-theoretic degeneration technique, see Theorem 8.5 below.
The reader is advised to also consult the excellent survey on unramified cohomology by Colliot-Th´el`ene [CT95]. The present survey complements [CT95] with more recent developments, such as Merkurjev's pairing (see Sections 5 and 6), decompositions of the diagonal (see Section 7), the specialization method (see Section 8) and some important vanishing results (see Section 10). Moreover, some special emphasize on the computational aspect of the subject is given in Section 9. We end this survey with a few open problems in Section 11 and outline a strategy how unramified cohomology and decompositions of the diagonal may potentially be used to prove the existence of a rationally connected variety that is not unirational, see Proposition 11.8.

1.1. Notation and convention. All schemes are separated and locally Noetherian. An algebraic scheme is a scheme of finite type over a field. A variety is an integral algebraic scheme. If k is an uncountable field, a very general point of a k-variety X is a closed point outside a countable union of proper closed (algebraic) subsets. An alteration of a variety X over an algebraically closed field k is a proper generically finite morphism  : X  X such that X is smooth over k. The existence of alterations was shown by de Jong [deJ96].

2. Preliminaries from ´etale cohomology
Let k be a field. For a positive integer m that is invertible in k, we denote by µm the sheaf of m-th roots of unity. For any scheme X over k, this is a subsheaf of the multiplicative sheaf Gm of invertible functions on X and hence a sheaf in the ´etale

UNRAMIFIED COHOMOLOGY, ALGEBRAIC CYCLES AND RATIONALITY

topology of X. For an integer j  1, we consider the twists µmj := µm  · · ·  µm (j-times) and put µm0 := Z/m and µmj := Hom(µm-j, Z/m) for j < 0. If k contains all m-th roots of unity (e.g. if k is algebraically closed), then µmj  Z/m is a constant sheaf for all j.
For a scheme X and a sheaf F in the ´etale topology of X, we denote by Hi(X, F ) the
i-th ´etale cohomology of F . If X = Spec A for some ring A, then we write

Hi(A, F ) := Hi(Spec A, F ).

2.1. Cohomology of fields. Since H1(K, Gm) = 0 by Hilbert 90, the long exact sequence associated to the Kummer sequence

(2.1)

0 / µm / Gm / Gm / 0

shows that for any field K in which m is invertible, there is a canonical isomorphism

H1(K, µm)  K/(K)m,

where (K)m  K denotes the subgroup of m-th powers in K. Using this, we denote the class in H1(K, µm) that is represented by an element a  K by (a). Moreover, for a collection of elements a1, . . . , an  K, we denote by the symbol (a1, . . . , an) the class

(2.2)

(a1, . . . , an) := (a1)  (a2)  · · ·  (an)  Hn(K, µmn)

that is given by cup product. We will also need the following well-known result (see e.g. [Ser97, II.4.2]): for a variety
X over an algebraically closed field k in which m is invertible,

(2.3)

Hi(k(X), µmj) = 0 for all i > dim X.

2.2. Commutativity with direct limits. If X is a quasi-projective variety over a field k, then for any locally constant torsion ´etale sheaf F and for any point x  X, there are canonical isomorphisms

(2.4)

lim/ Hi(U, F )  Hi lim- U, F = Hi(OX,x, F ).

xU X

xU X

Here we used that in the above limit, we may restrict to the directed system of affine open

subsets U  X containing x. This guarantees that the transition maps are affine and

so the above compatibility between the direct limit of ´etale cohomology groups and the

´etale cohomology of the inverse limit of schemes holds true by [Mil80, p. 119, III.3.17],

where we use that F is locally constant. Applying (2.4) to the generic point of X, we

find in particular

(2.5)

lim/ Hi(U, F )  Hi(k(X), F ),
=U X

4

STEFAN SCHREIEDER

where the limit runs through all non-empty open subsets U of X and k(X) denotes the function field of X.

2.3. Long exact sequence of pairs.

Proposition 2.1 ([Mil80, III.1.25] or [SGA4.2, V.6.5.4]). Let V be a scheme and let Z  V be a closed subscheme with complement U. For any ´etale sheaf F on V , the pair (V, Z) gives rise to a long exact sequence

(2.6)

. . . / Hi(V, F ) / Hi(U, F |U ) / HZi+1(V, F ) / Hi+1(V, F )

where HZi (V, F ) denotes ´etale cohomology of F with support on Z.

/ ...,

Proof. Let i : Z  V and j : U  V denote the inclusions. Consider the short exact sequence
0 / j!ZU / ZV / iZZ / 0
of ´etale sheaves on V , where ZV denotes the constant sheaf on V with stalk Z, j!ZU denotes the sheaf that agrees with ZV on U and is 0 outside of U and iZZ denotes the pushforward of the constant sheaf with stalk Z on Z to V . For any ´etale sheaf F on V , applying RHom(-, F ) to the above short exact sequence, we get a long exact sequence

(2.7) ...

/ Exti(ZV , F )

/ Exti(j!ZU , F )

/ Exti+1(iZZ , F )

/ Exti+1(ZV , F )

/ ....

The long exact sequence (2.6) follows from this as there are canonical identifications

(2.8) Exti(j!ZU , F )  Hi(U, F ), Exti(ZV , F )  Hi(V, F ), Exti(iZZ , F )  HZi (V, F ),

see [Mil80, proof of III.1.25] or [SGA4.2, V.6.3].

2.4. Cup products. Let V be a scheme and recall that the abelian category Sh´et(V ) of ´etale sheaves on V has enough injectives, see e.g. [Mil80, Proposition III.1.1]. Let D = D(Sh´et(V )) be the corresponding derived category. For ´etale sheaves F and G on V , we then get canonical isomorphisms
Extj(F, G)  HomD(F, G[j]),
see e.g. [Huy06, Proposition 2.56]. Composition in the derived category thus yields for any ´etale sheaves F, G, and H on V a map
Exti(H, F )  Extj(F, G) / Exti+j(H, G).
There is a canonical map Extj(ZV , G)  Extj(F, F  G) and so for any ´etale sheaves F, G, and H on V , the above construction yields a map
Exti(H, F )  Extj(ZV , G) / Exti+j(H, F  G).

UNRAMIFIED COHOMOLOGY, ALGEBRAIC CYCLES AND RATIONALITY

Via the identifications in (2.8), any class   Hj(V, G) thus yields cup product maps

 : Hi(V, F )  Hi+j(V, F  G), |U : Hi(U, F )  Hi+j(U, F  G),

and   : HZi (V, F )  HZi+j(V, F  G). We will need the following well-known compatibility of the long exact sequence in Proposition 2.1 with the above cup product maps.

Lemma 2.2. Let V be a scheme and let Z  V be a closed subscheme with U := V \ Z. For any ´etale sheaves F and G on V and for any class   Hj(V, G), cup product with  induces a commutative diagram

Hi(V, F )

/ Hi(U, F )

/ HZi+1(V, F )



Hi+j(V, F  G)

|U

/ Hi+j(U, F  G)



/ HZi+j+1(V, F  G)

between the long exact sequences from Proposition 2.1.

/ Hi+1(V, F )


/ Hi+j+1(V, F  G)

Proof. Let   Extj(F, F  G) be the image of  via the canonical map Extj(ZV , G)  Extj(F, F  G). As explained above, we may think about  as a morphism  : F 
F  G[j] in the derived category D = D(Sh´et(V )). This morphism yields by [Huy06, Remark 12.57(ii)] a morphism between the following distinguished triangles in D:

RHom(iZZ, F )

/ RHom(ZV , F )

/ RHom(j!ZU , F )

+1
/



RHom(iZZ, F  G[j])



/ RHom(ZV , F  G[j])




/ RHom(j!ZU , F  G[j])

+1
/

The above morphism between exact triangles yields a morphism between the associated long exact sequences of cohomology groups, which by (2.8) identifies to the commutative diagram in the lemma, as we want. This concludes the proof.

2.5. Gysin sequence.

Theorem 2.3 (Gysin sequence). Let V be a regular Noetherian scheme with a regular closed subscheme Z  V of pure codimension c and complement U := V \ Z. Then for any integer m invertible on V , there is a long exact sequence
. . . / Hi(V, µmj) / Hi(U, µmj)  / Hi+1-2c(Z, µmj-c)  / Hi+1(V, µmj) / . . . .
Proof. The theorem is a well-known consequence of the long exact sequence of pairs in Proposition 2.1 together with Gabber's proof of Grothendieck's purity conjecture [Fuj02, ILO14]; we give some details for convenience of the reader.

see [SGA4.2, V.6.4]. Since Z and V are regular and Z is of pure codimension c in V ,

Grothendiecks purity conjecture, proven by Gabber (see [ILO14, XVI.3.1.1] and [Fuj02,

2.1.1]), implies

if q = 2c; else,

where i : Z  V denotes the closed immersion. Hence, the spectral sequence (2.9) degenerates at E2 and yields a canonical isomorphism:

(2.10)

H i-2c(Z, µmj-c)  / HZi (V, µmj).

Combining this with (2.6), the theorem follows.

Lemma 2.4. Let V be a regular Noetherian scheme with a regular closed subscheme
Z  V of pure codimension c and complement U := V \ Z. Let m be an integer that is invertible on V and let   Hr(V, µms). Then cup product with  is compatible with the Gysin sequence in Theorem 2.3, i.e. there is a commutative diagram:

Hi(V, µmj)


H i+r(V, µmj+s)

/ Hi(U, µmj)
|U

/ H i+r(U, µmj+s)

/ H i+1-2c(Z, µmj-c)
|Z

/ H i+r+1-2c(Z, µmj+s-c)

/ Hi+1(V, µmj)


/ H i+j+1(V, µmj+s)

Proof. It follows from the construction of the isomorphism in (2.10) via the spectral sequence (2.9) that the cup product map

 : HZi (V, µmj)  Exti(iZZ , µmj) / Exti+r(iZZ , µmj+s)  HZi+r(V, µmj+s) identifies via (2.10) to the map given by cup product with the restriction of  to Z:

|Z : H i-2c(Z, µmj-c) / H i+r-2c(Z, µmj+s-c).
The commutative diagram in question thus follows directly from Lemma 2.2 and Theorem 2.3. This concludes the proof.

Remark 2.5. In algebraic topology, the cohomology group HZi (V, -) with support corresponds to the relative cohomology group Hi(V, U; -) of the pair (V, U) and the long exact sequence (2.6) identifies to the long exact sequence of the pair (V, U). Moreover, the isomorphism in (2.10) corresponds to the Thom isomorphism in differential topology,

UNRAMIFIED COHOMOLOGY, ALGEBRAIC CYCLES AND RATIONALITY

which asserts that if Z is a closed complex submanifold of a complex manifold V of pure codimension c and with complement U = V \ Z, then
Hi(V, U ; Z(j))  Hi-2c(Z, Z(j - c)),

where Z(j) := (2i)j ·Z  C denotes the j-th Tate twist of Z. Combining both results one obtains a topological version of the Gysin sequence in Theorem 2.3. The compatibility result with cup products stated in Lemma 2.2 is in this context proven in [Dol72, VII.8.10].

3. Residue maps

Let A be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field K and residue field . Applying Theorem 2.3 to V = Spec A, Z = Spec  and U = Spec K, we get a long exact sequence of the form

(3.1) . . . / Hi(A, µmj) / Hi(K, µmj)  / Hi-1(, µmj-1) / Hi+1(A, µmj) / . . . .

One then defines the residue map

(3.2)

A := - : Hi(K, µmj) / Hi-1(, µmj-1),

as the negative of the above boundary map . Here the minus sign is necessary to make our definition compatible with the definition of the residue map in Galois cohomology or Milnor K-theory, cf. [CT95, §3.3]. By definition, the residue map has the property that its kernel coincides with the image of the natural map Hi(A, µmj) / Hi(K, µmj).

Lemma 3.1. Let A be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field K and residue field . Then for any   Hi1(A, µmj1) with image   Hi1(K, µmj1) and any   Hi2(K, µmj2), we have
(  ) = ()  ,
where   Hi1(, µmj1) denotes the image of .

Proof. This is a direct consequence of Lemma 2.4.

We also need the following well-known lemma, see e.g. [CTO89, Proposition 1.3].

Lemma 3.2. Let A be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field K and residue field . Let m be an integer invertible in  and let  denote the valuation on K that corresponds to A. Then the composition
 : H1(K, µm)  K/(K)m / H0(, Z/m)  Z/m
coincides with the homomorphism that is induced by the valuation  : K  Z.

Remark 3.3. Since the cup product in ´etale cohomology is graded commutative and bilinear, Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 completely determine the residue map on symbols (a1, . . . , an) as in (2.2), cf. [Sch19b, Lemma 2.1].

3.1. Compatibility with pullbacks. Let K/K be a field extension and let m be a positive integer that is invertible in K. We can think about this as a morphism f : Spec K  Spec K of schemes. Since ´etale cohomology is contravariant with respect to arbitrary morphisms of schemes (see e.g. [Mil80, p. 85, III.1.6(c)]), we thus get pullback maps
f  : Hi(K, µmj) / Hi(K, µmj).
Let  be a discrete valuation on K with valuation ring A and residue field A. Assume that the restriction  = |K of  to K is a nontrivial valuation on K with valuation ring A and residue field A. This is a subfield of A and so we get a natural morphism g : Spec A  Spec A.
Let  be a uniformizer of A and let e := () be the valuation of  in the valuation ring A, which is a non-negative integer that measures the ramification of the extension A  A. Then we have a commutative diagram

(3.3)

Hi(K, µmj)
O
f
Hi(K, µmj)

A / H i-1(A , µmj-1) ;
O
e·g
A / H i-1(A, µmj-1)

see e.g. [CTO89, p. 143], where the statement is proven after identifying the above ´etale cohomology groups with the corresponding Galois cohomology groups.

3.2. Compatibility with pushforwards. Let now K/K be a finite field extension and

let m be a positive integer that is invertible in K. We fix a discrete valuation  on K

with valuation ring A. Let A  K be the integral closure of A. By the Krull­Akizuki

theorem (see [Bou72, p. 500, Ch. VII, §2, no. 5, Prop. 5]), A is a Dedekind domain

with

finitely

many

maximal

ideals

m1, . . . , mr.

Each

localization

Al

:=

A ml

is

a

discrete

valuation ring with fraction field K and we denote its residue field by Al, which (by

the aforementioned Krull Akizuki theorem) is a finite extension of A. In particular, the

natural morphisms f : Spec K  Spec K and gl : Spec Al  Spec A are finite, hence

proper, and we get pushforward morphisms

f : Hi(K, µmj) / Hi(K, µmj) and (gl) : Hi(Al , µmj) / Hi(A, µmj),
for all i and all l = 1, . . . , r. Under the additional assumption that A is a finite A-module, we then get the following compatibility result.

Lemma 3.4. Let K/K be a finite field extension and let m be a positive integer that is invertible in K. Let  be a discrete valuation on K with valuation ring A  K and let A  K be the integral closure of A in K. Assume that A is a finite A-module. Then

in the above notation, the following diagram is commutative:

(3.4)

Hi(K, µmj)
f

Hi(K, µmj)

l Al A

/

r l=1

H i-1(Al , µmj-1)

.

l(gl)

/ H i-1(A, µmj-1)

Proof. Let V  := Spec A and U  := Spec K. Let further Z  V  be the union of
the finitely many closed points Spec Al, l = 1, . . . , r. Similarly, we put V := Spec A, U := Spec K and Z := Spec A. Since A and A are normal of dimension one, they are both regular and so the Gysin sequence from Theorem 2.3 holds for (V, Z) and (V , Z).
We thus have exact sequences

(3.5) and

Hi(A, µmj)

/ H i(K, µmj) l A/ l

H i-1(Al , µmj-1)

l

/ Hi+1(A, µmj),

(3.6)

Hi(A, µmj) / Hi(K, µmj) A / Hi-1(A, µmj-1) / Hi+1(A, µmj).

Since A is a finite extension of A, there is a natural pushforward map from each of the terms of (3.5) to the respective terms of (3.6). To prove the lemma, we need to see that these morphisms yield a morphism between the (exact) complexes in (3.5) and (3.6).
Since the natural morphism f : V   V is finite, we have Rpfµmj = 0 for p  1, see e.g. [Mil80, VI.2.5]. Applying the same reasoning to the base change of f to U and Z (which we denote by the same letter f ), we obtain natural isomorphisms

Hi(U , µmj)  Hi(U, fµmj), Hi(V , µmj)  Hi(V, fµmj) and Hi(Z, µmj)  Hi(Z, fµmj).
The sequence (3.5) is thus by (2.8) isomorphic to the sequence (2.7) with F = fµmj, while (3.6) is isomorphic to (2.7) with F = µmj. The norm homomorphism induces a natural morphism of ´etale sheaves fµmj  µmj on V . This induces a morphism from the long exact sequence (2.7) with F = fµmj to that for F = µmj. Using the above identifications, one checks that this morphism of long exact sequences is nothing but the
morphism between (3.5) and (3.6) that is induced by the respective pushforward maps. This concludes the proof of the lemma.

Remark 3.5. The commutativity in (3.3) can be proven similarly as above, by replacing the norm map fµmj  µmj by the natural map µmj  fµmj. Note however that in this case, the pullback map HZi (V, µmj) / HZi (V , µmj) corresponds via the Gysin isomorphism (2.10) to the morphism
H i-2c(Z, µmj) / H i-2c(Z, µmj)

10

STEFAN SCHREIEDER

that is given by e times the pullback morphism, where e denotes the ramification index of the ring extension A/A.

3.3. A consequence of Bloch­Ogus' theorem. The following result, known as injectivity and codimension 1 purity property for ´etale cohomology, is a consequence of Bloch­Ogus' proof [BO74] of the Gersten conjecture for ´etale cohomology, cf. [CT95, Theorems 3.8.1 and 3.8.2].

Theorem 3.6. Let X be a variety over a field k and let m be a positive integer that is invertible in k. Let x be a point in the smooth locus of X. Then the following hold:
(a) The natural morphism

(3.7)

Hi(OX,x, µmj) / Hi(k(X), µmj)

is injective. (b) A class   Hi(k(X), µmj) lies in the image of (3.7) if and only if  has trivial
residue along each prime divisor on X that passes through x.

4. Unramified cohomology
Let K/k be a finitely generated field extension and let  be a discrete valuation on K. We say that  is a valuation on K over k, if  is trivial on k. The valuation ring A  K of  is a discrete valuation ring with fraction field K and we denote its residue field by . By (3.2), we get a residue map
 := A : Hi(K, µmj) / Hi-1(, µmj-1),
for any positive integer m that is invertible in k.
Definition 4.1. Let K/k be a finitely generated field extension. A geometric valuation  on K over k is a discrete valuation on K over k such that the transcendence degree of  over k is given by
trdegk() = trdegk(K) - 1.
The following lemma goes back to Zariski, see e.g. [KM08, Lemma 2.45] or [Mer08, Proposition 1.7].
Lemma 4.2. Let K/k be a finitely generated field extension. A discrete valuation  on K over k is geometric if and only if there is a normal k-variety Y with k(Y )  K such that the valuation  corresponds to a prime divisor E on Y , i.e. for any   K, () = ordE(), where we think about  as a rational function on Y .

Definition 4.3 ([CTO89, Mer08]). Let K/k be a finitely generated field extension and let m be a positive integer that is invertible in k. We define the unramified cohomology of K over k with coefficients in µmj as the subgroup
Hni r(K/k, µmj)  Hi(K, µmj)
that consists of all elements   Hi(K, µmj) such that for any geometric valuation  on K over k, we have () = 0.
Remark 4.4. Unramified cohomology was introduced by Colliot-Th´el`ene and Ojanguren [CTO89, Definition 1.1.1] into the subject. In their original definition (that is also used in the survey [CT95]), they ask  = 0 for any discrete valuation  of K over k. The version in Definition 4.3 where one restricts to geometric valuations has later been introduced by Merkurjev [Mer08, §2.2]. It follows from Proposition 4.10 below that both definitions coincide if there is a smooth projective variety X over k with k(X) = K. In particular, both notions coincide for any finitely generated field extension K/k if k is perfect and resolution of singularities is known for varieties over the field k (e.g. char(k) = 0). In general it seems however unclear whether both definitions coincide. We prefer to work with the definition given above, as it has slightly better formal properties (e.g. it admits proper pushforwards, see Proposition 4.7 below).

4.1. Stable invariance. One of the most important properties of unramified cohomology is the fact that it is a stable birational invariant (cf. [CTO89, Proposition 1.2] and [Mer08, Example 2.3]), that is, it does not change if one passes from a field K to a purely transcendental extension of K.

Lemma 4.5. Let K/k be a finitely generated field extension and let m be a positive

integer that is invertible in k.

Let

morphism. Then the canonical morphism

f  : Hni r(K/k, µmj)  / Hni r(K(An)/k, µmj)

is an isomorphism.

Proof. By induction, it suffices to prove the case n = 1. By the Faddeev sequence (see [GS06, Theorem 6.9.1]), the following is exact:

The zero on the left implies Exactness in the middle of

the above sequence shows that any class   Hni r(K(A1)/k, µmj) is of the form f  for some   Hi(K, µmj) and we need to show that if f  is unramified over k,  must

have trivial residue at any geometric valuation of K over k. By Lemma 4.2, any such valuation corresponds to a prime divisor E on some k-variety Y with function field K. But then E × P1 is a prime divisor on the k-variety Y × P1 with function field K(A1) and the fact that f  has trivial residue along this divisor shows by (3.3) that  has trivial residue along E, as we want. (Here we used implicitly the injectivity of the natural map Hi-1(k(E), µmj-1)  Hi-1(k(E)(A1), µmj-1), which follows from the Faddeev sequence above, applied to K = k(E).) This concludes the proof of the lemma.
The above lemma has by (2.3) the following immediate consequence.

Corollary 4.6. Let X be a variety over an algebraically closed field k and let m be a positive integer that is invertible in k. If X is stably rational, then Hni r(k(X)/k, µmj) = 0 for all i > 0.

4.2. Functoriality. Unramified cohomology has the following functoriality properties.

Proposition 4.7. Let K/K/k be a finitely generated fields extensions, let f : Spec K  Spec K be the natural morphism and let m be an integer that is invertible in k.
(a) Then f  : Hi(K, µmj)  Hi(K, µmj) induces a pullback map
f  : Hni r(K/k, µmj) / Hni r(K/k, µmj).
(b) If f is finite, then f : Hi(K, µmj)  Hi(K, µmj) induces a pushforward map
f : Hni r(K/k, µmj) / Hni r(K/k, µmj)
with f  f  = deg(f ) · id.
Proof. Item (a) follows directly from (3.3). In item (b) the equality f  f  = deg(f ) · id holds already on the level of ´etale
cohomology and so it suffices to show that f is well-defined on the subgroup of unramified classes. To this end, let   Hni r(K/k, µmj) and let  be a geometric valuation on K over k. We then need to show that f = 0. Since  is geometric, we can construct a normal projective variety Y with k(Y )  K such that  corresponds to the valuation associated to a codimension 1 point y  Y (1). Since K/K is a finite field extension, we can further construct a normal projective variety Y  with a surjective morphism f : Y   Y such that k(Y )  K and f  : k(Y )  k(Y ) corresponds to the given inclusion K  K. Since f is generically finite and surjective, and y  Y is a codimension 1 point, the reduced preimage (f -1(y))red is given by finitely many codimension 1 points y1 , . . . , yr of Y . We claim that the integral closure A  K of A := OY,y in K is nothing but the local ring of Y  at the finitely many codimension 1 points y1 , . . . , yr of Y . Indeed, Spec A  Spec A can be constructed by first taking the fibre product of the proper morphism f : Y   Y with the inclusion Spec OY,y  Y and precomposing this with

the normalization map Spec A  Y  ×Y Spec OY,y. This description also shows that Spec A  Spec A is proper, hence finite as it is clearly quasi-finite. Hence, A is a finite ring extension of A. Moreover, the localizations of A at its finitely many maximal ideals are exactly the local rings OY ,yl, l = 1, . . . , r. Since   Hni r(K/k, µmj) is unramified, we know that
  OY ,yl = 0
for all l = 1, . . . , r and so the commutative diagram (3.4) shows that f = 0, as we want. This completes the proof.

4.3. Restriction to scheme points and pullbacks for morphisms between smooth projective varieties. Theorem 3.6 has the following important consequences, which show that unramified classes on smooth projective varieties can be restricted to any scheme point.

Proposition 4.8. Let X be a smooth variety over a field k and let m be a positive integer that is invertible in k. Let   Hni r(k(X)/k, µmj).
(a) Then for any x  X, there is a well-defined restriction

|x  Hi((x), µmj). (b) If X is also proper over k, then |x  Hi((x)/k, µmj) is unramified over k.

Proof. We begin with the proof of (a). By part (b) in Theorem 3.6, we know that  admits a lift ~  Hi(OX,x, µmj) and this lift is unique by part (a) of Theorem 3.6. The restriction |x may thus be defined as image of ~ via the natural morphism

Hi(OX,x, µmj) / Hi((x), µmj).

This concludes the proof of (a). To prove (b), let Z be a normal variety over k with k(Z)  (x) and let z  Z(1) be
a codimension 1 point of Z. We then have to prove that z(|x) = 0, or, equivalently, that |x lies in the image of the natural map

(4.1)

Hi(OZ,z, µmj) / Hi((x), µmj).

Since X is proper, we may up to shrinking Z around z assume that the isomorphism
k(Z)  (x) of fields is induced by a morphism of schemes  : Z  X such that the generic point of Z maps to x  X. Since   Hni r(k(X)/k, µmj) is unramified over k, Theorem 3.6 implies that  lies in

(4.2)

Hi(OX,(z), µmj)  Hi(k(X), µmj).

14

STEFAN SCHREIEDER

By (2.4), this means that there is an open neighbourhood U  X of (z) and a class ~  Hi(U, µmj) that restricts to  on the generic point Spec k(X). Since (z) lies in the closure of the point x  X, it follows that U contains x and so ~ has an image in

Hi(OX,x, µmj)  Hi(k(X), µmj)
which must be  by (4.2). In particular, the restriction |x  Hi((x), µmj) that we defined above coincides with the image of ~ via the natural map

Hi(U, µmj) / Hi((x), µmj).

Since (z)  U, this shows that |x lies in the image of (4.1), as we want. This concludes the proof of the proposition.

Corollary 4.9. Let f : X  Y be a morphism between smooth proper varieties over a field k and let m be a positive integer that is invertible in k. Then there is a well-defined pullback map
f  : Hni r(k(Y )/k, µmj) / Hni r(k(X)/k, µmj)
which is given by restricting a given unramified class   Hni r(k(Y )/k, µmj) to the generic point of the image of f and pulling that back to k(X).

Proof. By Proposition 4.8, the restriction of  to the generic point of the image of f is unramified over k and so is its pullback to k(X) by Proposition 4.7. This proves the corollary.

4.4. It is enough to check residues on a smooth proper model. The codimension 1 purity property (see item (b) in Theorem 3.6) implies the following, cf. [CT95, Theorem 4.1.1].

Proposition 4.10. Let X be a smooth proper variety over a field k and let m be a positive integer that is invertible in k. Then a class   Hi(k(X), µmj) is unramified over k if and only if  has trivial residue along any prime divisor on X.
Proof. One direction is trivial. For the converse, assume that   Hi(k(X), µmj) has trivial residue along any prime divisor on X. We then need to show that for any normal variety Y over k that is birational to X and for any codimension 1 point y  Y , we have y = 0. Equivalently, we need to see that  lies in the image of the natural map
Hi(OY,y, µmj) / Hi(k(X), µmj).
Since Y is normal, the rational map  : Y X is defined in codimension 1 and so up to shrinking Y around the codimension 1 point y, we may assume that  : Y  X is a

15

morphism. Let x = (y)  X be the image of y. Then we get a commutative diagram

H i(OX,x, µmj)

(

Hi(k(X), µmj)



6

H i(OY,y, µmj)

and so our claim follows from part (b) in Theorem 3.6.

4.5. Comparison with usual cohomology. Let X be a smooth proper variety over a field k and let m be invertible in k. It follows immediately from Proposition 4.10 that the image of the natural map

Hi(X, µmj) / Hi(k(X), µmj)

lies in the subgroup of unramified classes and so we get a well-defined map

(4.3)

Hi(X, µmj) / Hni r(k(X)/k, µmj).

It is not hard to show that this is an isomorphism for i = 1 (see [CT95, Proposition 4.2.1]) and surjective for i = 2 and j = 1. However, starting from i = 3, this map is in general neither injective nor surjective.
The kernel of (4.3) consists of all cohomology classes   Hi(X, µmj) that vanish on some non-empty Zariski open subset of X. For instance, if i = 2j is even and  = cj(E) is the Chern class of a vector bundle E, then  lies in the kernel of (4.3) because any vector bundle is generically trivial. For i = 2 and j = 1, this observation can be used to prove the following, see [CT95, Proposition 4.2.3].

Proposition 4.11. Let X be a smooth projective variety over a field k and let m be

invertible in k. For i = 2 and j = 1, the natural map (4.3) is surjective and its kernel

is given by the image of c1 : Pic X  H2(X, µm). In particular, there is a natural

isomorphism

Hn2r (k(X )/k,

µm)



im(c1

:

H2(X, µm) Pic X  H2(X,

µm)) .

It follows from the Kummer sequence (2.1) that the right hand side in the above isomorphism is isomorphic to the m-torsion of the Brauer group Br(X) = H2(X, Gm) of X.

Remark 4.12. For k = C, Colliot-Th´el`ene­Voisin [CTV12] found a relation between the third unramified cohomology of a smooth projective variety and the failure of the integral

Hodge conjecture for codimension two cycles on X. A generalization of this result to cycles of arbitrary codimension was recently given in [Sch20].

5. Merkurjev's pairing

Let X be a smooth proper variety over a field K and let m be invertible in K. (Here it is important to allow K to be non-algebraically closed, e.g. the function field of a variety over a smaller field k.) Let Z0(X) denote the group of 0-cycles on X, i.e. the free abelian group generated by the closed points of X.
For a closed point z  X, we denote by fz : Spec (z)  Spec K the structure morphism. Following Merkurjev [Mer08, §2.4], we then define for any unramified class   Hni r(K(X)/K, µmj) a class
z,  := (fz)(|z)  Hi(K, µmj),

where |z  Hi((z), µmj) denotes the restriction from Proposition 4.8. We may extend this definition to arbitrary 0-cycles z  Z0(X) linearly and so we obtain a bilinear pairing

(5.1)

Z0(X) × Hni r(K(X)/K, µmj) / Hi(K, µmj), (z, )  / z,  .

The main result about this pairing is the following proposition due to Merkurjev, which shows that the pairing descends to the level of Chow groups, cf. [Mer08, §2.4].

Proposition 5.1. Let K be a field and let m be an integer that is invertible in K. Let g : C  X be a non-constant morphism between smooth proper K-varieties, where C is a curve. Then for any   Hni r(K(X)/K, µmj) and any non-zero rational function   K(C), we have
g div(),  = 0,
where div()  Div(C) denotes the divisor of zeros and poles of .

Before we prove Proposition 5.1 in Section 5.2, let us explain some of its applications.

5.1. Applications of Proposition 5.1.

Corollary 5.2. Let X be a smooth proper variety over a field K. Then (5.1) descends to a bilinear pairing

(5.2)

CH0(X) × Hni r(K(X)/K, µmj) / Hi(K, µmj), (z, )  / z,  .

Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Proposition 5.1.

The next result is originally due to Karpenko and Merkurjev, see [KM13, RC-I].

UNRAMIFIED COHOMOLOGY, ALGEBRAIC CYCLES AND RATIONALITY

Corollary 5.3. Let X and Y be smooth proper varieties over a field k and let m be an integer that is invertible in k. Then there is a bilinear pairing

CHdim X (X × Y ) × Hni r(k(Y )/k, µmj) / Hni r(k(X)/k, µmj), (, )  / ,

which via linearity is defined as follows: if   X × Y is integral and does not dominate the first factor, then  := 0; otherwise, the first projection induces a finite morphism p : Spec ()  k(X), where  denotes the generic point of , and we put

 := p((pr2 )|).

Proof. Assume that   X × Y is a subvariety of dimension dim X that dominates X via the first projection and let  be the generic point of . By Proposition 4.8, (pr2 )|  Hni r(()/k, µmj) is unramified over k and so
p((pr2 )|)  Hni r(k(X)/k, µmj)
is unramified over k by Proposition 4.7. Hence, our definition of  is well-defined and we get a bilinear pairing

(5.3)

Zn(X × Y ) × Hni r(k(Y )/k, µmj) / Hni r(k(X)/k, µmj), (, )  / .

It remains to see that this pairing descends to the level of Chow groups. For this, let K := k(X) denote the function field of X. Then there are natural group homomorphisms

Zdim X (X × Y ) / Z0(YK) and Hni r(k(Y )/k, µmj) / Hni r(K(Y )/K, µmj). Since K = k(X) and Hni r(K/k, µmj)  Hi(K, µmj), this induces a diagram

Zdim X (X × Y ) × Hni r(k(Y )/k, µmj)

*

Hi(K, µmj)



4

Z0(YK) × Hni r(K(Y )/K, µmj)

which is commutative by the definition of the pairings in (5.1) and (5.3). Since the natural map Zdim X(X × Y ) / Z0(YK) descends to a map CHdim X(X × Y )  CH0(YK), we deduce from Corollary 5.2 that the pairing (5.3) satisfies  = 0 whenever  is a cycle that is rationally equivalent to 0. This concludes the proof of the corollary.

18

STEFAN SCHREIEDER

5.2. Proof of Proposition 5.1. For the proof of Proposition 5.1, we will need the following compatibility result for the pairing defined in (5.1).

Lemma 5.4. Let g : X  Y be a morphism between smooth proper K-varieties. The pairing (5.1) has the following properties.
(i) For any   Hni r(K(Y )/K, µn j) and any z  Z0(X), we have
gz,  = z, g ,
where g  Hni r(K(X)/K, µmj) is defined by Corollary 4.9. (ii) If X and Y are curves and g is finite and surjective, then for any   Hni r(K(X)/K, µn j)
and any w  Z0(Y ), we have
gw,  = w, g ,
where g  Hni r(K(Y )/K, µmj) is defined by Proposition 4.7 and gw denotes the flat pullback of cycles.

Proof. By linearity, it suffices to prove (i) in the case where z is a closed point of X. Let fz : Spec (z)  Spec K be the structure morphism. Then we have

z, g = (fz)(g)|z.

If y = g(z) denotes the image of z in Y , with structure morphism fy : Spec (y)  Spec K, then g induces a morphism gz : Spec (z)  Spec (y) with fz = fy  gz and so we find

z, g = (fz)(g)|z = (fy  gz)(gz(|y)) = deg(gz) · (fy)(|y), where we used (gz)  (gz) = deg(gz). On the other hand, gz = deg(gz) · y and so

gz,  = deg(gz) · y,  = deg(gz) · (fy)(|y).

This proves item (i) of the lemma.

To prove item (ii), it suffices as before to deal with the case where w is a closed point

of Y . Since g is finite and surjective and X and Y are both smooth and proper curves, g is flat and so the pullback gw is defined on the level of cycles. Explicitly, it is given by

r
gw = ar · zl
l=1

where z1, . . . , zr denote the closed points of X that lie above w and where ar denotes the ramification indices of OY,w  OX,zi (recall that X and Y are smooth proper curves by the assumption in (ii)). Then we have

r

r

gw,  = al · zl,  = al · (fzl)(|zl),

l=1

l=1

UNRAMIFIED COHOMOLOGY, ALGEBRAIC CYCLES AND RATIONALITY

where fzl : Spec (zl)  Spec K denotes the structure morphism. On the other hand, if fw : Spec (w)  Spec K denotes the structure morphism and gzl : Spec (zl)  Spec (w) denotes the natural morphism induced by g, then

w, g = (fw)(g)|w.
To simplify this further, let   OY,w be a parameter. The rational function  yields a class ()  H1(k(Y ), µm)  k(Y )/(k(Y ))m and we have by Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 the following well-known formula

By the projection formula,

(g)|w = w(g  ()). g  () = g(  (g)).

Using the compatibility (3.4), we thus get

r
w(g  ()) = wg(  (g)) = (gzl)zl(  (g)).
l=1
Since  is unramified and g  OX,zl coincides up to a unit with the al-th power of a parameter of OX,zl, we deduce from Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 that

zl (  (g)) = al · |zl.

Putting everything together, this yields

r

r

w, g = (fw)w(g  ()) = (fw)( al · (gzl)|zl) = al · (fzl)(|zl),

because fzl = fw  gzl. Hence, gw,  = w, g , which concludes the proof of the lemma.

By Lemma 5.4, we thus find g div(),  = g(0 - ),  = (0 - ), g = 0 - , g = 0, g - , g .
We claim that this last difference vanishes. To see this, note that g  Hni r(K(P1)/K, µmj)

20

is unramified over K by Proposition 4.7 and Corollary 4.9. Hence, Lemma 4.5 implies that there is a class   Hi(K, µmj) with
g = f ,

where f

:

P1 K

 Spec K denotes the structure morphism.

Using this, we find by the

above calculation that

g div(),  = 0, f  - , f  = f0,  - f,  = 0,

where we used item (i) of Lemma 5.4 in the second equality and f0 = f  Z0(Spec K) in the last equality. This proves the proposition.

6. Generalization to schemes with normal crossings
Let k be a field. Let X be a pure-dimensional algebraic scheme over k. If Xi with i  I denote the irreducible components of X, then for any non-empty subset J  I, we define
XJ := Xl.
lJ
Definition 6.1. A pure-dimensional algebraic scheme X over a field k with irreducible components Xi with i  I is called snc (simple normal crossings) scheme if for each nonempty subset J  I, the subscheme XJ  X is either empty or smooth of codimension |J|, the cardinality of J.
Definition 6.2. Let X be a proper snc scheme over a field k and let m be a positive integer invertible in k. We then define the unramified cohomology of X with values in µmj as the subgroup
Hni r(X/k, µmj)  Hni r(k(Xl)/k, µmj)
lI
that consists of all collections  = (l)lI of unramified classes l  Hi(k(Xl)/k, µmj), such that for all l, l  I
l|XlXl = l |XlXl , by which we mean that l and l have the same restriction to each component of Xl  Xl via the restriction maps from Proposition 4.8.
If X is a smooth proper variety over k, then
Hni r(X/k, µmj) = Hni r(k(X)/k, µmj).
For any nonempty subset J  I, we get a well-defined restriction map
Hni r(X/k, µmj) / Hni r(XJ /k, µmj),   / |XJ

UNRAMIFIED COHOMOLOGY, ALGEBRAIC CYCLES AND RATIONALITY

21

which is defined by picking any index l  J and defining |XJ on each component of XJ as restriction of l. This is well-defined (i.e. does not depend on the choice of l) by the compatibility condition in Definition 6.2.

6.1. A pairing on the level of 0-cycles. Let X be a proper snc scheme over a field K with irreducible components Xl, l  I. Then there is a bilinear pairing

Z0(X) × Hni r(X/K, µmj) / Hi(K, µmj),

defined by

(6.1)

(z, )  / z,  :=

(-1)|J|-1 z|XJ , |XJ ,

=J I

where we note that XJ is smooth and where z|XJ denotes the 0-cycle given by intersecting the 0-cycle z  Z0(X) with XJ  X in the naive sense, i.e. we simply keep that part of z that lies on XJ (this is an operation on the level of cycles that does not pass to the level of Chow groups).1

Lemma 6.3. Let X be a proper snc scheme over a field K and let m be a positive integer that is invertible in K. If z is a closed point of X with structure morphism fz : Spec (z)  Spec K and   Hni r(X/K, µmj), then for any component Xl with z  Xl, we have
z,  = (fz)(l|z).

Proof. By definition

z,  =

(-1)|J|-1(fz)((|XJ )|z).

=J I zXJ

Up to replacing X by the union of those components that contain z, we may assume that z  Xl for all l  I. We then find

z,  =

(-1)|J|-1(fz)((|XJ )|z).

=J I

The compatibility condition in Definition 6.2 ensures that

(fz)((|XJ )|z) = (fz)((|XJ )|z).

1The formula in (6.1) is motivated by the specialization formula of Nicaise and Shinder in [NS19] which itself is motivated by formulas in motivic integration.

for all non-empty J, J  I. Hence, for any l  I, we have

z,  =

= (fz)(l|z),

where we used in the last equality that

|I | r=1

This proves the lemma.

Proposition 6.4. Let K be a field and let m be an integer that is invertible in K. Let X be a proper snc scheme over K and let g : C  X be a non-constant morphism from a smooth proper curve C. Then for any   Hni r(X/K, µmj) and any non-zero rational function   K(C), we have
g div(),  = 0,
where div()  Div(C) denotes the divisor of zeros and poles of .

Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Lemma 6.3 and Proposition 5.1.

Corollary 6.5. The pairing (6.1) descends to a bilinear pairing CH0(X) × Hni r(X/K, µmj) / Hi(K, µmj)
on the level of Chow groups.

Proof. This is a direct consequence of Proposition 6.4.

6.2. A pairing on the level of correspondences. Let X and Y be proper reduced algebraic schemes over a field k and assume that Y is an snc scheme. Let further m be an integer that is invertible in k. We aim to define a bilinear pairing
(6.2) Zdim X (X × Y ) × Hni r(Y /k, µmj) / Hi(k(Xl), µmj), (, )  / (()l)lI ,
lI
where Xl with l  I denote the irreducible components of X. It suffices to define ()l for each l  I, i.e. the composition of (6.2) with the natural projection to Hi(k(Xl), µmj). To this end, fix l  I and note that flat pullback induces a natural map
Zdim X (X × Y ) / Z0(Yk(Xl)),
which descends to the level of Chow groups, i.e. sends cycles rationally equivalent to 0 on X × Y to cycles rationally equivalent to 0 on Yk(Xl). In addition, there is a natural

UNRAMIFIED COHOMOLOGY, ALGEBRAIC CYCLES AND RATIONALITY

23

map Hni r(Y /k, µmj)  Hni r(Yk(Xl)/k(Xl), µmj). Using this, we define (, )  / ()l,

by asking that the diagram

+

l Hi(k(Xl), µmj)



3

Z0(Yk(Xl)) × l Hni r(Yk(Xl)/k(Xl), µmj)

,

is commutative, where the lower horizontal arrow is induced by (6.1).

Corollary 6.6. Let X and Y be proper reduced algebraic schemes over a field k and assume that Y is an snc scheme. Let further m be an integer that is invertible in k. Then the pairing (6.2) descends to a well-defined pairing

(6.4)

CHdim X (X × Y ) × Hni r(Y /k, µmj) / Hi(k(Xl), µmj).
lI

Proof. Since (6.3) commutes, Corollary 6.5 implies that  = 0 whenever   Zdim X(X× Y ) is rationally equivalent to 0. This proves the corollary.

Remark 6.7. The above corollary generalizes Corollary 5.3 in two ways: X and Y may be reducible and X may be arbitrarily singular.

7. Decompositions of the diagonal
The following notion goes back to Bloch [Blo79] (using an idea of Colliot-Th´el`ene) and Bloch­Srinivas [BS83], and has for instance been studied in [ACTP13] and [Voi15].

Definition 7.1. An algebraic scheme X of pure dimension n over a field k admits a decomposition of the diagonal if

(7.1)

[X ] = [X × z] + [ZX]  CHn(X ×k X),

where X  X ×k X denotes the diagonal, z  Z0(X) is a 0-cycle on X and ZX is a cycle on X ×k X which does not dominate any component of the first factor.

For

instance,

X

=

Pn k

admits

a

decomposition

of

the

diagonal,

because

CHn(Pn

×k

Pn)

is generated by [Pn × {x}] for some k-rational point x  Pn together with cycles that do

not dominate the first factor (namely hn-i × hi for i = 1, . . . , n, where hi  Pn denotes

a linear i-dimensional subspace).

24

To give a reducible example with a decomposition of the diagonal, we will now show

that

the

union

X

=

Pn k

H

Pn k

of

two

copies

of

Pn k

glued

along

a

hypersurface

H



Pn k

admits a decomposition of the diagonal as long as H admits a k-rational point. Indeed, if

we write X = X1  X2, where X1, X2 are the irreducible components of X, then X ×k X

has the 4 irreducible components Xi ×k Xj with i, j  {1, 2}. The class of the diagonal

X may then be written as

[X ] = [X1] + [X2 ]  CHn(X × X),

where Xi  Xi × Xi denotes the diagonal. Because of the proper pushforward map

CHn(Xi × Xi) / CHn(X × X)

for each i = 1, 2, we may use the decomposition of the diagonal of Xi for each i constructed above to get an identity

X = [X1 × x1] + [X2 × x2] + [ZX ]  CHn(X × X),
where xi  Xi is a k-rational point of Xi and ZX is a cycle on X ×k X which does not dominate any component of the first factor. This decomposition has not yet the form required in (7.1). However, since H contains a k-rational point, any two k-rational points of X are rationally equivalent (they may be joined by a chain of two lines). This implies in particular [X2 × x1] = [X2 × x2] and so
X = [X × x1] + [ZX]  CHn(X × X).
This gives a decomposition of the diagonal X as in (7.1), as claimed. Since in the above definition, X is an arbitrary algebraic k-scheme, it may be illustra-
tive to also consider a slightly more exotic example, such as X = Spec C over the ground field k = R. In this case, the choice of a root of -1 in C identifies X ×R X to the disjoint union of two copies of Spec C (the Galois group of X/R permutes the two copies). The diagonal X is isomorphic to Spec C (it corresponds to one of the two components once we fixed a root of -1). Hence, X is a 0-cycle of degree 2 on the proper R-scheme X ×R X. On the other hand, any 0-cycle z on X is just a multiple of X and so the cycle X × z will have degree divisible by 4. This shows that no decomposition as in (7.1) exists (where we note that ZX needs to be empty, as any nonzero cycle on X ×R X dominates both factors).
The following lemma generalizes the observation made in this last example, by showing that a proper algebraic scheme X with a decomposition of the diagonal is geometrically connected and of index one, i.e. X contains a 0-cycle of degree one.

Lemma 7.2. Let X be a proper algebraic scheme of pure dimension n over a field k. If X admits a decomposition of the diagonal as in (7.1), then the following holds:

UNRAMIFIED COHOMOLOGY, ALGEBRAIC CYCLES AND RATIONALITY

25

(1) the 0-cycle z on X in (7.1) has degree one; (2) X is geometrically connected.

Proof. Since X is proper, the projection pr1 : X ×k X  X to the first factor gives rise to a proper pushforward map

(pr1) : CHn(X ×k X) / CHn(X). If a decomposition as in (7.1) exists, then

(pr1)[X] = (pr1)[X × z] = deg(z) · [X]  CHn(X).

Since (pr1)[X ] = [X]  CHn(X) and because this class is non-torsion (in fact CHn(X) is a free abelian group on the irreducible components of the reduced scheme Xred), the

above identity implies deg(z) = 1, as we want. This proves (1).

If X admits a decomposition of the diagonal, then for any field extension K/k, the

algebraic K-scheme XK = X ×k K admits a decomposition of the diagonal as well, simply by taking flat pullbacks of (7.1). To prove (2), it thus suffices to show that X

is connected if it admits a decomposition of the diagonal. For a contradiction, assume

that X = mi=1Xi is the disjoint union of finitely many algebraic k-schemes X1, . . . , Xr

with r  2. We may then write the 0-cycle z from (7.1) in the form z =

r i=1

zi

such

that zi is supported on Xi. Pulling back the equality (7.1) to Xi ×k Xj for i = j (this is

possible because Xi ×k Xj is an open subscheme of X ×k X and so the inclusion is flat),

we find that

Xi × zj  CHn(Xi ×k Xj)

is rationally equivalent to a cycle that does not dominate Xi via the first projection. Pushing this identity forward to the first factor, we find that zj has degree zero. Since r  2, this holds for all j and so the 0-cycle z has degree zero, contradicting item (1). This concludes the proof.

In the case of varieties, we have the following important result.

Lemma 7.3. A variety X over a field k admits a decomposition of the diagonal if and only if there is a 0-cycle z  Z0(X) on X such that

(7.2)

[X ] = [zK ]  CH0(XK),

where K = k(X) and where X denotes the 0-cycle on XK that is induced by the diagonal X .

Proof. Let n := dim X. There is a natural isomorphism
lim/ CHn(U ×k X)  / CH0(XK).
=U X

Using this, a decomposition of the diagonal (7.1) implies directly an identity as in (7.2) and the converse follows from the localization sequence [Ful98, Proposition 1.8].

The following theorem which in the smooth proper case is due to Merkurjev, relates the notion of decompositions of the diagonal with unramified cohomology, cf. [Mer08, Theorem 2.11].

Theorem 7.4. Let k be a field and let m be a positive integer that is invertible in k. Let X be a proper snc scheme (e.g. a smooth proper variety) over k. If X admits a decomposition of the diagonal, then the natural morphism
 : Hi(k, µmj) / Hni r(X/k, µmj)
is surjective for all i. In particular, Hni r(X/k, µmj) = 0 for all i > 0 if k is algebraically closed.

Proof. Assume that X admits a decomposition of the diagonal as in (7.1) and let Xl with l  I denote the components of X. By Corollary 6.6, the pairing (6.2) descends to a well-defined pairing

(7.3)

CHdim X (X × X) × Hni r(X/k, µmj) / Hi(k(Xl), µmj).
lI

It follows form the definition of this pairing in (6.2) that

[X ] = 

for all On the other hand

  Hni r(X/k, µmj)  Hi(k(Xl), µmj).
lI
[ZX] = 0,

whenever ZX  CHdim X (X × X) does not dominate any component of the first factor. Hence, (7.1) implies

 = [X ] = [X × z] + [ZX ] = [X × z].

If z = s as[xs] for some integers as and closed points xs  X with structure morphisms fxs : Spec (xs)  Spec k, then

[X × z] = ( as(fxs )|xs),
s

where

 : Hi(k, µmj) / Hni r(X/k, µmj)

is the natural morphism. This proves the theorem.

7.1. Connection to rationality and stable birational types. For the following result, see [CTP16a, Lemme 1.5] in the smooth case and [Sch19b, Lemma 2.4] in general.

Lemma 7.5. A variety X over a field k that is stably rational (or more generally retract rational) admits a decomposition of the diagonal.

Proof. Recall that X is retract rational if there are rational maps f : X

PN k

and

g

:

PN k

X with g  f = id (here we ask implicitly that the composition g  f is

defined). This condition is for instance satisfied if X is stably rational. We denote by

f



X

×

PN k

and

g



PN k

×

X

the

closure

of

the

graph

of

f

and

g,

respectively.

Replacing X by a projective model, we may assume that X is proper over k. Replacing

X by f , we may also assume that f is a morphism, which is automatically proper since

X is proper. For any field extension K of k, we then get morphisms

f : CH0(XK) / CH0(PNK) and g : CH0(PNK) / CH0(XK),

where

g

is

defined

by

pulling

back

cycles

from

PN K

to

(f )K

(using

[Ful98,

Definition

8.1.2],

which

works

because

PN K

is

smooth)

and

pushing

these

cycles

forward

to

XK

via

the natural proper morphism (f )K  XK.

Let now K = k(X) be the function field of X. Then

[X ] = g  f[X ],

because g  f = id implies g  f = id. On the other hand, CH0(PNK)  Z is generated by

[zK] for any

k-point z

of

PN k

.

Since

f[X ]

has

degree

one,

it

follows

that

f[X ] = [zK ]

and so

[X] = g  f[X ] = g[zK ] = [(gz)K ],

which shows that X admits a decomposition of the diagonal by Lemma 7.3.

The above lemma implies that a variety that does not admit a decomposition of the diagonal cannot be stably rational. Motivated by work of Shinder [Shi19], the following generalization is proven in [Sch19c, Theorem 1.1].

Theorem 7.6. Let k be an uncountable algebraically closed field and let X be a smooth projective k-variety that does not admit a decomposition of the diagonal. Then for any positive integers n and d, X is not stably birational to a very general hypersurface of degree d and dimension n over k.

Remark 7.7. Let B := PH0(Pnk+1, O(d)) and let Y  B be the universal degree d hypersurface in Pnk+1. The conclusion of the above theorem means that there is a countable union (that depends on X) of proper closed subsets of B such that any hypersurface Y ,
that corresponds to a point outside this countable union, is not stably birational to X.

28

STEFAN SCHREIEDER

The above result is a consequence of Theorem 7.8 below (see [Sch19c, Theorem 4.1]). To state the result, we need to recall the following terminology.
Firstly, for a discrete valuation ring R, a proper flat R-scheme X is called strictly semi-stable, if the special fibre X0 is a geometrically reduced simple normal crossing divisor on X . That is, the components of X0 are smooth Cartier divisors on X and the scheme-theoretic intersection of r different components of X0 is either empty or smooth and equi-dimensional of codimension r in X .
Secondly, a proper variety X over a field k has universally trivial Chow group of 0-cycles if for any field extension K/k, the degree map deg : CH0(XK)  Z is an isomorphism. If X is smooth and proper over k, then this is equivalent to (7.2) and hence equivalent to the fact that X admits a decomposition of the diagonal.

Theorem 7.8. Let R be a discrete valuation ring with algebraically closed residue field k. Let  : X  Spec R and  : X   Spec R be flat projective morphisms with geometrically connected fibres such that  is strictly semi-stable and  is smooth. Assume
(1) the special fibre X0 of  has universally trivial Chow group of 0-cycles; (2) the special fibre X0 of  does not admit a decomposition of the diagonal. Then the geometric generic fibres of  and  are not stably birational to each other.

7.2. Torsion orders. Let X be a rationally chain connected proper variety over a field k (e.g. a smooth Fano variety, see e.g. [Kol96, Theorem V.2.13]). This means that any two points of the base change XL of X to any algebraically closed field L  k can be joined by a chain of rational curves (if k is uncountable then it suffices to ask this for L = k). In particular, the degree map
deg : CH0(Xk) / Z is an isomorphism and this property remains true if we replace k by a larger algebraically closed field. We thus find that for any 0-cycle z  CH0(X) of degree one, the 0-cycle
X - zk(X)  CH0(Xk(X))
lies in the kernel of the natural map
CH0(Xk(X)) / CH0(Xk(X)). But then there must be a finite extension L of k(X), so that the above 0-cycle vanishes already in CH0(XL). Since the natural composition
CH0(Xk(X)) / CH0(XL) / CH0(Xk(X))
is given by multiplication by deg(L/k), we find that
X - zk(X)  CH0(Xk(X))

UNRAMIFIED COHOMOLOGY, ALGEBRAIC CYCLES AND RATIONALITY

29

is a torsion class. This motivates the following definition, that has for instance been studied in [CL17], [Kah17], and [Sch20].

Definition 7.9. Let X be a proper variety over a field k and let X be the 0-cycle on Xk(X) that is induced by the diagonal X. Then the torsion order Tor(X)  N  {} of X is the smallest positive integer such that the 0-cycle Tor(X) · X may be written as
Tor(X) · X = zk(X)  CH0(Xk(X)),
for some zero-cycle z on X, and it is  if no such integer exists.

Remark 7.10. By Lemma 7.3, Tor(X) = 1 if and only if X admits a decomposition of the diagonal and the same argument shows that for any positive integer e, e · X admits a decomposition as in (7.1) if and only if Tor(X) <  divides e.

If k is algebraically closed and X is smooth and proper, then the torsion order of X bounds the order of any unramified cohomology class  on X of cohomological degree at least 1, as for deg   1 and Tor(X) < ,

0 = Tor(X) · X - zk(X),  = Tor(X) · X ,  = Tor(X) · ,
because zk(X),  = 0 as  restricts to zero on any closed point of X (because k is algebraically closed).

Lemma 7.11. Let f : X  Y be a proper dominant morphism between proper kvarieties. If Tor(X) < , then

Tor(Y ) | deg(f ) · Tor(X).

Proof. The morphism f induces a proper morphism f × f : X × X  Y × Y and hence a proper morphism f  : Xk(X)  Yk(Y ) with
0 = f (Tor(X) · X - zk(X)) = deg(f ) · Tor(X) · Y - fzk(X)  CH0(Yk(Y )).
This implies Tor(Y ) | deg(f ) · Tor(X), as we want.

Corollary 7.12.

Let Y

a

and

Let X

Y

be the closure of the graph of f .

Then X

is a proper variety over

k and the second projection yields a morphism f  : X  Y of degree deg(f ) = deg(f ).

Since X is rational, it has torsion order 1 by Lemma 7.5 and so the corollary follows

from Lemma 7.11.

8. Specialization method

The specialization method that we explain in this section was initiated by Voisin [Voi15], with important improvements by Colliot-Th´el`ene­Pirutka [CTP16a] and later some further improvements by the author [Sch19a, Sch19b].

Notation 8.1. Let R be a discrete valuation ring with fraction field K and algebraically closed residue field k. Let  : X  Spec R be a proper flat R-scheme with connected fibres and denote by X = X × K and Y = X × k the geometric generic fibre and special fibre of .

Fulton showed the following specialization result for Chow groups, see [Ful75, §4.4] and [Ful98, §20.3].

Theorem 8.2. In the notation 8.1, let X = X ×R K. Then we have for any integer i a specialization map
sp : CHi(X) / CHi(Y ),
which is defined by sp() = |Y , where  denotes the closure of  in the total space X and where |Y denotes its restriction to Y , i.e. the pullback of  to the Cartier divisor Y  X.

Proof. Since R is a discrete valuation ring, the closure  in X of a cycle  on the generic fibre X will automatically be flat over R. Hence the map in the theorem exists on the level of cycles and we only need to see that it descends to the Chow group modulo rational equivalence. By [Ful98, p. 154, §1.9], the following sequence is exact
CHi+1(Y )  / CHi+1(X ) j / CHi(X) / 0,
where  : Y  X and j : X  X denote the natural morphisms. Assume that  and  are two rationally equivalent i-dimensional cycles on X with closures  and  in X . Then j[] = j[] and so
[] - [] = 
for some   CHi+1(Y ). On the other hand, Y is a principal Cartier divisor on X that contains the support of  and so () = 0 by the definition of , see [Ful75, §1.7]. Hence, [] = []  CHi(Y ), as we want. This concludes the proof.
Fulton's theorem has the following consequence.

Corollary 8.3 ([Voi15, CTP16a]). In the notation 8.1, if X admits a decomposition of the diagonal and the special fibre Y is pure-dimensional (e.g. this is automatic if X is integral by Krull's Hauptidealsatz), then Y admits a decomposition of the diagonal as well.

UNRAMIFIED COHOMOLOGY, ALGEBRAIC CYCLES AND RATIONALITY

31

Proof. Replacing R by its completion we may assume that in the notation 8.1 R is complete. Let n := dim Y . Since  is flat and Y is pure-dimensional, X is also puredimensional of dimension n. Assume that there is a decomposition of the diagonal

[X ] = [X × z] + [ZX]  CHn(X ×K X)
of X. This implies that there is a finite field extension L/K, so that the above relation holds over L. Since R is complete, the integral closure of R in L is a discrete valuation ring R, see e.g. [EGAIV, Th´eor`eme 23.1.5 and Corollaire 23.1.6]. Hence, replacing X  Spec R by the finite base change Spec R  Spec R, we may assume that the above relation is defined and holds already over the field K. Applying the specialization map from Theorem 8.2, we then find

[Y ] = sp([X]) = [Y × sp(z)] + sp[ZX ]  CHn(Y ×k Y ),
where sp(z)  CH0(Y ) is a 0-cycle on Y . Projecting the closure of ZX to the first factor yields a cycle on X that is automatically flat over R and which has generically dimension at most n - 1. It follows that also the special fibre of this cycle has dimension at most n - 1. We deduce that sp[ZX] can be represented by a cycle on Y ×k Y whose image via the first projection has dimension at most n - 1 and so it does not dominate any component of Y , as Y is of pure dimension n. Hence, Y admits a decomposition of the diagonal, as we want. This concludes the corollary.

Together with Theorem 7.4, we deduce the following criterion, which has in this form been proven by Colliot-Th´el`ene­Pirutka, thereby generalizing an earlier version of Voisin [Voi15], who initiated the method.

Theorem 8.4 ([CTP16a, Th´eor`eme 1.12]). In the notation 8.1, assume that Y is integral and that the following holds:
· Hni r(k(Y )/k, µmj) = 0 for some i > 0 and some j; · there is a resolution  : Y   Y such that  : CH0(YL )  CH0(YL) is an
isomorphism for all field extensions L/k.
Then X does not admit a decomposition of the diagonal.

Proof. For a contradiction, assume that X admits a decomposition of the diagonal.
Then so does Y by Corollary 8.3. By Lemma 7.3, Y = zk(Y ) holds in CH0(Yk(Y )). By assumption,  : CH0(YL )  CH0(YL) is an isomorphism for L = k(Y ) and so we find Y  = zk (Y ) in CH0(Yk(Y )) and for some 0-cycle z on Y . Since k(Y ) = k(Y ), this shows by Lemma 7.3 that Y  admits a decomposition of the diagonal, and so Theorem
7.4 yields Hni r(k(Y )/k, µmj) = 0,
which contradicts our assumptions. This concludes the theorem.

32

STEFAN SCHREIEDER

Thanks to our generalization of Merkurjev's pairing to the case of snc schemes in Section 6, we obtain immediately the following (new) variant of the above theorem.

Theorem 8.5. In the notation 8.1, assume that Y is a snc scheme over k with Hni r(Y /k, µmj) = 0
for some i > 0 and some integer m that is invertible in k. Then X does not admit a decomposition of the diagonal.

Proof. For a contradiction, assume that X admits a decomposition of the diagonal. Then so does Y by Corollary 8.3. Hence, Theorem 7.4 yields
Hni r(Y /k, µmj) = 0,
which contradicts our assumptions. This concludes the theorem.
To apply the above theorems to a given projective variety X, one has to construct a resolution of an integral degeneration Y of X, or an R-model X of X whose special fibre is an snc scheme. On the other hand, the special fibre needs to have non-trivial unramified cohomology and practice shows that this usually forces the model X to be highly non-smooth.
The presence of the singularities in the special fibre makes it often very hard (and sometimes practically impossible) to compute a model X or a resolution  : Y   Y as in the above theorems. This problem was solved in [Sch19a], where it was shown that much more singular models can be used. This method was generalized further in [Sch19b, Proposition 3.1] (allowing alterations instead of resolutions), as follows.

Theorem 8.6 ([Sch19a, Sch19b]). In the notation 8.1, assume that X and Y are integral.
Let m  2 be an integer that is invertible in k. Suppose that for some integers i  1 and j there is a class   Hni r(k(Y )/k, µmj) of order m such that for any alteration  : Y   Y and any (scheme) point x  Y  with  (x)  Y sing we have

(8.1)

( )|x = 0  Hi((x), µmj).

Then X does not admit a decomposition of the diagonal.

Remark 8.7. The main point of the above result lies in the fact that in many situations of interest, condition (8.1) is automatically satisfied (cf. Theorem 10.1 below); that is, one often gets the condition (8.1) on the singularities for free, without even computing an alteration (or resolution).

Remark 8.8. It is not hard to see that the proof that we give below still works in the case where the special fibre might be reducible and Y in the above theorem is replaced by a reduced component of the special fibre, see [Sch20, Proposition 6.1] for more details.

UNRAMIFIED COHOMOLOGY, ALGEBRAIC CYCLES AND RATIONALITY

33

Remark 8.9. The proof will show more generally that the torsion order of X is either infinite or divisible by m, see Definition 7.9.

Proof of Theorem 8.6. Let A = OX,Y be the local ring of X at the generic point of Y . Since Y is reduced, it follows that A is a discrete valuation ring with residue field k(Y ). Since X admits a decomposition of the diagonal, so does Y by Corollary 8.3. We can restrict this identity in the Chow group of Y × Y to Yk(Y ) and get an equality

Y = zk(Y )  CH0(Yk(Y ))

where z is a 0-cycle on Y and Y denotes the 0-cycle that is induced by the diagonal.
By Gabber's improvement of de Jong's alteration theorem [deJ96], there is an alteration  : Y   Y whose degree is coprime to m, see [IT14, Theorem 2.1]. We would like to pull back the above relation to the Chow group of 0-cycles of Yk(Y ). In general this is impossible if Yk(Y ) is not smooth. Instead we can restrict the above equality to
the smooth locus of Yk(Y ) (using flat pullbacks) and pulling back this identity to the Chow group of 0-cycles on  -1(Yks(mY )). By the localization exact sequence (see [Ful98, Proposition 1.8]), we then get an identity

(8.2)

 = zk(Y ) + z  CH0(Yk(Y )),

where  is the 0-cycle on Yk(Y ) that is induced by the graph of  inside Y  × Y , z  CH0(Y ) is a 0-cycle on Y  and z  CH0(Yk(Y )) is a 0-cycle whose support satisfies

supp(z)   -1(Y sing)k(Y ).

The definition of the pairing in (5.1) thus shows by (8.1) that z,   = 0. Since k is algebraically closed and so Hi(k, µmj) = 0, we also have zk(Y ),   = 0. By linearity, we then get
zk(Y ) + z,   = 0.
Using (8.2), the above relation in CH0(Yk(Y )) thus shows by Corollary 5.2 that
 ,   = 0.

On the other hand, the definition of the pairing in (5.1) yields

 ,   =  ,  = deg  · Y ,  = deg  · .

Hence, deg  ·  = 0  Hi(k(Y ), µmj),
which contradicts the fact that  is nonzero and deg  is coprime to m. This concludes the proof of the theorem.

STEFAN SCHREIEDER

Theorems 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6 yield together with Lemma 7.5 a powerful method to obstruct rationality of varieties that have interesting specializations. Using entirely different methods, Nicaise­Shinder [NS19] and Kontsevich­Tschinkel [KT19] recently showed the following related result.

Theorem 8.10 ([NS19, KT19]). In the notation 8.1, assume that k has characteristic 0, that X is regular and that Y is an snc scheme. Let Yl with l  I denote the irreducible components of Y and write YJ := lJ Yl for any J  I. If

(8.3)

[Pdkim X ]

holds true in the free abelian group on (stable) birational equivalence classes of smooth k-varieties, then X is not (stably) rational.

Remark 8.11. In order to show that (8.3) holds, one has to show in practice that at

that

successfully by Nicaise­Ottem [NO19], who use as an input known stable irrationality

results, which in turn are proven by applications of Theorems 8.4 or 8.6.

9. Examples with nontrivial unramified cohomology
In this section we collect some of the most important known constructions of rationally connected varieties Y over algebraically closed fields with nontrivial unramified cohomology. All examples have the following approach in common.
(1) Start with a smooth projective rational variety S and a nontrivial class   Hi(k(S), µmj).
(2) Construct another variety Y (usually of larger dimension) together with a dominant morphism f : Y  S such that f = 0. This usually requires that the ramification locus of Y is contained in the ramification locus of  and often both loci will coincide.
(3) Construct a rationally connected variety Y with a dominant morphism f : Y  S such that: (i) ´etale locally at any (codimension one) point of S where  has nontrivial residue, the fibration f coincides with the fibration f up to birational equivalence; (ii) Zariski locally over S, the fibrations f and f are not birationally equivalent.
(4) Show that f   Hi(k(Y ), µmj) is unramified over k by exploiting (3i). The idea is that f  can possibly only have residues above points on S where  ramifies,

UNRAMIFIED COHOMOLOGY, ALGEBRAIC CYCLES AND RATIONALITY

35

but condition (3i) ensures that ´etale locally at such points, f  is 0 and so it must have trivial residue. (5) Find a reason why f  is nonzero; this is a tricky point, because f  will be unramified by item (4) and so it is a priori impossible to check nontriviality by a residue computation. An obviously necessary condition here is condition (3ii).

Remark 9.1. In [Sch19b] and [Sch20], it was shown that the following flexible condition ensures the nonvanishing of f : f  is nonzero if there is a degeneration Y0  S of Y  S, so that there is a k(S)-rational point in the smooth locus of the generic fibre of Y0  S.

Remark 9.2. We emphasize that conditions (3i) and (3ii) do not automatically imply that the aim in items (4) and (5) can be achieved, it should rather be seen as a guideline how to find potential candidates for which one might hope to be able to prove (4) and (5).

9.1. Quadric bundles `a la Artin­Mumford and Colliot-Th´el`ene­Ojanguren. The starting point here is the following result of Arason [Ara75] and Orlov­Vishik­ Voevodsky, see [OVV07, Theorem 2.1].

Theorem 9.3. Let K be a field of characteristic 0, let a1, . . . , an  K and consider the associated symbol  = (a1, . . . , an)  Hn(K, µmn). Consider the associated Pfister quadric f : Q / Spec K over K, given by

(2) j = 0 for j = 1, 2 (if k = k, this is equivalent to asking that for each j = 1, 2, j has at least one nontrivial residue at some geometric valuation ).

With this definition and the above theorem, it is easy to prove the following result that goes back to Colliot-Th´el`ene­Ojanguren, see [Sch19a, Proposition 17].

Proposition 9.5 ([CTO89]). Let k be a field of characteristic 0 and let Y be a k-variety with a dominant morphism f : Y  Pnk, such that the generic fibre of f is stably birational to a CTO-type quadric Q1+2 over the function field k(Pn). Then
0 = f 1 = f 2  Hnnr(k(Y )/k, µ2 n).
Proof. By Theorem 9.3, f (1 + 2) = 0 and so f 1 = f 2 (as we work with mod 2 coefficients). Moreover, f 1 = 0 would by Theorem 9.3 imply 1 = 0 or 1 = 1 + 2 (hence 2 = 0), which contradicts the assumption j = 0 for j = 1, 2. Hence,
0 = f 1 = f 2  Hn(k(Y ), µ2 n)
and it suffices to show that this class is unramified over k. For this, let  be a geometric valuation of k(Y ) over k and consider the restriction µ := |K of  to k(Pn). If µ is trivial, then f j = 0 is clear. Otherwise, µ is a geometric valuation on k(Pn) over k. By the definition of CTO-type quadrics, there is some j  {1, 2} with µj = 0 and so f j = 0 follows from the diagram (3.3). This concludes the proof of the proposition.
The main difficulty in this approach is the construction of CTO-type quadrics. The example of Artin­Mumford [AM72] is a conic that is stably birational to a CTO-type quadric surface over k(P2). CTO-type quadrics over k(P3) have been constructed by Colliot-Th´el`ene­Ojanguren in [CTO89] and the general case of CTO-type quadrics over k(Pn) for arbitrary n  2 was established in [Sch19a, Section 6].
An algebraic variant of this construction which leads to fibrations over rational bases whose generic fibres are products of certain Pfister quadrics was established by Peyre [Pey93] and Asok [Aso13]. This approach allows generalizations to µ-coefficients for any prime , but it still relies heavily on Theorem 9.3 (and its analogue for other Norm varieties associated to symbols with µ-coefficients).
9.2. The quadric surface bundle of Hassett­Pirutka­Tschinkel. For any smooth quadric surface Q  P3K over a field K, the kernel of the pullback map
H2(K, µ2 2) / H2(K(Q), µ2 2)

UNRAMIFIED COHOMOLOGY, ALGEBRAIC CYCLES AND RATIONALITY

37

is completely described by Arason in [Ara75], see e.g. [Pir18, Theorem 3.10]. Moreover,
one can use the Hochschild­Serre spectral sequence to show that the image of the above map is given by Hn2r(K(Q)/K, µ2 2). In [Pir18, Theorem 3.17], Pirutka uses these ingredients to give a general formula for the unramified cohomology Hn2r(C(Y )/C, µ2 2), where Y is a variety over C that admits a fibration f : Y  P2C whose generic fibre is a smooth quadric surface over C(P2). This general formula has the following beautiful
consequence, see [HPT18, Proposition 11].

Proposition 9.6 ([HPT18]). Let g := x20 + x21 + x22 - 2(x0x1 + x0x2 + x1x2) be the equation of the conic in P2C that is tangent to the coordinate lines xi = 0 for i = 0, 1, 2
and consider the bidegree (2, 2) hypersurface Y  P2C × P3C, given by the equation

Y := {g(x0, x1, x2) · z02 + x0x1 · z12 + x0x2 · z22 + x1x2 · z32 = 0}  P2C × P3C.

If f : Y  P2C denotes the natural morphism that is induced by the first projection, then

0 = f

x1 x0

,

x2 x0

 Hn2r(C(Y )/C, µ2 2).

Even though the above result is formulated over C, the proof remains valid over any algebraically closed field of characteristic different from 2.
One of the main differences between the examples in Section 9.1 and 9.2 is that the generic fibre of the quadric surface bundle of Hassett­Pirutka­Tschinkel in Proposition 9.6 is not (stably birational to) a Pfister quadric. On the other hand, a common feature of both results is that they rely on the fact that the kernel of the pullback map

Hn(K, µ2 n) / Hn(K(Q), µ2 n)

is known in both cases: when Q is a Pfister quadric or an arbitrary quadric surface. The kernel of the above map is not known for general quadrics, which yields a nontrivial obstacle when trying to generalize the result of Hassett­Pirutka­Tschinkel from Proposition 9.6 to higher dimensions.

9.3. Generalization. The following generalization of Proposition 9.6 was discovered in [Sch19b] and [Sch20].

A formal analogy between the example in the above theorem and that in Proposition

9.6 is as follows: the equation g in Proposition 9.6 defines a conic that is tangent to

the

three

coordinate

lines

in

P2 k

and

so

g

restricts

to

squares

on

the

coordinate

lines.

Similarly, the equation g in Theorem 9.7 restricts to a d-th power (and hence to an m-th

power because m | d) on each coordinate hypersurface {xi = 0}  Pnk . The starting point of Theorem 9.7 is the following result, which generalizes one part

of Theorem 9.3 from m = 2 to arbitrary m  2, see [Sch20, Corollary 4.2].

Lemma 9.8. Let K be a field and let m be a positive integer that is invertible in K. Let a1, . . . , an  K be invertible elements with associated symbol  = (a1, . . . , an)  Hn(K, µmn). Consider further the hypersurface

with structure morphism f : F  Spec K. Then

f  = 0  Hn(K(F), µmn).

Proof of Theorem 9.7. The case m = 2 follows from [Sch19b, Propositions 5.1 and 6.1],

and the general case of arbitrary m  2 follows from [Sch20, Proposition 4.1] and [Sch20,

Theorem 5.3]. We give (almost all) the details of the argument in what follows.

Let

 Hn(k(Pn), µmn).

Then we need to show the following two properties:

(a) f  is unramified over k; (b) f  has order m.

UNRAMIFIED COHOMOLOGY, ALGEBRAIC CYCLES AND RATIONALITY

39

Note that these properties are opposing to each other, as (a) amounts to a vanishing

result (all residues of the class in (9.1) vanish), while (b) amounts to a non-vanishing

result.

To prove (b), let F  k be the algebraic closure of the prime field of k. Then Y

is defined over F [t] and so we can consider its degeneration Y0 modulo t, which is a

hypersurface

For

a

contradiction,

assume

that there is an integer e  {1, 2, . . . , m - 1} with e · f  = 0. It is not hard to show

that this implies the following for the specialization where t = 0:

e · f0 = 0  Hn(F (Y0), µmn).

(Here by slight abuse of notation, we use that   Hn(F (Pn), µmn).) However, our

construction

implies

that

the

generic

fibre

of

f0

Y0



Pn F

has

a

F -rational

point

y0



Y0

in its smooth locus. The class e · f0 can be restricted to this point and so

e · f0|y0 = 0  Hn((y0), µmn).

On the other hand, (y0)  F (Pn) and the composition

Hn(F (Pn), µmn) / Hn((y0), µmn)  Hn(F (Pn), µmn)

given by pullback via f0 and restriction to y0 is the identity. Hence, e ·  = 0  Hn(F (Pn), µmn),

which is false as one may check by induction on n by taking residues along xn = 0. This
proves (b). To prove (a), let x  Y  be a codimension 1 point of a normal birational model of
Y . We may assume that there is a birational morphism Y   Y and so f induces a morphism f  : Y   Pn. We then need to show that x(f ) = 0, where

xn x0

 Hn(k(Pn), µmn).

This vanishing is obvious, unless f (x) is contained in the union of hyperplanes {x0x1 . . . xn =
0}  Pnk , which is the ramification locus of  on Pnk . It thus suffices to deal with the case where f (x)  {x0x1 . . . xn = 0}. The proof then splits up into two cases, as follows.
Case 1. f (x) / {g = 0}.

In this case, g is a nontrivial m-th power in the residue field of the local ring OY ,x and
so it becomes an m-th power in the completion OY ,x. The residue x : Hn(k(Y ), µmn)  Hn-1((x), µmn-1) factors through

Hn(k(Y ), µmn) / Hn(Frac OY ,x, µmn)

and the image of f  via the above map vanishes by Lemma 9.8, so that x(f ) = 0 follows, as we want.

40

STEFAN SCHREIEDER

Case 2. f (x)  {g = 0}. The main point about this case is that g = 0 meets each strata of the union of the hyperplanes xi = 0 dimensionally transversely. In particular, f (x)  {g = 0} implies that the number c of coordinate functions xi that vanish at f (x) is strictly smaller than the codimension of f (x) in Pnk :
c < codimPn(f (x)). k
It then follows from Lemma 3.1 that the valuation µ on k(Pn) that is induced by restricting the valuation on k(Y ) that is given by the codimension 1 point x  Y  satisfies

µ =   ,

for some   Hc-1((µ), µmc-1) and   Hn-c((µ), µmn-c) with   im(Hn-c((f (x)), µmn-c) / Hn-c((µ), µmn-c)).
Since k is algebraically closed, (f (x)) has cohomological dimension

n - codimPn(f (x)) < n - c, k
see (2.3). Hence, Hn-c((f (x)), µmn-c) = 0, which implies  = 0. In particular, µ = 0 and so x(f ) = 0 follows from (3.3). This completes the proof of Theorem 9.7.

10. Vanishing result and applications

The examples discussed in Sections 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 all have the following feature in

common:

Up to birational equivalence,

there is a morphism f

:Y



Pn k

whose generic

fibre is smooth and a class   Hn(k(Pn), µmn) such that f  is nonzero and unramified.

One of the main discoveries in [Sch19a, Sch18, Sch19b, Sch20] was the observation that

all these examples have the following property in common: for any smooth variety Y 

with a generically finite dominant morphism  : Y   Y , and for any point x  Y  with

 (x)  Y sing, the restriction of  f  to x vanishes:

( f )|x = 0  Hn((x), µmn).

This vanishing result is crucial, as it allows to apply Theorem 8.6 without resolving the

singularities of the special fibre (or even the whole family) of the degeneration. The

intuition behind this result is as follows:

· since the generic fibre of f is smooth, it suffices to show ( f )|x = 0 whenever

f ( (x))



Pn k

is

not

the

generic

point

of

Pnk ;

· if f ( (x)) is not contained in the ramification locus of , then the restriction

( f )|x factors via the restriction of  to the point f ( (x))  Pnk . Since the lat-

ter is not the generic point, it has codimension at least 1 and so its cohomological

UNRAMIFIED COHOMOLOGY, ALGEBRAIC CYCLES AND RATIONALITY

41

dimension is at most n - 1, which shows that |f((x)) = 0 and so ( f )|x = 0 as we want. · if f ( (x)) is contained in the ramification locus of , then the intuition is as follows: first note that  f  is unramified over k by Proposition 4.7, because f  is unramified and  is generically finite. On the other hand,  is by assumption ramified locally around the point f ( (x)) and so the most natural reason for the fact that  f  is unramified over k would be that this class in fact vanishes ´etale locally around x, so that it can be extended trivially across x. In [Sch19a, Sch18, Sch19b, Sch20] exactly this phenomenon is observed for all the examples mentioned in Sections 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3.

In the case where the generic fibre of f is a smooth quadric, the following general vanishing result, which gives some evidence for the above intuition and which makes it very easy to apply Theorem 8.6 in many situations, is proven in [Sch19b].

Theorem 10.1. Let f : Y  S be a surjective morphism of proper varieties over
an algebraically closed field k with char(k) = 2 whose generic fibre is birational to a smooth quadric over k(S). Assume that there is a class   Hn(k(S), µ2 n) with f   Hnnr(k(Y )/k, µ2 n), where n = dim(S).
Then for any dominant generically finite morphism  : Y   Y of varieties with Y 
smooth over k and for any (scheme) point x  Y  which does not map to the generic point of S via f   , we have ( f )|x = 0  Hn((x), µ2 n).

Combining these vanishing results with the examples in Sections 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3, one deduces for instance the following from the specialization result in Theorem 8.6:

· A very general hypersurface X  P2C × P3C of bidegree (2, 2) is not stably rational [HPT18]. Since the smooth bidegree (2, 2) hypersurfaces in P2C × P3C that are

known to be rational can be shown to be dense in moduli, this showed in partic-

ular that rationality is not an open nor a closed condition in smooth projective

families, see [HPT18].

· Generalizations of the aforementioned result to all standard quadric surface bun-

dles over P2, different from Verra fourfolds and cubic fourfolds containing a plane

(see [Sch18, Pau18]), as well as to quadric bundles of arbitrary fibre dimension,

see [Sch19a].

STEFAN SCHREIEDER

The results in [Sch19b, Sch20] involve a degeneration of a very general hypersurface to a hypersurface Z that has high multiplicity along a large-dimensional linear subspace P . One then needs to pass to the blow-up Y = BlP Z and one exploits that projection from P induces a fibration structure f : Y  Pn where n = dim X - dim P . While one can then use results `a la Theorem 10.1 to get the desired vanishing condition (8.1) from Theorem 8.6 at points that do not dominate Pn via f , this vanishing condition needs to be checked by hand on the exceptional divisor of the blowup BlP Z  Z, which makes the argument somewhat subtle.

Remark 10.2. In dimension N = 5, the logarithmic bound from [Sch19b] shows that

very

hypersurfaces

of

degree

five

in

P6 k

are

rational.

In

the

case

where k has characteristic 0, this result was improved by Nicaise and Ottem [NO19], who

showed that very general quartic fivefolds are stably irrational over fields of characteristic

0. Their result is achieved by an application of Theorem 8.10, and it relies eventually

on the stable irrationality of the quadric bundles of Hassett­Pirutka­Tschinkel from Sec-

tion 9.2, whose discriminant locus has smaller degree than those of the corresponding

generalizations in Theorem 9.7 that have been used in (arbitrary dimension) in [Sch19b].

11. Open Problems
11.1. Decompositions of the diagonal versus stable rationality. Recall from Lemma 7.5 that a variety that is stably rational admits a decomposition of the diagonal. It is natural to wonder whether the converse to this statement holds as well. It is known that a smooth complex projective surface X with CH0(X)  Z and without torsion in H2(X, Z) admits a decomposition of the diagonal, see [BS83, p. 1252, Remark (2)], [ACTP13, Corollary 1.10], [Voi17, Corollary 2.2] or [Kah17]. There are such surfaces that are of general type and so existence of a decomposition of the diagonal is in general not equivalent to stable rationality. However, no such counterexample is known if we restrict to the class of rationally connected varieties.
Question 11.1. Is there a rationally connected smooth complex projective variety which admits a decomposition of the diagonal, but which is not stably rational?
The above question is already open for the Fermat cubic threefold, which admits a decomposition of the diagonal by a result of Colliot­Th´el`ene [CT17], while stable irrationality is unknown. In fact, while any smooth cubic threefold in P4C is irrational by a celebrated result of Clemens and Griffiths [CG72], the question whether it is also stably irrational is open for any such cubic; cf. [Voi17] for an interesting connection of this question to the integral Hodge conjecture on abelian varieties.

UNRAMIFIED COHOMOLOGY, ALGEBRAIC CYCLES AND RATIONALITY

43

A natural approach to Question 11.1 would be given by the obstruction for stable rationality in [NS19, KT19] (see Theorem 8.10), which might a priori not be sensitive to decompositions of the diagonal.
A related classical open question pointed out by one of the referees is as follows.

Question 11.2. Is there a variety X over an algebraically closed field k which is not stably rational but such that X ×k Y is rational for some variety Y over k?

11.2. Torsion orders and unirationality. Let X be a rationally chain connected projective variety over a field k. Then its torsion order Tor(X) is finite, see Section 7.2. The class of rationally chain connected varieties is closed under several natural operations (e.g. taking products and taking quotients) and so it is natural to investigate how the torsion orders behave when performing these operations.

Lemma 11.3. Let X and Y be proper varieties over a field k whose torsion orders are finite. Then
Tor(X × Y ) | Tor(X) Tor(Y ).

Proof. The diagonal of X × Y corresponds to the product of the diagonals of X and Y . Since Tor(X)X and Tor(Y )Y admit decompositions as in (7.1), we conclude that
Tor(X) Tor(Y )X×Y admits a similar decomposition and so Tor(X × Y ) | Tor(X) Tor(Y ), as we want.

Lemma 11.4. Let X be a smooth projective variety over a field k whose torsion order is finite. For a positive integer n, we consider the symmetric product SnX = Xn/ Sym(n) of X. Then
Tor(SnX) | n! · Tor(X)n

Proof. By Lemma 7.11, applied to the quotient map Xn  SnX, we have Tor(SnX) | n! · Tor(Xn)
and so the claim follows from the previous lemma, which implies Tor(Xn) | Tor(X)n.

Question 11.5. Let X be a smooth complex projective variety with finite torsion order. Is it possible to improve the estimate from Lemma 11.4 for the torsion order of SnX?

More precisely, we may ask the following.

Question 11.6. Is it true that for any smooth complex projective variety X with finite torsion order and for any positive integer n, we have Tor(SnX) | Tor(X)n (or maybe even Tor(SnX) | Tor(X))?

In the opposite direction, it is natural to wonder about the following.

44

STEFAN SCHREIEDER

Question 11.7. Is there a smooth complex projective variety X that is rationally (chain) connected such that the prime factors of Tor(SnX) are unbounded for n  ?

A positive answer to Question 11.7 would, by the following proposition, imply the existence of a rationally connected3 smooth complex projective variety that is not unirational, which is a longstanding open problem in the field.

Proposition 11.8. Let X be a variety over a field k and assume that there is a dominant

rational

map

f

:

Pdim X k

X. Then for all n  1, we have

Tor(SnX) | deg(f )n.

In particular, the prime factors of Tor(SnX) are bounded for n  .

Proof. Taking the n-th symmetric power of f , we obtain a dominant rational map

Snf

:

Sn

Pdim k

X

SnX.

The degree of this map may be identified to deg Snf = deg(f )n. Hence, Lemma 7.11 implies
Tor(SnX) | deg(f )n · Tor(SnPdim X).

On the other hand, SnPdim X is rational by an old result of Mattuck [Mat68]. Hence, Tor(SnPdim X) = 1 by Lemma 7.5 and so the proposition follows.
