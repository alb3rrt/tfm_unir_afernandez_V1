We identify time-reversal symmetry breaking mixed parity superconducting states that feature eight Majorana corner modes in properly cleaved three-dimensional cubic crystals. Namely, when an odd-parity isotropic p-wave pairing coexists with cubic symmetry preserving even-parity octupolar dx2-y2 + id3z2-r2 pairing, the gapless surface Majorana modes of the former get localized at the eight corners, thus yielding an intrinsic third-order topological superconductor (TOTSC). A cousin dxy + id3z2-r2 pairing also accommodating eight corner Majorana modes, by virtue of breaking the cubic symmetry, in contrast, yields an extrinsic TOTSC. We identify doped octupolar (topological or trivial) Dirac insulator as the suitable platform to sustain such unconventional superconductors, realized from an intraunit cell pairing. Finally, we argue that the proposed TOTSC can be experimentally realizable in NaCl and other structurally similar compounds under high pressure.

Introduction. Localized Majorana fermions are of paramount importance for braiding and non-Abelian statistics, and their applications in topological quantum computation [1­3]. For these purposes, one-dimensional quantum nanowires offer a great potential as they can host topologically robust endpoint Majorana fermions at low temperatures: a hallmark of the traditional bulkboundary correspondence. Nonetheless, its recently discovered higher-order generalization manifesting through robust gapless modes localized on even lower-dimensional boundaries, such as corners and hinges [4­16], when extended to the territory of neutral Bogoliubov de-Gennes (BdG) quasiparticles, boosts in this regard the prominence of higher-dimensional higher-order topological superconductors (HOTSCs) [17­38]. For example, in contrast to conventional (or first-order) topological p + ip and d + id pairings, supporting one-dimensional Majorana edge modes, a two-dimensional p + id HOTSC hosts four pointlike corner localized Mojorana modes. However, thus far proposed three-dimensional (3D) HOTSCs only encompass Majorana hinge modes, while the mechanism and the platforms for the realizations of 3D corner Majorana modes remained illusive. In this Letter, we, therefore, venture the following set of questions, and provide definite answers to them. (1) What is the underlying pairing symmetry of 3D HOTSCs that supports corner Majorana modes? (2) What are the suitable material platforms where such pairings can be realized?
Key results. Here we identify two candidate mixed parity time-reversal symmetry breaking octupolar pairings, each of which supports eight zero energy Majorana corner modes in suitably cleaved cubic crystals, see Figs. 1 and 2. Specifically we show that when an odd-parity spin-triplet isotropic p-wave pairing (analog of the B-phase of 3He) coexists with an even-parity singlet dx2-y2 + id3z2-r2 pairing, the resulting mixed parity superconducting state supports eight Majorana corner modes. This pairing is a prototypical example of octupo-

lar pairing in a cubic system, transforming under the irreducible Eg representation. It only breaks the timereversal symmetry, but preserves the cubic symmetry. Thus p(dx2-y2 +id3z2-r2 ) pairing stands as an intrinsic HOTSC [39]. A close cousin, namely, p  (dxy + id3z2-r2 ) pairing, transforming under the mixed T2g and Eg representations, although supports eight corner Majorana modes, breaks the cubic symmetry. It thus stands as an extrinsic HOTSC. Since pointlike corner Majorana modes with dimensionality dB = 0 in three dimensions (d = 3) are also characterized by the codimension dc = d - dB = 3, these two paired states represent third-order topological superconductors (TOTSCs). They can be realized around an underlying Fermi surface with an additional two-fold sublattice degeneracy besides the conventional Kramers degeneracy. The corner Majorana modes are stable even in the presence of a weak swave pairing that gets induced naturally in the presence of dominant d-wave pairings. We identify doped octupolar Dirac insulator (defined later) as a suitable platform where such unconventional pairings stem from a unique fully gapped local pairing. While an intrinsic TOTSC possesses a quantized octupolar moment Qxyz = 0.5, it is trivial (Qxyz = 0) for an extrinsic TOTSC. Finally, the proposed TOTSC may be experimentally realizable in NaCl and structurally similar compounds InTe, SnAs, SnSb under high pressure [40­43].
HOTSCs around Fermi surface. The effective single particle Hamiltonian of neutral BdG fermions in the presence of p  (d + id3z2-r2 ) pairings, with  = x2 - y2 and xy, around the Fermi surface (FS), possessing Kramers and two-fold sublattice degeneracy reads

where µ = µ . Three sets of Pauli matrices {},

{ } and {} respectively act on the Nambu or particle-

hole, sublattice and spin or Kramers indices, m is the

effective mass, µ is the chemical doping, and kF is the Fermi momentum. Throughout we consider m, µ > 0,

such that the pairing of sharp normal state quasiparti-

cle excitations takes place around a well defined Fermi

surface. We are then in the weak coupling regime. The

triplet p-wave pairing with amplitude p is odd under

parity k  -k, while it preserves the time reversal sym-

metry. The two components of the cubic d-wave pairings

(with explicit forms defined below) are even under par-

ity, i.e., d1,2(-k) = d1,2(k). But the component d2(k) is

odd under the reversal of time, generated by T = 002K, where K is the complex conjugation and T 2 = -1. In ad-

dition, we also include an s-wave pairing with amplitude

s, which preserves the time reversal symmetry and gets

naturally induced in the presence of a d-wave pairing, as

both pairing channels are even under parity. The above

effective single particle Hamiltonian enjoys the particle-

hole symmetry, generated by the antiunitary operator

 = 202K with 2 = +1 and HoFcStu-1 = -HoFcStu. In the absence of d-wave and s-wave pairings, the above

Hamiltonian describes a fully gapped isotropic odd-parity

p-wave pairing (class DIII). As such, it supports two

copies of gapless Majorana surface states on all six sur-

faces of a cubic crystal, irrespective of its specific cut [44].

When s = 0 and the d-wave pairings are included, all the matrices appearing in HoFcStu mutually anticommute. Since then HoFcStu involves six mutually anticommuting
matrices, the minimal dimensionality of the matrices has

to be eight, which in turn demands an additional two-

fold sublattice degeneracy of the Fermi surface. We now

address the role of the d-wave pairings for the realization

of Majorana corner modes.

that preserves the cubic symmetry, but breaks the timereversal symmetry. The resulting dx2-y2 + id3z2-r2 state is an octupolar pairing and supports eight MajoranaWeyl nodes at ±kx = ±ky = ±kz = kF / 3 (in the absence of other superconducting orders). Even though both d-wave components transform under the irreducible doublet Eg representation of the cubic or Oh point group, their amplitudes in Eq. (1) are set to be different, since these two pairings cannot be transformed into each other by an arbitrary SO(3) rotation. Nonetheless, their transition temperatures are the same, as expected [45, 46].
In the presence of such octupolar pairing, the gapless surface states of the isotropic p-wave pairing get partially gapped, since all the involved matrices in Eq. (1) mutually anticommute. In other words, the dx2-y2 + id3z2-r2 pairing acts as a mass for gapless surface Majorana

a BdG Wilson-Dirac mass vanishes along the high sym-

metry eight body diagonal 111 directions. As a result,

the surface states of isotropic p-wave pairing are left gap-

less only at eight corners of a cubic crystal cleaved so that

they are placed at (±1, ±1, ±1)L/2, where L is the lin-

ear dimension of the system in each direction, see Fig. 1.

The resulting p  (dx2-y2 + id3z2-r2 ) pairing therefore stands as an intrinsic TOTSC that supports eight zero

energy Majorana corner modes. On the other hand, when

2 = 0, the xy surfaces and four hinges along the z direction host gapless Majorana modes, and we realize a

second-order topological superconductor [44].

that also supports eight Majorana Weyl nodes at (± 2, 0, ±1)kF / 3 and (0, ± 2, ±1)kF / 3 (in the absence of any other pairings), partially gaps out the surface Majorana modes of the isotropic p-wave superconductor. Such an octupolar pairing leaves eight corners gapless, which, as dictated by the dxy pairing component in Eq. (3), are pinned at the four side centers on each of the two xy planes in real space, see Fig. 2. The above two components of the d-wave pairings respectively transform under the T2g and Eg representations, thereby breaking the cubic symmetry and the corresponding two amplitudes in Eq. (1) are generically different. The resulting

FIG. 2: (a) Eigenvalue spectra (En) for an extrinsic TOTSC, realized around a Fermi surface, on a cubic lattice (dashed cube), cleaved in such a way (solid cube) that eight corners are now placed at the four side centers on each of the two xy planes in real space. Inset: Eight near zero energy corner modes (red dots), well separated from nearby bulk states (black dots). (b) Local density of states associated with the zero energy states in (a), displaying sharp corner localization. These results remain qualitatively unchanged in the presence of a small s-wave component, and for the local pairing shown in Eq. (7) in an octupolar Dirac material [44]. Here the linear dimensions of the system are Lx = 13, Ly = 13 and Lz = 10 in the x, y and z directions, respectively, and the parameter values are the same as in Fig. 1.

mixed parity p  (dxy + id3z2-r2 ) pairing then stands as an example of an extrinsic TOTSC. Once again if we switch off the d3z2-r2 component of the d-wave pairing, we realize a second-order topological superconductor [44].
Induced s-wave pairing. Now we address the impact of the induced s-wave component on the fully gapped TOTSC. For small a amplitude of such parasitic s-wave pairing the spectra of BdG quasiparticles remain fully gapped, and the system continues to support eight localized corner Majorana modes [44]. However, beyond a critical amplitude of the s-wave pairing, which for the intrinsic (int) and extrinsic (ext) TOTSCs are respectively

s,int = p, s,ext = 2p + 21/3 ,

(4)

the fully gapped paired state becomes topologically trivial and thus no longer supports corner modes.
Lattice model and numerical results. To anchor the above outlined key results, next we perform numerical analysis on a cubic lattice. The lattice-regularized Hamiltonian corresponding to Eq. (1), which, pending the representation of the  matrices, also describes the octupolar Dirac insulator (defined below) and the realization of the TOTSC therein, reads [47]

where a is the lattice spacing, and ml1at(k) = m0 - 6t0 + 2t0 j=1,2,3 cos(kja) is the first-order Dirac mass. For intrinsic TOTSC dl1at(k) = cos(kxa) - cos(kya) and for extrinsic TOTSC dl1at(k) = sin(kxa) sin(kya), while dl2at(k) = 2 cos(kza) - cos(kxa) - cos(kya) in both cases. Here i = 1, 2 and 3 correspond to x, y and z, respectively. Comparing with Eq. (1), we find the following correspondences among the matrices j = 13j for j = 1, 2, 3, 4 = 300, 5 = 110, 6 = 200 and ~ = 100. In particular, when we consider the parameter regime 0 < m0/t0 < 4, a single Fermi surface is realized around the  = (0, 0, 0) point of the cubic Brillouin zone, with m = (2t0a2)-1, µ = m0, kF = a-1, and p = t1. We arrive at similar conclusions when the Fermi surface is realized around the R = (, , )/a point of the Brillouin zone for 8 < m0/t0 < 12. We implement the above tight binding model on a cubic lattice with open boundary condition and numerically diagonalize it for different cuts of the crystal. The results are displayed in Figs. 1 and 2. On the other hand, for m0/t0 < 0 and m0/t0 > 12, the paired state is topologically trivial. In the following, we identify the octupolar Dirac insulator as a suitable platform for the realization of the TOTSC and the corresponding Majorana corner modes.
Octupolar Dirac insulators. The lattice model for an octupolar Dirac insulator takes the form shown in Eq. (5) when s = 0, with eight-component mutually anticommuting Hermitian  matrices now given by j = 11j for j = 1, 2, 3, 4 = 130, 5 = 120, and 6 = 200. Three sets of Pauli matrices {}, { } and {} respectively act on the spin (, ), parity (±) and sublattice (A,B) indices. The Hamiltonian is invariant under a composite PT symmetry, where T = (002)K, P = 130, and under P: k  -k. Here T and P respectively play the role of time-reversal and parity operators, with (T P)2 = -1. Furthermore, the Hamiltonian is invariant under an additional parity operator P = 210 and P : k  -k, and enjoy a unitary particle-hole or chiral symmetry, generated by 7 = 300. Even though the above model for 0 < m0/t0 < 12 supports a topological octupolar insulator with charged corner modes, here we consider the trivial regimes, m0/t0 < 0 and m0/t0 > 12. The normal state then does not support any topological boundary modes. Therefore, the appearance of Majorana bound states can solely be attributed to pairing, which we discuss next.
To select the pairing realizing the TOTSC in an octupolar insulator, we first notice that the system supports 28 (the number of purely imaginary eight-component Hermitian matrices) local (onsite or intra-unit) cell pairings, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. To capture all the pairings in a unified framework we Nambu-double the original eight-component spinor, and absorb the unitary part of the time-reversal operator (T ) in the hole part of the Nambu spinor. In such a basis the octupo-

4

lar Dirac insulator takes the form shown in Eq. (5), with sixteen-dimensional  matrices taking the explicit forms

1 = 3111, 2 = 3112, 3 = 3113,
4 = 3130, 5 = 0120, 6 = 0200. (6)
Chemical potential term takes the form -µ(3000). A local pairing (with a constant amplitude) support-
ing Majorana corner modes satisfies the following algebraic constraints. It anticommutes with the Dirac kinetic energy (proportional to t1) and commutes with the first-order Dirac mass (proportional to 4) [48]. The paired state then represents a fully gapped topological pairing with two-dimensional dispersive massless Majorana modes occupying all six surfaces of a cubic crystal, when 1 = 2 = 0. In addition, the paired state must also simultaneously anticommute with two higher-order Wilson-Dirac insulating masses (proportional to 5 and 6), such that surface states get partially gapped, leaving eight corners gapless. Only one pairing satisfies all these constraints with the corresponding effective singleparticle Hamiltonian given by

Hoctu =  (1 cos  + 2 sin ) 110,

(7)

where  is the U(1) superconducting phase and  is the pairing amplitude. This pairing is a spin-singlet, but mixes even and odd parity bands, and two sublattices. We numerically diagonalize Holacttu corresponding to the octupolar insulator in the presence of this pairing and find the eight zero-energy corner Majorana modes in a cubic system, cleaved according to the chosen form of dl1at(k), similar to Figs. 1 and 2, thus yielding a TOTSC. If, on the other hand, we set 2 = 0, the same paired state corresponds to a second-order topological superconductor with gapless hinge modes along the z direction and surface states occupying the xy surfaces [44].
These observations can be supported by projecting the pairing Hamiltonian in Eq. (7) onto the Fermi surface using the band basis of the single particle Hamiltonian in Eq. (5), and neglecting the interband pairing components. The reduced Hamiltonian (after a suitable global unitary rotation) then assumes the form of HoFcStu in Eq. (1), when expanded around the  or R point of the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, with appropriate choices of the insulating mass form factor dl1at(k) the same local pairing from Eq. (7) yields either intrinsic or extrinsic TOTSC [44]. Therefore, the local pairing Hoctu imposes a nontrivial octupolar topology when projected onto the Fermi surface, in spite of the parent insulating phase being trivial. These conclusions remain qualitatively unchanged when the normal state is a topological octupolar insulator.
Topological invariant. The intrinsic and extrinsic TOTSCs can be distinguished in terms of a bulk topological invariant, the octupolar moment Qxyz [49­51]. In

order to compute Qxyz, we first treat holelike excitations as independent particlelike excitations and compute

i n = Re - Tr

q^xyz(r) U

(8)

where q^xyz(r) = xyzn^(r)/L3, n^(r) is the number opera-

tor at r = (x, y, z), and U is constructed by columnwise

arranging the eigenvectors for the negative energy states.

The octupolar moment is defined as Qxyz = [n - nal]/2 (modulo 1), where nal = (1/2) r xyz/L3 represents n in the atomic limit and at half filling. The factor of 1/2

accounts for the artificial Nambu doubling. While the oc-

tupolar moment is quantized Qxyz = 0.5 in an intrinsic

TOTSC, it is trivial Qxyz = 0 in an extrinsic TOTSC.

Summary and discussions. Here we show that time-

reversal symmetry breaking mixed parity octupolar p 

(d + id3z2-r2 ) pairing supports eight corner localized Majorana fermions in properly cleaved cubic crystals.

There are two such orders, representing intrinsic (for

 = x2 - y2) and extrinsic (for  = xy) TOTSCs. The

corner modes can be detected by scanning tunneling mi-

croscope, for example. We furthermore identify doped

octupolar (topological or trivial) Dirac insulator as the

suitable material platform where such superconducting

order can arise from local or onsite Cooper pairs. Re-

markably, among 28 possible local pairings in this sys-

tem, the unique pairing supporting the Majorana corner

states is also the only unconventional one fully gapping

out the Fermi surface, and therefore should be energeti-

cally most favorable topological superconducting state in

a doped Dirac insulator. In addition, the TOTSC and its

associated corner modes remain stable in the presence of

a weak induced s-wave pairing.

Presently NaCl is the only known candidate material

for octupolar topological Dirac insulator [52] and it may

be a superconductor under pressure with transition tem-

perature Tc  2-7K [40]. Nonetheless, structurally anal-

ogous binary compounds like InTe, SnAs, SnSb under

high pressure also show superconductivity with Tc  1-

3K [41­43]. Given that our analysis suggests that the

doped octupolar Dirac insulator does not need to be

topological to accommodate TOTSC, which is at the

same time energetically most favorable unconventional

pairing in this system, we expect that topological nature

of superconductivity in these materials will be scrutinized

more thoroughly in the future. Our proposal should also

stimulate the search for new octupolar Dirac materials.
