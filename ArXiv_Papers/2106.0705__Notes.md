## Abstract

We review recent studies of the operator product expansion of the plaquette and of the associated determination of the gluon condensate. One first needs the perturbative expansion to orders high enough to reach the asymptotic regime where the renormalon behavior sets in. The divergent perturbative series is formally regulated using the principal value prescription for its Borel integral. Subtracting the perturbative series truncated at the minimal term, we obtain the leading non-perturbative correction of the operator product expansion, i.e. the gluon condensate, with superasymptotic accuracy. It is then explored how to increase such precision within the context of the hyperasymptotic expansion. The results fully confirm expectations from renormalons and the operator product expansion.
