Abstract It is shown that in many cases local null rotation invariance of the curvature and its first derivatives is sufficient to ensure there is an isometry group Gr with r  3 acting on (a neighbourhood of) the spacetime and containing a null rotation isotropy. Invariance of the second derivatives is additionally required to ensure this conclusion in Petrov type N Einstein spacetimes, spacetimes containing "pure radiation" (a Ricci tensor of Segre type [(11,2)]), and conformally flat spacetimes with a Ricci tensor of Segre type [1(11,1)] (a "tachyon fluid").
1 Introduction
This paper studies local null rotation invariance in spacetime, using the same definitions, techniques, conventions and notation as the companion papers studying local spatial rotation invariance and local boost invariance (MacCallum, 2021a,b), i.e. the Cartan-Karlhede procedure implemented using the Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism, the software CLASSI and the minimal set of totally symmetric spinors defined by MacCallum and °Aman (1986). Those details will, for brevity, not be repeated here. As in the previous papers, the "Newman-Penrose equations" (the Ricci equations) and Bianchi identities [(7.21a)-(7.21r) and (7.32a)-(7.32k) respectively in Stephani et al. (2003)] will be referred to below as (NPa)­(NPr) and (Ba)­(Bk). The original NP notation  = R/24 will be used, rather than the Ricci scalar R, and a prime on AB (denoted AB in Stephani et al. (2003)) is retained for consistency with the compressed notation for symmetrized spinors representing higher derivatives. Note that the Newman-Penrose  and the cosmological constant (typically also denoted by ) are not the same. Denoting the cosmological constant by L for clarity, L = R/4.
Following Ellis (1967), (Am) is the assumption that At each point P in an open neighbourhood U of a point Po, there exists a nondiscrete subgroup g of the Lorentz group in the tangent space TP which

leaves invariant the curvature tensor and all its covariant derivatives to the m-th order,
Here, as in the previous papers, the focus is on finding the minimal m for a given g which ensures that Ellis's definition (C) holds, i.e.
There exists a local group of motions Gr in an open neighbourhood W of a point Po which is multiply transitive on some q[-dimensional] surface through each point P of W .
The Gr will then include, at each P  W , an isotropy subgroup isomorphic to g leaving P fixed. (In some cases there may in addition be a proper homothety: see Sections 8.7 and 11.3 of Stephani et al. (2003).)
In this paper the group g is assumed to contain a group of null rotations1. For such local null rotation invariance, which will be abbreviated to LNRI, only conformally flat or Petrov type N spacetimes are possible. For clarity in stating results the term `null rotation isotropy' will be used only where (C) applies and the Gr contains, for each P  W , an isometry fixing P which is a null rotation. This paper aims to find the minimal values of m in (Am) for which LNRI implies null rotation isotropy.
Section 2 sets out the choices of frame and canonical form for the curvature in Section 2.1, and their implications, and then in the following subsections, respectively the conditions arising from LNRI of a Petrov type N Weyl tensor, from the Bianchi identities, and from LNRI of AB . In Section 3, the minimal (Am) guaranteeing null rotation isotropy in the different possible types of LNRI spacetimes are studied. Other than spacetimes with constant curvature, these are Petrov type N spacetimes with AB = 0 and Petrov type N and conformally flat spacetimes with non-zero AB of certain Segre types. The appendices summarize the known spacetimes admitting LNRI and the form of the Bianchi identities with the specializations of Section 2.1.

2 Preliminaries

2.1 Canonical forms of the curvature tensor, and frame choices

2.1.1 The Weyl tensor

In Petrov type N, the Weyl tensor is invariant under a two-dimensional group of null rotations. A suitable canonical form, if the repeated principal null direction preserved by the null rotations is k, is one in which the Weyl spinor has only 4 = 0.
In terms of an aligned spinor basis, the group of null rotations fixing k is

o = o,

 =  + Bo,

(2.1)

where  denotes the transformed values and B is a complex number. If there is invariance of the curvature and its derivatives for all values of B in (2.1), the

1 Here this term denotes one of the transformations (3.14) or (3.15) of Stephani et al. (2003), rather than the more general combination of these with a boost and rotation given the same name in Hall (2004). Note that in (3.15) of Stephani et al. (2003) the final l should be k.

LNRI group is two-dimensional. The transforms of the curvature spinors and their derivatives will be polynomials in B and B¯ with the untransformed values as coefficients, rather than just multiples of the untransformed values as in spatial rotation
or boost invariance. The test for LNRI then involves a set of linear equations in components of the curvature and its derivatives, as in MacCallum (2020), rather
than just the vanishing of some components. Applying a position-dependent boost2, |4| will be set to 1 in Petrov type N.
A position-dependent spatial rotation will then be used to make 4 constant: the remaining frame freedom now consists of a constant spatial rotation and position-
dependent null rotation(s) about k. The spatial rotation freedom could be used to set 4 = 1, but when there is only a one-parameter LNRI group it is more convenient to use it to make the parameter B in (2.1) pure imaginary.
That is possible, assuming that the one-parameter LNRI group acts in the same way at all points in the neighbourhood U, because in that case B = |B|ei with a fixed  and varying |B|. The remaining rotation freedom can be used to set
 = /2. (The rotation that does this will not in general also give 4 = 1.) With this one-parameter LNRI group there is still the freedom of a null rotation with
position-dependent |B|. In conformally flat spaces 4 = 0 and the Weyl tensor gives no information
on frame choice.  also cannot restrict the frame. The tracefree part of the Ricci tensor, AB , remains to be considered.

2.1.2 The Ricci tensor

As shown in MacCallum (2020), a totally symmetrized spinor ab of valence (m, n)
with m  n, such as one of the minimal set of Cartan invariants defined by MacCallum and °Aman (1986), is invariant under (2.1) only if3

ab = 0 for all pairs a + b  m - 1, 0 = (a + 1)Bab + bB¯(a+1)(b-1) otherwise.

(2.2) (2.3)

(Here one can exchange the roles of the pair m, a with those of n, b.) For a twoparameter LNRI group the only non-zero component is mn. Note that the conditions for a one-parameter LNRI group still apply (trivially) in that case.
Assuming a one-parameter LNRI group with B imaginary, (2.3) becomes

(a + 1)ab = b(a+1)(b-1).

(2.4)

For LNRI of the Ricci curvature, AB must be invariant under (2.1). The Segre types of the possible such Ricci tensors are listed in Table 1, taken from Table 5.2 of Stephani et al. (2003).
Segre type [(111, 1)] implies that AB = 0 for all A and B, so the spacetime is an Einstein space. The Bianchi identities (see Appendix B) then imply that 

2 As in the previous papers, choosing specific frames is for computational convenience. The results, being invariantly expressed, would be the same in any frame, though they might be harder to check.
3 The example found by Milson and Pelavas (2009) which requires the 7th derivative of the Riemann tensor to complete the Cartan-Karlhede procedure is a Petrov type N spacetime which has no isotropies. However, it obeys the conditions (2.2)­(2.3) at steps 0 and 1 of the Cartan-Karlhede procedure (°Aman, private communication).

is constant. If such a spacetime is conformally flat, it is one of the well-known constant curvature spacetimes, which need not be considered further ((A0) with s0 = 6 is sufficient in this case to ensure (C) above). Petrov type N Einstein spaces are included in Section 3.1.
In general relativity, type [(11, 2)] can represent "pure radiation", including a null electromagnetic field, and type [1(11, 1)] a tachyonic fluid, but types [1(1, 2)] and [(1, 3)] have no generally-accepted physical interpretation, although type [1(1, 2)] could be considered a superposition of pure radiation and a tachyonic fluid. Types [1(1, 2)] and [(1, 3)] were therefore not considered in Stephani et al. (2003), but are retained here for completeness although, without a physical basis for the form or values of the Ricci tensor, there are no equations from which physically meaningful general-relativistic solutions could be obtained. With any AB , there could be a nonzero .
Applying (2.2)­(2.3), one finds from (2.2) that 00 = 01 = 0 and, from (2.3) with imaginary B, that 02 = 211 if 11 = 0, and 12 is real if nonzero. When 12 = 0 = 11, a position-dependent null rotation can be used to bring the curvature to a canonical form in which 22 = 0. Otherwise 22 = 0 is possible. These considerations lead to the following canonical forms in an NP tetrad with k as the null vector preserved by an at least one-dimensional LNRI group and a compatible Segre type. The nonzero components AB are: Segre type [(1,3)]: 12 = 0 is real. Segre type [1(1,2)]: 02 = 211 = 0 = 22 . Segre type [(11,2)]: 22 = 0. Segre type [1(11,1)]: 02 = 211 = 0. The last two cases are specializations of the canonical form for Segre type [1(1, 2)] and there are thus strong correspondences between the calculations for these three cases.
2.1.3 Possible LNRI groups and further specializations
In conformally flat spacetimes, the null direction k defining the LNRI group cannot be fixed by the (zero) Weyl tensor, and must be determined using the Ricci tensor and its derivatives. As discussed above Ricci tensors of Segre type [(111, 1)] give only spaces of constant curvature and Petrov type N Einstein spaces. A Ricci tensor of Segre type [1(11,1)] is invariant under null rotations about either of two directions, say k and l, but if both these are in g, so is a boost invariance in the (k, l) plane because there is no two-parameter subgroup of the Lorentz group generated by such a pair of null rotations (see Table 6.1 of Hall (2004)). Such boost invariant spacetimes are conformally flat, have s = 3, admit a G6 or G7 and were

considered in MacCallum (2021b). Hence for Segre type [1(11,1)] only spacetimes which are LNRI about k and not l need be considered here. The remaining possible Segre types define the k direction uniquely.
The canonical forms above have been chosen so that for those spacetimes admitting only a one-dimensional LNRI group, B in (2.1) is imaginary. Having fixed the k direction one may still apply a spatial rotation and/or boost preserving it. A Ricci tensor of Segre type [(11,2)] has spatial rotation invariance, but the boost can be used in the conformally flat case to set |22 | = 1, and this can similarly be achieved in type [1(1,2)]. In conformally flat spacetimes with a Ricci tensor of Segre type [(1,3)] one can set 12 = 1, using the boost and spatial rotation freedoms (a position-dependent rotation was used to make B imaginary but the remaining constant rotation freedom can be used to make the necessarily real 12 positive).
One may note that with these choices of canonical frame in a conformally flat spacetime the left side of each of the Bianchi identities is real, so that the imaginary part of each right side must vanish. Moreover, if t0 = 0 all components of the curvature are constants and therefore all the left sides of the Bianchi identities are zero. The deductions from Bianchi and Ricci identities for conformally flat spacetimes with Ricci tensors of Segre types [(11,2)] and [1(11,1)] considered in, respectively, MacCallum (2021a) and MacCallum (2021b) remain true in the LNRI cases.

2.1.4 Implications for the Cartan-Karlhede procedure
The figure in MacCallum (2021a) which shows possible evolution of pairs (si, ti) at step i of the Cartan-Karlhede procedure, is repeated here as Figure 1: for full explanation see Section 2.2 of MacCallum (2021a).

Ricci tensors of types [(11,2)] and [1(11,1)] are invariant under a three-parameter linear isotropy group, so conformally flat spaces with such Ricci tensors have as their (s0, t0) pair one of the (3, T ) pairs in Figure 1. However, as discussed above, spacetimes with a Ricci tensor of type [1(11,1)] either have a boost invariance and were covered in MacCallum (2021b) or have only a one-dimensional LNRI group. Similarly spacetimes with a Ricci tensor of type [(11,2)] which have a spatial rotation invariance were discussed in MacCallum (2021a). So in this paper only groups g consisting solely of null rotations need be considered.

6

M. A. H. MacCallum

All Petrov type N spacetimes with LNRI have s0 = 2 or 1 and a g consisting only of null rotations. For LNRI conformally flat spacetimes the group g of null rotations can be two-dimensional if AB = 0, which would only give only the constant curvature spacetimes, or if AB is of Segre type [(11,2)]. Otherwise s = s1 = 1, so that (s1, t1) is of the form (1, T ) where T represents an allowed value of t in Figure 1.
If Q is a scalar function of position, then the vector defined by Q,a is

Q,a(2m(a m¯ b) - 2k(a l b)) = Q m + ¯Q m - DQ l - Q k,

(2.5)

and this must be a linear combination of vectors invariant under the LNRI group. The number of such independent vectors bounds ti above.
If there is a a two-dimensional LNRI group, k defines the only direction invariant under g, but if the LNRI group is one-dimensional there are two invariant directions, the second being given by Bm - B¯m, which for imaginary B is in the direction m + m. Whether s = 1 or 2, (2.5) shows that for any LNRI scalar Q, DQ = 0, and if s = 2, Q = ¯Q = 0 also. If s = 1 and B is imaginary, Q = ¯Q, and this is real for real Q. So in either case one will have, for an invariant Q,

DQ = 0, Q = ¯Q,

(2.6)

where Q will be real if Q is, and will be zero if s = 2. In the Cartan-Karlhede procedure, this implies that if si+1 = 2, ti  1. So when
s = 2 the Cartan-Karlhede procedure terminates at the latest at p = 2 (if the (s, t) sequence is (3, 0)  (2, 0)  (2, 1)  (2, 1)) and thus (A3) suffices. If for all i  0, si+1 = 1 = s, then ti  2. In principle (A4) could now be required, for a sequence starting at (s0, 0) for some s0 > 1 and then running through each of the (1, T ) possibilities in Figure 1 (so t0 = t1 = 0). However, this could only happen in Petrov type N Einstein spacetimes, type N "pure radiation" spacetimes, or conformally flat spacetimes with Ricci tensors of Segre types [(11,2)] or [1(11,1)]. Otherwise, (A3) would again suffice. In the sequel it is found that in all those cases (A4) is satisfied if (A0)­(A3) are, and no new information arises at the third derivative.
With a g consisting solely of null rotations, if s = 2 then tp  1 and there will be an isometry group Gr with r  5. If s = 1 there is an isometry group G3 with r  3. Appendix A reviews known spacetime metrics consistent with these bounds.
After studying the possible combinations of Weyl and Ricci tensors, it turned out to be more convenient to consider the conformally flat and Petrov N cases together in most Segre types with AB = 0, using the Bianchi identities and the conditions imposed on  by LNRI before those arising from LNRI of . The exception is Segre type [(11,2)] where the calculations for the Petrov N and conformally flat cases have fewer common features.

2.1.5 Additional invariants

The directional derivative conditions above for LNRI apply not only to components of the curvature and its derivatives in the canonically-chosen frames, but also to those spin coefficients, or combinations thereof, completely determined by the frame specializations. Several cases below lead to

 =  =  =  = 0,  =  + ,

(2.7)

Spacetimes with continuous linear isotropies III: null rotations

7

and if that is true the following are invariant under the remaining frame freedom: , ,  , and, when B is imaginary,  + ¯. When (2.7) holds, if  = 0 or if there is a one-parameter LNRI group with imaginary B, then  is also null rotation invariant. For brevity such null rotation invariants will often be called just invariants in this paper.
Two more invariant combinations of spin coefficients are found in the cases studied below. For a one-parameter LNRI group with imaginary B,  + µ¯ is invariant if  + ¯ = 0 =  + ¯ and

 + ¯ + 2( - ¯) = 0.

(2.8)

Under the same conditions,  + ¯ is invariant if  is real,

( + ¯) + ( + ¯) = 0,

(2.9)

and

 + µ¯ + 2¯ = 2 + ¯ + µ.

(2.10)

(i.e. +µ¯+2¯ is real). (The invariants' properties DQ = 0 = (-¯)Q can usually be obtained from the NP equations also, but this has not been checked in all cases.)

2.2 LNRI and derivatives of 

In a canonical frame chosen as above, all directional derivatives of 4 vanish and AB has as possibly non-zero components

30 = 24/5,

31 = 24/5,

40 = [4( + )4]/5,

41 = [4( +  )4]/5,

50 = 44,

51 = 44.

(2.11)

Whether the LNRI group has s = 1 or 2, if 4 = 0, (2.2) and (2.3) imply 30 = 31 = 40 = 0, so that

 =  =  +  = 0.

(2.12)

The Ricci tensor has not yet been specified, but one may note that the null rotation

invariance ensures that condition (C) of the Kundt-Thompson theorem as stated

in Stephani et al. (2003) is satisfied, and also that when  = 0 these spacetimes are

members of Kundt's class (Chapter 31 in Stephani et al. (2003)). (2.12) implies

that in both the Petrov N and conformally flat cases terms 4 and 4 which would otherwise appear in (Bg) and (Bh) respectively are zero.

For s1 = 2 one also has

 =  +  = 0,

(2.13)

while for s1 = 1 (with, as usual, B imaginary) one has

 =  + .

(2.14)

8

M. A. H. MacCallum

For  , (A2) requires that 2 satisfies

(i) 2AB = 0 for A + B = 0, . . . 5 (ii) 6251 = 260 , (iii) 5242 = 2251 , (iv) 3252 = 261 ,

(2.15)

In general the conditions on higher derivatives to ensure that (Am), m > 2, is satisfied do not give new conditions on the curvature and spin coefficients, so the relevant conditions, which were used in checking invariances, will not be written out here.

2.3 The Bianchi identities

The Bianchi identities with the canonical choices of frame given in Section 2.1 are written out in Appendix B. Some immediate consequences of those Bianchi identities are collected here.
When all AB = 0, (Bh) and (Bk) give  = 0 =  and for LNRI D = 0 so  is a constant.
In Segre type [(1,3)] (Bb) shows  = 0, (Bh) reads  = 12 which shows that  is real and (Bg) then implies  = 0. Compatibility with (Bj) then implies  = 0. (Bf) shows that  is real. Eliminating 12 and  between (Bc), (Bf) and (Bk) then implies

 +  + ( + ¯) = .

(2.16)

Substituting back into (Bf) then shows that , and therefore  , are real.
In Segre type [1(1,2)], (Be) gives  + ¯ = 0, (Bb) shows  is real, (Bh) shows  - ¯ is real and (Bj) then implies that  is real. However (Ba) gives  + ¯ = 0, so  = 0 and then (Bg) and (Bh) give (2.9). Elimination between (Bh) and (Bj) gives (2.8) so  + µ¯ is a null rotation invariant, and

( + ¯) = ( + ¯) + ( + ¯).

(2.17)

Hence one can write  in terms of  and  .
From MacCallum (2021a), in Segre type [(11,2)]  = 0 = , and  =  = -2( + ¯). In Petrov type N,  =  = 0 =  follows from (2.12), so  is constant, while in the conformally flat case (Bc) implies  = 0 and, setting 22 = 1, ¯ = 2( - ¯) from (Bd).
In Segre type [1(11,1)], (Be) gives +¯ = 0, (Bb) implies that  is real and (Ba) that  is imaginary. Then the real parts of  and  are null rotation invariants, (Bf) shows that µ + ¯ is real, and (Bg) and (Bh) show that  - ¯ is real and (2.9) holds. (Bj) and (Bh) imply (11 - ) = -2( + ¯)11 and (2.8). From (2.8),  can be written in terms of  and  (or ). (Bf) and (Bk) yield (11 - ) = 0.

2.4 LNRI and derivatives of 

For (A1) the non-zero Ricci curvature components satisfy DQ = 0 and Q = ¯Q as discussed in Section 2.1. When there is a two-dimensional LNRI group (A1) further requires that 33 and 244 are the only non-zero components of AB and 2AB .
When there is a one-parameter LNRI group (with imaginary B), applying (2.2) and (2.3) shows (A1) implies the following requirements on AB :

(i) AB = 0 for A + B = 0, . . . 2 (ii) 321 = 30 , (iii) 322 = 231 , (iv) 32 is real.

(2.18)

To complete the study of (A1) one needs to consider not only  and  but also AB (as defined by CDEW  = C W  CDEF , MacCallum and °Aman (1986)), which is zero in the conformally flat case. The conditions on AB arising from (2.2)­(2.3) are usually trivial to check.
With LNRI of , 00  0, (Ba) implies 01 = 0 and (Bb) implies 02 = 0, so (i) above is satisfied. The remaining conditions are best inspected case by
case (see below). The tests to be applied to 2 for (A2) are as follows.

(i) 2AB = 0 for A + B = 0, . . . 3 (ii) 4231 = 240 , (iii) 3222 = 2231 , (iv) 4232 = 2241 , (v) 4233 = 3242 , (vi) 243 is real.

(2.19)

For (Am), m > 1, one has to consider, as well as m applied to A, AB and , the derivatives of order (m - 1) of AB in Petrov type N, and higher derivatives of terms computed at previous levels of differentiation (see MacCallum and °Aman (1986)). The required conditions on these for LNRI are readily inferred
from (2.2)­(2.3).

3 LNRI spacetimes
The minimal m in (Am) with LNRI that would ensure an isometry group as in the criterion (C) quoted in Section 1 will now be studied. In the Petrov type D cases with spatial rotation or boost invariance treated in the previous papers (MacCallum, 2021a,b), all allowable Ricci tensors could be treated together. For LNRI spacetimes of Petrov type N this cannot readily be done and treating the possible Ricci tensor types separately seems necessary. That also allows one to treat the conformally flat and Petrov N cases with the same Ricci tensor type together.

10

M. A. H. MacCallum

The strategy in doing so is similar to that used in the previous papers of this series. One first fixes the frame so that the curvature has an appropriate canonical form, as set out in section 2.1. Then one can derive the implications of (A1) together with the Bianchi identities, as set out in Sections 2.2­2.4. The Bianchi identities, as given in Appendix B, are used together with the canonically nonzero components of curvature to extract conditions on the spin coefficients, and the implications of (A1) such as (2.18) are used to find further conditions. The commutator relations, NP equations and (Am), m  2, then remain to be considered.
The literature on known metrics for LNRI spacetimes, mostly of Petrov type N, surveyed in Appendix A, covers the main classes of spacetime which can be obtained by assuming (Am) with LNRI for sufficiently large m. However, more detailed consideration is needed to find the minimal m for each case that would ensure an isometry group as in condition (C) in Section 1.

3.1 LNRI spacetimes with AB = 0

These are either the well-known conformally flat spacetimes of constant curvature, which need not be considered further, or are Petrov type N Einstein spaces. In a canonically chosen frame 4 is constant and the Bianchi identities imply  is constant. So t0 = 0 and, from (2.11), the only first derivatives of the curvature that could be nonzero are 41 , 50 and 51 . (Bc) gives 4 -  = 0, so  =  = 0, using (2.12), and (Bd) gives 4 -  = 0.
If s1 = 2, these and (2.13) imply

 =  =  =  =  =  =  = 0.

(3.1)

In this case ka;b = -( + ¯)kakb, so k is proportional to (but not necessarily equal to) a covariantly constant null vector4. Thus the spacetimes are pp-waves, (A.1) (see Stephani et al. (2003), Section 24.5).
With (3.1), (NPl) shows that  = 0. Inspection of (2.12) shows that the only possible functions of position in the first derivatives are the real and imaginary parts of . The only component among the minimal set of second derivative terms defined in MacCallum and °Aman (1986) which is not identically zero is 262 = (4 + 4¯ + 202)4, and similarly at the third derivative only 373 , which is a combination of , its complex conjugate and  derivatives thereof, can be nonzero. So (A1) implies (A3), whence t1  1 so there can be at most one independent function in , say w. If w is constant the Cartan-Karlhede procedure terminates at the first step with s1 = 2, t1 = 0 and there is a group G6. These are (locally) the well-known homogeneous plane wave spacetimes ((12.12) in Stephani et al. (2003)). Otherwise t1 = 1 = t2, s2 = 2 and the Cartan-Karlhede procedure terminates at step 2. These are (locally) the pp-waves in which there is a G5 transitive on threedimensional null surfaces ((24.46) in Stephani et al. (2003)).
Thus Petrov type N spacetimes with AB = 0 admitting a two-dimensional LNRI group are pp-waves (including plane waves), and (A1) is a sufficient criterion.
4 In general ka;b is ( + ¯)kamb +  m¯ akb - m¯ amb - m¯ am¯ b + m¯ alb + (CC) - ( + ¯)kakb - ( + ¯)kalb, where (CC) stands for the complex conjugate of all the preceding terms.

Now consider s = 1 (with imaginary parameter B). From (Bc), (Bd) and the results of Section 2.2

 =  =  =  = 0,  = 4,  = 5.

(3.2)

If  = 0 the spacetime will have s = 2 so  = 0 if s = 1. (NPp), (NPq) and (NPl) read respectively

4 = 202 - 20¯, 4¯ = 202 + 12¯ + 2, 5 - ¯ = 26¯ - 102 + ,

(3.3)

which imply  = 202 - 36¯. Thus 2 must be real, so  is either real or pure imaginary, and in either case since  is constant  is constant. Thus the only possible independent function(s) of position in the first derivatives of the curvature tensor are in . With (3.2),  is an invariant so D = 0. Then (NPf) implies ( + ¯) = -8(¯), which implies  is real, and ( + ¯) = -8. Then (2.8) and (2.9) are true and  + µ¯ is an invariant.
(NPo) and (NPr) give

 = (-3 + ¯ + 5(µ + ¯)), ¯ = (3 - 5¯ + 5( + µ¯)).

Since  is an invariant,  = ¯ so 6 + 5( + µ¯) is real. With this and earlier information, (A2) can be checked. Computing 2 one finds (2.15) (i)­(iii) are satisfied, but (2.15) (iv) requires  to be real, so (µ + ¯) is also real, and (2.10) is satisfied whence  + ¯ is an invariant. 262 = [-20( + ¯) + 242 + ]4, whence  + ¯ could be a further independent function of position.
Continuing to the further derivatives, using the above information, shows (A3) and (A4) are satisfied. Thus (A2) ensures a one-dimensional null rotation isotropy group in Petrov type N if AB = 0, but unless a different way to prove  is real has been overlooked, (A1) is insufficient. The spacetime has a G3 if tp = 2, or possibly a Gr, r > 3 and is either in the (A.2) or (A.8) classes. As set out in Appendix
A, there are known LNRI Petrov N Einstein spaces in these classes, including the
Kaigorodov metric with a G5.

3.2 LNRI spacetimes with a Ricci tensor of Segre type [(1,3)]
Using the implications found in Section 2.3 from the Bianchi identities, and applying (A1) to  one finds that (2.18) (i) is true, (ii) implies  = 0, and (iii) together with (2.16) implies (2.9), (2.8) and  =  +  . (2.18) (iv) implies that 2 + ¯ + µ is real, i.e. (2.10) is true. In the conformally flat case (Bd) implies  +  + µ¯ is real so  and  + µ¯ are both real.
Hence, whether 4 = 0 or not, (2.7) holds if (A1) is true; ,  and  are real; and , , ,  ,  + µ¯ and  + ¯ are invariants. (Bc) now gives 12 = -212 and (Bf) that  = ( + ¯)12 . Note that in the conformally flat case there is still the freedom to boost to a frame such that |12 | = 1.
(NPp) gives  = 0 and then (NPf), (NPl) and (NPq) each yield  = - 2. If  = 0 then (2.9) implies  + ¯ = 0. Otherwise -2  =  = ( + ¯)12 = -2 12 implies  = 12 = 0,  is a non-constant invariant, and tp  1.

(A2) and (A3) are now identically fulfilled in all cases above as a result of the constraints found, regardless of the values of 4 and  . Since si = 1 for all i the spacetime must have at least a G3. Of the metrics in Appendix A only (A.2), with a G3 on N3, can support a Ricci tensor of Segre type [(1,3)], and an example with this Segre type is given there.

3.3 LNRI spacetimes with a Ricci tensor of Segre type [1(1,2)]
The calculations are a little more complicated in the conformally flat case, so this is treated first, using the results already stated in Section 2.3. (Bd) implies that ¯ - 2¯ - 2 is real so using the reality of  - ¯,  - ¯ = 4( - ¯). Adding the imaginary parts of (Bc) and (Bf) gives (2.10). On substituting for 11 and  from the real parts of (Bc) and (Bf) into (Bk) one obtains ¯ +  + 4 = 0.
Now let (A1) be imposed. (2.18) (i) and (ii) are identically satisfied. Evaluating the imaginary part of (2.18) (iii), using (2.10), implies that  and ¯ + µ are real. Now (Bf) implies  is real. The real part of (2.18) (iii) gives 2+ = 0 so  =  = 0, and therefore  = 0. Evaluating (2.18) (iv) then shows that  is real and hence  and  are also real and (2.17) becomes  =  +  . So (2.7) holds. With these conditions (A2) and (A3) hold and the spacetime has a group G3, r  3.
From (NPp) and (NPq),  = 211 = 2( 2 + ) so  cannot be constant (and hence tp  1). Since (11 - ) = 4 11 = 0, t0  1. Thus t1 could be 1; then the Cartan-Karlhede procedure terminates at the first step and there is a G4, which might allow a metric of the form (A.10), while if tp = 2, the Cartan-Karlhede procedure stops at step 2 or 3, giving a Barnes metric, (A.2). One can also infer from (NPo) and (NPr) that  = ( - ) = 0.
In the Petrov N case, since  = 0 =  +  from (2.12), (Be) implies  =  = 0. (2.18) will give the same equations as when 4 = 0, so again ,  and  are all real and  =  +  ,  is real and so is ¯ + µ, and all these are invariants. These conditions are useful in checking (A2), which is now easily found (with CLASSI's help) to be satisfied, as is (A3). The deductions in the previous paragraph apply to the Petrov type N case also. An example is given in Appendix A.

3.4 Petrov N LNRI spacetimes with a Ricci tensor of Segre type [(11,2)]

Although this Segre type of Ricci tensor is invariant under a three-dimensional

group, these spacetimes have only a two-dimensional LNRI group at the initial

step of the Cartan-Karlhede procedure, i.e. s0 = 2, since the spatial rotation

invariance of AB cannot be shared by the Weyl tensor. The calculations are somewhat similar to those for the Petrov type N Einstein spaces above. With the

usual choice of frame, (2.12) and (2.14) hold and if s1 = 2 so does (2.13). (Bc)

then implies  =  = 0, so if s = 1, (2.7) is true. Note that , , ,  , and  + ¯

are invariants whether s = 1 or 2.

When s = 2, so 22 = 0, then (2.13) and the Bianchi identity not yet used,

(Bd), give

54 = 3¯22 .

(3.4)

If s = 2 and  = 0, taking moduli in (3.4) yields that 22 = ±5/3. (NPl) and (NPq) give  = -¯  0. Since, as in Section 2.3  is constant, || is constant

Spacetimes with continuous linear isotropies III: null rotations

13

and t0 = 0. A constant spatial rotation could be used to make  real. Since  is a null rotation invariant,  = 0 and (NPo) implies  = 0. Inspection shows that t1 = 0 and the Cartan-Karlhede procedure terminates at the first step. The resulting spacetime is the solution of Defrise (1969) admitting a G6, which appears as (12.6) in Stephani et al. (2003). (In Stephani et al. (2003) this metric was arrived
at by assuming the G6 from the start, but the arguments are closely analogous.) If s = 2 and  = 0, (3.1) holds and as in Section 3.1 the spacetimes are pp-
waves. Following the arguments in that Section,  = 0, and as  is a null rotation
invariant, its only possible nonzero derivative is . Unless t0 = 0 and t1 = 1 the Cartan-Karlhede procedure terminates at step 1, and otherwise at step 2, with respectively a G5 if t1 = 1 or a G6 if t1 = 0. The possible metrics have been discussed by Sippel and Goenner (1986) (see Appendix A). For these cases only (A1) was needed.
If s = 1, (NPp) and (NPq) imply  = - ¯ so | | is constant, as in the case
s = 2 with  = 0 =  +  . Substituting into (NPl), remembering that  is a null rotation invariant, shows that (2( - ¯) - ( - ¯)) = 0. Hence two cases result,
depending on whether  = 0 =  +  or not.
If s = 1 and  = 0 =  +  , then 22 = 0 would imply s1 = 2 by inspection of the only non-zero quantities with q = 1 in the minimal set of MacCallum and °Aman (1986). One also has (3.4), and by the same arguments as above one arrives
at the Defrise metric, (A.9), or pp-waves. So one must have 22 = 0, whence t0 = 1 (4 and  being constant), and (A4) will not be required. To consider (A2), note that from (NPp),  = 0 = , whence (2.15) is satisfied. From (2.19) (v) with 22 = 0, 2¯ =  + ¯ so  and  are real and constant. (2.9) and (2.8) are true. If  = 0 = , (NPo) and (NPr) imply  is real. (2.19) (vi) implies (after use of the [, ] commutator) that  + µ¯ is also real. Then (A3) is true and there is at least a G3, assuming (A2).
If s = 1 and  = 0, then ( - ¯) = -2( - ¯) and ( - ¯) = ( - ¯) + ( - ¯) = -(-¯). (A1) is then satisfied. Since  is an invariant, (NPf) implies (2.9) (and thus (2.8)). Checking (A2), (2.15) (ii) and (iii) are then satisfied. (2.15) (iv) gives (2.10). Conditions (2.19) are then satisfied. The quantities , +µ¯ and  +¯ are invariants. Using this information, (A3) is then satisfied. The curvature components other than 22 are constants, so t0  1 while s0 = 2 and s1 = 1. If 22 is not constant, then since t2  2, the Cartan-Karlhede procedure will terminate at the latest at p = 2 (with a sequence (2, 1)  (1, 1)  (1, 2)) and there will be a G3 or, if t2 = t1 = 1, a G4. Only if 22 is constant and t0 = t1 = 0 is a check of (A4) required. The inferences above from (A1) and (A2) remain true and t1 = 0 implies that (from (2.11)) that  and  are constants as well as 22. With these extra conditions (A4) is readily checked (using CLASSI).

3.5 Conformally flat LNRI spacetimes with Ricci tensor of Segre type [(11,2)]
By Theorem 37.19 of Stephani et al. (2003), all conformally flat pure radiation spacetimes (with  = 0) are included in the metrics (37.104)­(37.106) there. Here the m required in (Am) to ensure that an LNRI spacetime (allowing  = 0) has null rotation isotropy is considered. Direct calculation shows that imposing null rotation invariance on (37.106) of Stephani et al. (2003) leads (from (2.19) (v)) to 22 = 0, i.e. this case will not arise. With a zero Weyl tensor there is still full boost

14

M. A. H. MacCallum

and spatial rotation freedom: the boost can and will be used to set 22 = ±1, and if s = 1 the rotation will be used to make B imaginary.
Summarizing earlier arguments, (Bc) gives  = 0, (Bg, h and i) give  = 0 = ,
(Bf) and (Bk) imply that  is real,  = 22 and  = -2( + ¯). (2.18) (iii) then implies  + ¯ = 0 =  (so  is imaginary and  is an invariant), and  is constant. Thus t0 = 0. (Bd) implies that ¯ = 2¯ + 2, while (2.18) (iv) requires  + ¯ +  to be real. Thus  = 2( + ¯) is real. The imaginary part of (NPp) now implies
 = 0 or  - ¯ is real, so  and  are both real. If  =  + ¯ = 0, k is proportional to a covariantly constant vector, as in
Section 3.1, and the spacetime is a pp-wave with a G5. These cases have a 2dimensional LNRI group and are LRS so s1 = 3. They are the solutions (37.104)­(37.105) in Stephani et al. (2003).
If  = 0, ,  and  are all real and  +  = 0. Then (NPq) gives  = -2(2 - 2). The imaginary part of (NPc) implies  - ¯ = 0 so  is zero and  and  are invariants. Then (2.18) is satisfied. Since 23 =  22 = ± = 0, s1 = 1 = s.
Checking (A2), (2.19) (i)­(iv) are automatically satisfied. (2.19) (v) gives  + 3 = 0 so  = -3,  = -4 and  = - 2 = 0. Thus  ,  and  are constants. (2.14) holds so  is an invariant. (NPf) now gives (2.9) or equivalently (in this case)
(2.8), and (2.19) (vi) gives (2.10). So  + µ¯ and  + ¯ are invariants. Using (2.10), (NPo) and (NPr) now imply  and  + µ¯ are real, and  = -2 - 3( + µ¯).
(A3) is then satisfied. Since s0 = 3 and s1 = 1, conditions arising from (A4) might be required to
prove null rotation isotropy if t1 were zero. This would require  to be constant and  + µ¯ to be zero. With these conditions, (A4) is readily checked (using CLASSI). If  is not constant, t1 = 1. Among the second derivatives, only 244 = 12( + ¯) + 242 +  could contain another function of position. If it does, the Cartan-
Karlhede procedure terminates with p = 2 and tp = 2 and otherwise with p = 1 and tp = 1.

3.6 LNRI spacetimes with Ricci tensor of Segre type [1(11,1)]
In the Petrov type N case, the relations given in Section 2.3, and (2.12) and (2.14), which follow from (A1), together give (2.7). Hence whatever the value of 4, 4 = 0 and (Bc) then shows  is real. (Bg), (Bh) and (Bj) show -¯ is real and (2.9) and (2.8) are true. (Bf) implies +µ¯ is real. Thus (2.10) is true and +µ¯ and  + ¯ are invariants. Reality of  - ¯ and (2.14) give  - ¯ = -2( - ¯) = 2( - ¯). (A1), (A2) and (A3) are then satisfied. As s0 = 3 while s1 = 1, one must check if (A4) is needed to ensure null rotation isotropy. However, the conditions for t0 = t1 = 0 are very strong (, 11 , , ,  + ¯,  + ¯ and  + ¯ must be constants and  + µ¯ = 0), and with these conditions (A4) is satisfied. The spacetime has at least a G3.
In the conformally flat case, (A1) is again satisfied, as a consequence of the Bianchi identities, and from (Bd)  + ¯ = 0. (2.19) (i) and (vi) are then satisfied.
If (µ + ¯) = 0, then (2.19) (ii) and (iii) imply that  is real and  + 2 = 0, while (2.19) (iv) implies that 2 +  is real. As  - ¯ is invariant, the imaginary part of (NPd) added to the conjugate of (NPe) yields that  = 0. Then  is a null rotation invariant, so D = 0 in (NPa) which implies  =  =  = 0. Then (A3) is

Spacetimes with continuous linear isotropies III: null rotations

15

satisfied, and since t0  1 the Cartan-Karlhede procedure must terminate at p = 1
or p = 2. (A2) implies null rotation isotropy in this case. If (µ + ¯) = 0, no information arises from (A2). In this case, from (Bc, f
and k)  = 11 = 0. The only spin coefficient combination appearing in the symmetrized spinor derivatives of  is  + ¯ and its derivatives and (11 - ) = ( + ¯)11 (from (Bg, h and j)). Applying the [, ] commutator to (11 - ) gives ( + ¯) = 0. (A2) and (A3) are then satisfied. If t0 = t1 = 0, so 11 ,  and  + ¯ are constant, (A4) could be required to ensure the Cartan-Karlhede procedure terminates at p  3, but inspection shows that then t2 = 0 also, so the
Cartan-Karlhede procedure will terminate with p = 1. In this subcase only (A1) has been used, and only for directional derivatives of 11 and .

4 Conclusion
In this paper, it has been shown that the conjecture of Siklos, although not correct in general, as discussed in the introduction to Paper 1 of this series (MacCallum, 2021a), is correct in almost all cases with local null rotation invariance. Thus the following holds:
Theorem 1 Einstein spacetimes with a Weyl tensor of Petrov type N, spacetimes with a Ricci tensor of Segre type [(11, 2)], and conformally flat spacetimes with a Ricci tensor of Segre type [1(11, 1)], are locally null rotation isotropic if and only if their curvature tensor and its first two derivatives are locally null rotation invariant.
As explained in Section 2.1.4, these spacetimes might have exhibited a sequence of (si, ti) values requiring a check of the fourth derivatives of the curvature, but the detailed calculations show that this is never the case.
Theorem 2 A spacetime other than those covered by Theorem 1 is locally null rotation isotropic if and only if the curvature tensor and its first derivative are locally null rotation invariant.
All locally null rotation isotropic spacetimes admit a multiply-transitive Gr (r  3).

A Known spacetimes with null rotation invariance

Local invariance groups g containing both a null rotation and either rotational or boost symmetry are possible only in conformally flat spaces with Ricci tensors of Segre types [(11,2)] or [1(11,1)] or [(111,1)]. Such spacetimes were discussed in the previous papers (MacCallum, 2021a,b). So the only metrics to be considered in this paper are those where g consists solely of null rotations.
Spacetimes with a two-dimensional LNRI group have at least a G5 on an N3. These are included in the pp-waves discussed below. Spacetimes with a one-dimensional LNRI group must have a group of motions Gr with r  3. If r = 3 the group acts on a two-dimensional null surface N2. If r = 4 it acts on a three-dimensional hypersurface which may be null (N3) or timelike (T3). If r  5 but s = 1 the group acts on the whole spacetime. Groups G6 or larger which contain null rotation isotropy necessarily act on the whole spacetime.
The pp waves have the metric form

da2 = 2[-dudv - Hdu2 + dd¯], H = H(, ¯, u);

(A.1)

which is conformally flat only if H,¯¯ = 0. Of the energy-momenta considered in Stephani et al. (2003) only vacuum and pure radiation (including Einstein-Maxwell) solutions are possible, with  = 0. If tp = 0 the solutions are plane waves, which are special cases of (A.1), and there is a group G6 acting transitively on spacetime, or in even more special cases with additional symmetry, a G7 (see (24.46) and Section 12.2 in Stephani et al. (2003)).
The plane waves have s = 2. Expressing this in terms of transitivity on the set of possible wave surfaces enabled Hall (2015, 2019) to show the equivalence of two definitions of the plane wave subcases of (A.1). He also proved that transitivity on the wave surfaces leads back to the metric (A.9) or those plane waves found in Sections 3.1, 3.4 and 3.5 above. (See the cited papers for the detailed assumptions made.)
The metric (A.1) has at least a group G1 generated by k = v, but may admit a Gr with r = 2 to 7. The possible symmetry classes were studied by Sippel and Goenner (1986), without the use of the Einstein field equations. Those which have LNRI have (s, tp) = (2, 1) and a G5, or (s, tp) = (2, 0) and a G6, or s = 1. There are none with a maximal G4 so (s, tp) = (1, 1) does not arise. If (s, tp) = (1, 2), there is a G3 on N2 so these are included in (A.2) below. If (s, tp) = (1, 0) there is a G5.
The pp-waves with a G5 or G6 are listed as cases 9 to 15 in Table II in Sippel and Goenner (1986). Case 9 is a homogeneous pure radiation spacetime, (12.36) in Stephani et al. (2003). Case 10 is the only metric with a G5 on null hyperplanes and tp = 1: it is interpretable as an Einstein-Maxwell plane wave. Of those with a G6, cases 11-14 are pure radiation plane wave metrics, while case 15 is a vacuum solution of Einstein's equations. The formulae for these cases appear in the first paragraph of page 386 of Stephani et al. (2003), where  may be zero.
Note that despite claims to the contrary in the literature, repeated in Stephani et al. (2003) Section 24.5, all these pp-wave metrics with LNRI admit interpretations as Einstein-Maxwell spacetimes, although in one case (that given as (24.47) or equivalently (12.36) in Stephani et al. (2003)) the Maxwell field does not inherit the spacetime's symmetries (Torre, 2012).
The general metric with a G3 on N2 was given by Barnes (1979), who showed that it was equivalent to metric forms used earlier by Petrov and by Defrise. It can be written

ds2 = B2(x, u)[-2du dv + 2F (x, u)du2 + dy2] + dx2.

(A.2)

This has as (possibly) non-zero entries in AB exactly the components allowed in the canonical forms compatible with LNRI in which ABis not identically zero. In the null tetrad {B(dv - F du), Bdu, (dx - iBdy)/ 2, (dx + iBdy)/ 2} the curvature components are

Boosting from this frame to the frame with |4| = 1 used in the main text would in general

lead to more complicated formulae. The G3 is in general maximal but there are cases with a

Gr, r > 3, such as pp-waves, and spacetimes with a G4 on T3 (MacCallum, 1980).

Only if B,x = 0 can one have 11 = 02 =  = 0 in the metric (A.2), and then 12 = 0 and 22 + 4 = 0. 12 = 0 if and only if B is separable, taking the form B1(u)B2(x). If 11 = 02 = 0 then B = Y (u)eK(u)x where Y (u) and K(u) are functions of u alone; then

 = -K2/2. If  = 0 then B has the form Y (u) x + K(u), Y and K again being functions

of u. Spacetimes obeying one of 11 = 0, 12 = 0 or  = 0, with suitable F , may also obey 22 = 0 or 4 = 0.
Barnes considered the Einstein equations for (A.2) for a Ricci tensor of Segre type [(112)]

("pure radiation") with  = 0 and showed that all such spacetimes are pp-waves; they admit

a Maxwell field that inherits the LNRI symmetry only in the more special plane wave case (cf.

Section 3.4 above).

Barnes also found an Einstein space with the B = Y (u)eK(u)x form where K = C, a

constant, Y = 1/u and F = G(u)e-3Cx. The existence of this Einstein space and others

mentioned below shows that the assertion of Salazar I. et al. (1983) that nontwisting type N

spacetimes with a cosmological constant admit at most a G2 of isometries is mistaken. There are further Petrov type N Einstein spaces of the form (A.2) which Barnes overlooked. In these,

K = C and F = G(u)e-3Cx again, but Y (u) is constant, say 1. If G(u) is constant this

is Kaigorodov's solution ((12.34) and (38.2) in Stephani et al. (2003)), up to constant scale factors, and otherwise is the H = A(u)x3 solution for (A.8) below.

One can find further metrics for other Segre type, Weyl tensor, and  combinations, though

these are generally of less physical significance. Some examples are, by Segre type:

[(1,3)], Petrov N,  = 0; B = ux-1, F = 1.

Siklos (1985) introduced the class of Lobatchevski plane waves, which include the only

Einstein spaces conformal to pp-waves. The metrics can be written (omitting a constant factor

fixing an overall scale for the curvature) as

ds2 = [-2dudv - Hdu2 + (dx2 + dy2)]/x2, H = H(x, y, u).

(A.8)

They are of Petrov type N and have in general a pure radiation energy-momentum tensor (Segre type [(11,2)]), a constant negative  (so pp-waves are not possible), and in general only a G1 of isometries generated by v. Particular cases may admit a Gr, 2  r  6: the special H admitting these larger groups, and their associated Killing vectors, are listed in Table 1 of Siklos' paper. From that table, there is a one-parameter LNRI group only if H,y = 0. Under that condition the spacetime admits a G3 on N2 in general, a G4 on T3 if H is A(x), a G4 on N3 if A(u)x2 or u-2b-2A(xub) with constant b, a G5 on V4 if H = ±xa for constant a and a G6 on V4 if H = ±x-2. The last of these is Defrise's pure radiation solution with a cosmological constant, (12.6) in Stephani et al. (2003), i.e.

(A.9)

( here being the cosmological constant, not the Newman-Penrose .) If H = A(u)x3 in these cases the spacetime is an Einstein space, which when A is constant is Kaigorodov's solution, (38.2) in Stephani et al. (2003). The G5 of the Kaigorodov solution is maximal for type N Einstein spaces.
The possible metrics for a G4 acting on a null hypersurface N3 (not necessarily with LNRI) were found by Kruchkovich and Petrov. The list given in Petrov (1969), Section 32, has a few readily correctable misprints. It also includes two cases with non-Lorentzian signature, and one which (as noted by Petrov) does not allow a null hypersurface. Inspection of the remaining metrics shows that in most cases the isotropy in the given isometry group G4 is a spatial rotation rather than a null rotation.
These remaining metrics were considered further by Lauten and Ray (1977), who found no solutions of Einstein's equations for a range of possible energy-momenta in all but one case, but noted, without finding general-relativistic solutions, that three metrics admitted additional

18

M. A. H. MacCallum

Killing vectors. Two of these they denote by G4V I2 and G4V I4 in their table (page 885) but G4V I1 and G4V I2 on page 8865. One of those, (32.26) in Petrov's book, where it is labelled G4V I3 and also appears as (33.1) labelled G5A, admits a G5 on N3 and is a pp-wave in coordinates different from those of (A.1) above. The other, (32.27) or G4V I2 in the book, taking e = 1 to give the correct signature, is a special case of (32.26) with plane symmetry.
Lauten and Ray's one relativistic solution is for Petrov's G4I1 metric, which they give with misprints corrected. It is a pure radiation solution with an arbitrary 22 dependent on their (x1 - x4) and  = 0: they call it a null fluid with a cosmological constant. The metric is a special case of (A.2), as can be shown using the calculations in Barnes' paper, with an
additional translational Killing vector in the null hyperplane u = constant.
The possibilities for a group G4 with LNRI acting on a T3 were studied in MacCallum (1980), and are either special cases of (A.2) or have metrics of the form

ds2 = A2(z)[-2eydu(dv + B(z)ey du) + dy2] + dz2,

(A.10)

which appears as (13.19) in Stephani et al. (2003). Its Ricci tensor has Segre type [1(1,2)] or one of its degeneracies, and it is conformally flat only if B = 0 = 22 (Segre type [1(11,1)]. In that case 11 = (1 + 4(A,z 2 - AA,zz))/16A2.
Finally one could have a homogeneous spacetime with a group G5 acting transitively and including a null rotation isotropy, when s = 1 and tp = 0. Such metrics are known for an Einstein space, for pure radiation, and for a combination of these (see (12.34), (12.36) and (12.38) in Stephani et al. (2003)) but these examples are special cases of the other metrics above.
One can thus anticipate that assuming (Am) when g contains a null rotation invariance will lead to spacetimes whose metrics can be put in one of the forms (A.1), (A.2), (A.8), or (A.10). They may have Petrov type N or be conformally flat, and the Ricci tensors can be: for (A.1), [(11,2)]; for (A.2) any of those types considered above; for Siklos, only [(11,2)] with a non-zero ; and for (A.10), [1(1,2)] or [1(11,1)]. However, with Segre type [1(11,1)] where, unlike all those metrics,  need not be zero, there may be other possibilities.

B The Bianchi identities under LNRI
This appendix gives the Bianchi identities assuming, for the reasons discussed in Section 2.1, that the only components of the curvature which might be non-zero are 4, which is constant and such that |4| = 1, , and the real components 02 = 11 , 12 and 22 .
In more detail, only the following components of AB remain in the allowed Segre types: in [(1,3)], 12 ; in [1(1,2)], 211 = 02 and 22 ; in [(11,2)], 22 ; and in [1(11,1)], 211 = 02 . Since 02 , if non-zero, will be equal to 211 in the canonically chosen frames, that is assumed below.
For all curvature components, DQ = 0, and Q = ¯Q is real. Since under these conditions (Be) reads ( + ¯)11 = 0, that combination of terms has been eliminated from (Bb) and (Bi). The conditions (2.12) and (2.14) have been applied to terms involving 4.
