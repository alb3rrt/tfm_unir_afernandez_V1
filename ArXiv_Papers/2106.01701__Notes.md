## Abstract

We introduce a geometric approach of integral curves for functional inequalities involving directional derivatives in the general context of differentiable manifolds that are equipped with a volume form. We focus on Hardy-type inequalities and the explicit optimal Hardy potentials that are induced by this method. We then apply the method to retrieve some known inequalities and establish some new ones.
