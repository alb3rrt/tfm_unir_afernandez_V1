Abstract. The paper studies categories of definable subassignments with some category equivalences to semi-algebraic and constructible subsets of arc spaces of algebraic varieties. These materials allow us to compare the motivic measure of Cluckers-Loeser and the one of Denef-Loeser in certain classes of definable subassignments.

1. Introduction

Since it was invented by Kontsevich at the 1995 Orsay seminar, geometric motivic integra-

tion has attained a full development and has become one of the central objects of algebraic

geometry. From algebraic varieties to formal schemes, the development records contributions

of several authors, such as Denef-Loeser [7, 8], Sebag [18], Loeser-Sebag [14], Nicaise-Sebag

[16, 15], Nicaise [15]. Another point of view on motivic integration known as arithmetic mo-

tivic integration was developed almost at the same time, which works over only p-adic fields

(see [9]). Cluckers-Loeser's motivic integration [3, 4, 5], which was built on model theory with

respect to the Denef-Pas languages, is a general theory of motivic integration. It allows to

specialize to both of arithmetic and geometric points of view (see [10], [6], [1]). This theory

of motivic integration has an important application to the fundamental lemma (see [2]).

Recently, also using model theory with different languages, Hrushovski-Kazhdan [11] and

Hrushovski-Loeser [12] have extended geometric motivic integration to the arithmetic aspect,

with many interesting results and applications.

The present paper discusses the motivically measurable subassignments in the formalism of

Cluckers-Loeser for motivic integration [3, 4, 5], it also provides a comparison of their measure

with the classical motivic measure of Denef-Loeser [7, 8]. The ground field k considered will

be always a field of characteristic zero.

The language used in Cluckers-Loeser's motivic integration, LDP,P, has three sorts, with

the ring language for both valued field sort and residue field sort, and the Presburger language

for value group sort. Let Fieldk be the category of all fields K containing k in the LDP,P-

language. The corresponding theory admits each model to be a triple (K((t)), K, Z) with K

in Fieldk, which gives rise to a natural valuation map ordt : K((t))  Z and a natural angular component map ac : K((t))  K. A basic affine subassignment h[m, n, r] (or, in another

concerning definable subsassignments SDefk(LDP,P(k)), SDefk(X, LDP,P(k)), and RDefhS , in which LDP,P(k) is the sublanguage of LDP,P with all polynomials in both valued field sort and residue field sort having coefficients in k.
The category SDefk(LDP,P(k)) has objects to be small definable subassignments, which is comparable with the category of semi-algebraic subsets of the arc space of an algebraic k-
variety. When fixing an algebraic k-variety X we obtain the subcategory SDefk(X, LDP,P(k)) of SDefk(LDP,P(k)) whose objects are all the small definable subassignments of hX×kSpeck((t)). A main result of this paper is the following

Theorem 1 (Theorem 4.1). The categories SDefk(LDP,P(k)) and SAk are equivalent. If X is an algebraic k-variety, then the categories SDefk(X, LDP,P(k)) and SAk(X) are equivalent.

Let S be an affine k-variety, and let RDefhS be the subcategory each of whose objects

some n in N. In Section 2 we describe the category ConsS of constructible morphisms from

constructible sets over k to S in which a morphism in ConsS from X  S to Y  S is

determined uniquely up to S-isomorphism on X by the graph of an S-morphism X  Y .

This category ConsS has in fact the same Grothendieck ring with the category VarS. The

second main result of the paper is stated as follows.

Theorem 2 (Theorem 4.2). For any affine k-variety S, the categories RDefhS and ConsS are equivalent.

This theorem has several interesting corollaries, such as K0(RDefhS ) = K0(VarS). Thanks

to this isomorphism we can identify the class L of the trivial line bundle S ×k A1k  S with

the class

Moreover,

if

we have K0(RDefk)Z[L]A = Mloc. We also obtain the monodromic version of these identities, namely, K0µ^(RDef k) = K0µ^(Vark) and K0µ^(RDef k) Z[L] A = Mµl^oc.
Theorem 10.1.1 of [4] implies that there is a unique functor from the category of definable subassignments to the category of abelian groups, X  IC(X), which assigns to X  hSpeck a group morphism
µ : IC(X)  Mloc
satisfying the axioms A0-A8 in that theorem. By [4, Proposition 12.2.2], if a definable subassignment X of h[m, n, 0] is bounded (see Section 5.2), the characteristic function 1X will be in IC(X). In this case, µ(X) := µ(1X) in K0(RDefk) Z[L] A = Mloc is the motivic measure of X. When X is an invariant positively bounded definable subassignment of h[m, n, 0] we obtain the following comparison theorem (which also contains main results of the present paper).

Theorem 3 (Theorem 5.4, Proposition 5.6). Let X be an invariant definable subassignment of
h[m, n, 0] such that, for every (x, y) on X with x = (x1, . . . , xm), ordtxi  0 for all 1  i  m. With the notions vol defined in Lemma 5.3 and X[e] in the paragraph before Proposition 5.5, for e  N, the following identities hold:

µ(X) = loc(vol(X)) in Mloc, µ(X[e]) = loc(vol(X[e])) in Mµloec.
In fact, for X small in h[m, 0, 0], the paper [4] showed early that (µ(X)) = µ(X) in Mk, where  is the canonical morphism Mloc  Mk, µ is the Denef-Loeser motivic volume defined

in [8], and X is the semi-algebraic subset of L(Amk ) corresponding to X via the equivalence of categories between SAk(Amk ) and SDefk(Amk , LDP,P(k)) in Theorem 4.1.
In the end of this paper, we give a proof of the rationality of the series eN µ(X[e])T e in Mµl^oc[[T ]] with X an invariant positively definable subassignment of h[m, n, 0].

2. Grothendieck rings of varieties
Let k be a field of characteristic zero, and S an algebraic k-variety. As usual (cf. [7, 8]), we denote by VarS the category of S-varieties and K0(VarS) its Grothendieck ring. By definition, K0(VarS) is the quotient of the free abelian group generated by the S-isomorphism classes [X  S] in VarS modulo the following relation
[X  S] = [Y  S] + [X \ Y  S]
for Y being Zariski closed in X. Together with fiber product over S, K0(VarX) is a commutative ring with unity 1 = [Id : S  S]. Put
L = [A1k ×k S  S]
and write MS for the localization of K0(VarS) inverting L. Denote by MS,loc the localization of MS with respect to the multiplicative family generated by the elements 1 - L-n with n in N.
Let CVarS be the category whose objects are constructible morphisms from constructible sets over k to S such that the set of morphisms between objects X  S and Y  S is given by
MorCVarS (X  S, Y  S) := K0(VarX×SY ). In other words, a morphism from X  S to Y  S in CVarS is a finite sum of elements of the form [U  X ×S Y ] (in K0(VarX×SY )), with U being an algebraic k-variety. The composition of two basic morphisms [U  X ×S Y ] and [V  Y ×S Z] is the following morphism
[V  Y ×S Z]  [U  X ×S Y ] := [U ×Y V  X ×S Z].
This definition makes sense since the morphism U ×Y V  X ×S Z commutes with the structural morphisms to S, and it can be also extended by additivity. Clearly, the identity morphism of X in CVark is the class in K0(VarX×kX of the diagonal morphism X  X ×k X.
Denote by ConsS the subcategory of CVarS in which objects of ConsS are objects of CVarS and a morphism of ConsS from X  S to Y  S is an element
[(IdX , f ) : X  X ×S Y ]
in K0(VarX×SY ). By definition, each morphism of ConsS from X  S to Y  S is determined uniquely, up to S-automorphism on X, by the constructible S-morphism of constructible sets f : X  Y , or alternatively, by the graph of such an f . Using the above definition of Grothendieck ring for the category ConsS we get
K0(VarS) = K0(ConsS).
Let X be an algebraic k-variety, and let G be an algebraic group which acts on X. The G-action is called good if every G-orbit is contained in an affine open subset of X. Now we fix a good action of G on the k-variety S. By definition, the G-equivariant Grothendieck group K0G(VarS) of G-equivariant morphisms of k-varieties X  S, where X is endowed with a good G-action, is the quotient of the free abelian group generated by the G-equivariant isomorphism classes [X  S, ] modulo the following relations
[X  S, ] = [Y  S, |Y ] + [X \ Y  S, |X\Y ]

4

LE^ QUY THUONG

for Y being -stable Zariski closed in X, and
[X ×k Ank  S, ] = [X ×k Ank  S, ]
if  and  lift the same G-action on X to an affine action on X × Ank . As above, we have the commutative ring with unity structure on K0G(VarS) by fiber product, where G-action on the fiber product is through the diagonal G-action, and we may define the localization MGS of the ring K0G(VarS) by inverting L. In this article, we also consider the localization MGS,loc of MGS with respect to the multiplicative family generated by the elements 1 - L-n with n in N. When S is Speck, we shall write Mk instead of MSpeck, MGk instead of MGSpeck, Mloc instead of MSpeck,loc, and MGloc instead of MGSpeck,loc.
Since a constructible subset X of a k-variety is a finite disjoint union of locally closed subsets, we can endow X with good G-action via its locally closed subsets. A constructible morphism is G-equivariant if its graph admits a good G-action induced from the ones on its source and target. So we can define categories CVarGS and ConsGS as follows. As avove, fix a good G-action on the k-variety S. Objects of CVarGS are G-equivariant constructible morphisms from constructible sets endowed with a good G-action to S (over k), the set of morphisms between objects X  S and Y  S is

MorCVarGS (X  S, Y  S) := K0(VarGX×SY ). Objects of ConsGS are objects of CVarGS , and a morphism of ConsGS from X  S to Y  S is

[(Id, f ) : X  X ×S Y ] ,

where f : X  Y is a G-equivariant constructible S-morphism of constructible sets. Similarly
as previous, we can define the G-equivariant Grothendieck ring K0(ConsGS ) in the usual way, and obtain a canonical isomorphism of rings

K0G(VarS) = K0(ConsGS ).

Let µ^ be the group scheme of roots of unity, which is the projective limit of group schemes µn = Speck[t]/(tn - 1) together transitions µmn  µn induced by   m. A good µ^-action on an S-variety X is a good µn-action on the S-variety X for some n in N. We define

and Clearly, we have the identity

K0µ^(VarS) = l-im K0µn (VarS)

MµS^ = K0µ^(VarS ) L-1 .

3. Arc spaces and rational series

3.1. Arc spaces. Let X be an algebraic k-variety. For e  N, let Le(X) be the space of e-jet schemes of X, which is actually a k-scheme representing the functor sending a k-algebra A to the set of morphisms of k-schemes
Spec(A[t]/(te+1))  X.

Thus, the set of A-rational points of Le(X) is naturally identified with the set of A[t]/(te+1)-
rational points of X. For d  e in N, the truncation modulo te+1 induces an affine morphism of k-schemes

Ld(X)  Le(X)

GROTHENDIECK RINGS AND MEASURABLE SUBASSIGNMENTS

denoted by ed. If X is a smooth variety of dimension d, the morphism ed is a locally trivial

fibration

with

fiber

A(d-e) dimk
k

X.

The above jet schemes Le(X) and truncation morphisms ed form in a natural way a pro-

jective system of k-schemes. As the truncation morphisms are affine, the projective limit of

this system exists in the category of k-schemes and is called arc space of X and denoted by

L(X) with truncation morphisms

e : L(X)  Le(X).

If k  K is a field extension of k, then the K-rational points of L(X) correspond one-to-one
to the K[[t]]-rational points of X.
Recall from [8, Section 2], for any algebraically closed field K containing k, that a subset of K((t))m × Zr is semi-algebraic if it is a finite boolean combination of sets of the forms

(3.1)

{(x, )  K((t))m × Zr | ordtf (x)  ordtg(x) + ()} ,

and

(3.2)

{(x, )  K((t))m × Zr | ordtf (x)  () mod n} ,

and

(3.3)

{(x, )  K((t))m × Zr | (ac(f1(x)), . . . , ac(fm(x))) = 0} ,

where f , g, fi and  are k-polynomials,  is a Z-polynomial of degree at most 1, n is in N, and ac(fi(x)) is the angular component of fi(x). One calls a collection of formulas defining a semi-algebraic set a semi-algebraic condition. A subset A of L(X) is called semi-algebraic if there exists a covering of X by affine Zariski open sets U such that A  L(U ) is of the form

(3.4)

A  L(U ) = {x  L(U ) | (f1(x~), . . . , fm(x~); )},

where fi are regular functions on U ,  is a semi-algebraic condition,  may be a given tuple of integers or nothing, and x~ is the element in L(U )(k(x)) corresponding to a point x in L(U ) of residue field k(x).
By [17], if g : X  Y is a morphism of algebraic k-varieties and A is a semi-algebraic subset of L(X), then g(A) is a semi-algebraic subset of Y . Then the map g : A  g(A) is called a semi-algebraic morphism of semi-algebraic sets. More generally, let A and B be semi-algebraic subsets of L(X) and L(Y ), the arc spaces of k-varieties X and Y , respectively, and let h : A  B be a map. Then h is called a semi-algebraic morphism if its graph is a semi-algebraic subset of L(X ×k Y ). Denote by SAk be the category whose objects are pairs (A, L(X)), where A is a semi-algebraic subset of the arc space L(X) of an algebraic k-variety X, and a morphism of SAk between two objects (A, L(X)) and (B, L(Y )) is a semi-algebraic morphism of semi-algebraic sets A  B. For a given k-variety X, we can consider the full subcategory SAk(X) of SAk consists of semi-algebraic subsets of L(X).
In the sense of [8, Definition-Proposition 3.2], Denef-Loeser's motivic volume is defined on ObSAk(X) the set of all the semi-algebraic subsets of L(X) with the reasonable properties. By [4, Remark 16.3.2], this motivic volume essentially takes values in Mloc. In the present article, we denote Denef-Loeser's motivic volume by µ (the symbol µ will be devoted to indicate Cluckers-Loeser's motivic volume [4]).

3.2. Rationality. Let M be a commutative ring with unity containing L and L-1, and let M[[T ]] be the set of formal power series in T with coefficients in M, which is a ring and also

6

LE^ QUY THUONG

a M-module with respect to usual operations for series. Denote by M[[T ]]sr the submodule of M[[T ]] generated by 1 and by finite products of terms

LpT q (1 - LpT q)

for (p, q) in Z × N. An element of M[[T ]]sr is called a rational series. By [7], there exists a unique M-linear morphism

lim
T 

:

M[[T

]]sr



M

such that for any (p, q) in Z × N,

lim
T 

(1

LpT q - LpT q)

=

-1.

We recall some examples on the rationality. Let X be a smooth algebraic k-variety of pure dimension m, and let f : X  A1k be a regular function with nonempty zero locus X0. For e in N, we put

X[e] =   Le(X) | f () = te mod te+1 ,

which is naturally an X0-variety and stable under the action  · (t) := (t) of µe on Le(X).

Write simply

X [e]

for the class

X[e]  X0

in

Mµe
X0

.

It

is

proved

in

[7]

that

the

series

Zf (T ) :=

X[e] L-emT e,

eN

is a rational series, i.e., in MµX^ 0[[T ]]sr. More general, we can obtain the rationality of a series generalizing Zf (T ) without assuming that X is smooth, and with f concerning several semialgebraic subsets in L(X). Let µ be Denef-Loeser's motivic volume defined in [8]. The below theorem is a result given in [13, Proposition 4.6].

Theorem 3.1 (L^e-Nguyen [13]). Let X be a k-variety and f a regular function on X. Let A,  in Nr, be a semi-algebraic family of semi-algebraic subsets of L(X) such that, for every
covering of X by affine open subsets U , A  L(U ) is a finite boolean combination of sets of the forms (3.1) and (3.2). Assume that, for every  in Nr, A is stable in the sense of [8] and disjoint with L(XSing). For e  N, we put

Ae, :=   A | f () = te mod te+1 .

Let  be a rational polyhedral convex cone in Rr+01 and ¯ its closure. Let  and  be integral linear forms on Zr+1 with (e, ) > 0 and (e, )  0 for all (e, ) in ¯ \ {0}. Then the formal power series

Z(T ) :=

µ (Ae,) L-(e,)T (e,)

(e,)Nr+1

is an element of Mµk^[[T ]]sr, and the limit limT  Z(T ) is independent of such an  and .

4. Categories of definable subassignments
In this section, we recall some concepts and results on motivic integration in the sense of Cluckers-Loeser [4]. We also provide an equivariant version for objects concerning definable subassignments.

GROTHENDIECK RINGS AND MEASURABLE SUBASSIGNMENTS

4.1. Definable subassignments. We consider the formalism of Cluckers and Loeser [4] with a concrete Denef-Pas language LDP,P consisting of the ring language LRings = {+, -, ·, 0, 1} for valued fields, also the ring language LRings for residue fields, and the Presburger language LPR for value groups, where
LPR = {+, -, 0, 1, }  {n| n  N} ,
and n is the equivalence relation modulo n. Let Fieldk be the category of all fields K containing k in the LDP,P-language, where sentences take coefficients in k and k((t)), and morphisms of Fieldk are field morphisms. The theory corresponding to Fieldk states that K((t)) are valued fields with residue field K and value group Z, endowed with order map

ordt : K((t))  Z  {+},

with convention ordt(0) = +, and with angular component map

ac : K((t))  K,

with ac(0) = 0.

For a basic set

V := Amk((t)) × Ank × Zr,

with m, n, r in N, we consider the functor hV (also denoted by h[m, n, r]) from Fieldk to the category of sets defined by

hV (K) = h[m, n, r](K) := K((t))m × Kn × Zr.

If X is a map sending each object K of Fieldk to a subset X(K) of K((t))m × Kn × Zr, then X is called a affine subassignment (or, shortly speaking, subassignment) of hV = h[m, n, r]. Note

that X is not necessarily a subfunctor of h[m, n, r]. In the same way, we can define morphisms

of subassignments and their graph, as well as union, subtraction, Cartesian product and fiber

product of two subassignments.

A subassignment X of h[m, n, r] is called definable if there exists a formula  in LDP,P

with k((t))-coefficients and m free variables in the valued field sort, k-coefficients and n free

variables in residue field sort, and r free variables in the value group sort, such that, for any

K in Fieldk,

X(K) = {x  K((t))m × Kn × Zr | (K((t)), K, Z) |= (x)} .

In this setting, we also write h for the definable subassignment X. Denote by  the empty definable subassignment, with (K) =  for any K in Fieldk. For X and X being definable subassignments of h[m, n, r] and h[m, n, r], respectively, a definable morphism X  X is a morphism of subassignments X  X such that its graph is a definable subassignment of h[m + m, n + n, r + r].
For a set
W := X × X × Zr,

with X an algebraic k((t))-variety, and X an algebraic k-variety, we define

hW (K) := X (K((t))) × X(K) × Zr,

for any K in Fieldk. In general, we can define definable subassignments of hW , definable morphisms of definable subassignments, and usual operations on definable subassignments of functors of the form hW using a glueing procedure (as in [4, Section 2.3]): taking finite covers (always exist) of X and X by affine open k((t))-subvarieties and k-subvarieties, respectively,
going back to the definition of affine definable subassignment, and glueing them.

8

LE^ QUY THUONG

We consider the category Defk(LDP,P) (or Defk for short) of affine definable subassignments, where its objects are pairs (X, h[m, n, r]) with X being a definable subassignment of h[m, n, r], and a morphism
(X, h[m, n, r])  (X, h[m, n, r])
in Defk(LDP,P) is a definable morphism X  X. We also consider the category GDefk(LDP,P) (or GDefk for short) of global definable subassignments, where objects of GDefk(LDP,P) are pairs (X, hW ) with hW as above and X being a definable subassignment of hW , and a morphism
(X, hW )  (X, hW  )
in GDefk(LDP,P) is a definable morphism X  X. For any affine definable subassignment S, we denote by DefS(LDP,P) (or DefS for short) the category of morphisms X  S in Defk, and a morphism in DefS(LDP,P) between X  S and X  S is a morphism X  X in Defk which is compatible with the morphisms to S. For any definable subassignment S, the category GDefS(LDP,P) (or GDefS for short) can be defined in the same way as GDefk with hSpeck replaced by S.

4.2. Points on definable subassignments. Let X be an object in GDefk. A point x on X is a tuple x = (x0, K) such that K is in Fieldk and x0 is in X(K). For such a point x on X we usually write k(x) for K and call it the residue field of x. Let
f :XY
be a morphism in Defk, with X = (X0, h[m, n, r])
and Y = (Y0, h[m, n, r]),
whose graph is defined by a formula (x, y), where x is in h[m, n, r] and y is in h[m, n, r]. One defines the fiber of f over a point y = (y0, k(y)) on Y to be the definable subsassignment Xy in Defk(y) given by the formula (x, y0). In the category GDefk, fibers of a morphism are defined in the same way by using affine covers.

4.3. Categories SDefk(LDP,P(k)), SDefk(X, LDP,P(k)), and RDefhS . Let LDP,P(k) denote the sublanguage of LDP,P which consists of formulas in LDP,P with coefficients in both valued field and residue field sorts lying in k. Let X be an algebraic k-variety, let
X := X ×k Speck((t)),
and A a definable subassignment of hX defined by a formula LDP,P(k). Assume first X is a closed subscheme in Amk((t)), for some m in N, such that the ideal defining X generated by polynomials with coefficients in k[[t]]. The above mentioned definable subassignment A (i.e., defined by a formula in LDP,P(k)) is called small if A is contained in the following definable subassignment
{(x1, . . . , xm)  h[m, 0, 0] | ordtxi  0, 1  i  m} .
For X not necessarily affine, we call A small if there exists a cover of X by open affine k((t))subvarieties Ui defined by the vanishing of polynomials with coefficients in k[[t]] such that A  hUi are small for all i. Let SDefk(LDP,P(k)) be the subcategory of GDefk whose objects are pairs
(A, hX×kSpeck((t))),

GROTHENDIECK RINGS AND MEASURABLE SUBASSIGNMENTS

where X is an algebraic k-variety and A is a small definable subassignment of hX×kSpeck((t)), and a morphism in SDefk(LDP,P(k)) between objects

(A, hX×kSpeck((t)))
and
(B, hY ×kSpeck((t)))
is a morphism of subassignments A  B such that its graph is a small definable subassignment of hX×kY ×kSpeck((t)).
Fixing an algebraic k-variety X, we define a category denoted by SDefk(X, LDP,P(k)) which is the full subcategory of SDefk(LDP,P(k)) whose objects contain all the small definable subassignments of hX×kSpeck((t)).

Theorem 4.1. The categories SDefk(LDP,P(k)) and SAk are equivalent. Moreover, if X is an algebraic k-variety, then the categories SDefk(X, LDP,P(k)) and SAk(X) are equivalent.

Proof. At the moment, for short, we write (A, X) instead of (A, hX×kSpeck((t))) for an object of SDefk(LDP,P(k)), and (A, X) instead of (A, L(X)) for an object in of SAk.
First, let us construct a functor F from SDefk(LDP,P(k)) to SAk. Let (A, X) be an object of SDefk(X, LDP,P(k)), where X is of k-dimension n. Then, there is a cover of X ×k Speck((t)) by Zariski open affine k((t))-subvarieties U , with U embedded as a closed k((t))-subvariety in some Amk((t)) (we can take m common for all U ) and the embedding defined over k[[t]], such that for coordinates xi of h[m, 0, 0] and any point x on A  hU we have ordtxi(x)  0. We can choose xi such that xi are standard coordinate components of h[m, 0, 0] for 1  i  n, and
that hU is defined by the vanishing of xi for n + 1  i  m. Note that A  hU is defined by a
formula (x, ) in the language LDP,P(k), where x = (x1, . . . , xm) are free variables in valued
field sort, and  = (1, . . . , r) are free variables in value group sort, namely,

A  hU = {x  hU | (x1(x), . . . , xn(x), 0, . . . , 0, )} .

By Denef-Pas' quantifier elimination theorem (cf. Corollary 2.1.2 of [4]), (x, ) is equivalent to a finite disjunction of formulas of the form

(acg1(x), . . . , acgn(x))  (ordtf1(x), . . . , ordtfn(x), ),

where fi and gj are polynomials over k,  is an LRings-formula with coefficients in k, and  is an LPR-formula. Thus, as seen in (3.1), (3.2) and (3.3), the formula  is nothing but a semi-algebraic condition.
Since U is embedded over k[[t]] into Amk((t)), there exists a unique closed k-subvariety U in Amk such that
U = U ×k Speck((t)),

hence we have a cover {U } of X by Zariski open affine k-subvarieties. The above xi induce

regular 1i

functions xi n, and that

on U such that U is defined by

xi the

coordinate components in xi for n + 1  i  m. Now

Amk we

for put

every

AU := x  L(U ) | (x1(x~), . . . , xn(x~), 0, . . . , 0, ) ,

where x~ is defined after (3.4), and glue AU 's into a semi-algebraic subset A of L(X). Note that the construction of A is up to semi-algebraic isomorphism independent of the choice of the cover {U }. Let us define

F(A, X) = (A, X),

which is an object in SAk.

10

LE^ QUY THUONG

We shall construct a morphism F(f) in SAk which is the image under F of a morphism f in SDefk(LDP,P(k)) such that
F(g  f) = F(g)  F(f).
It suffices to consider the case where f is either an inclusion or a projection of small definable subassignments, and to check the preserving property for composition of such two kinds of morphisms.
Consider the B-projection

prB : (A × B, X ×k Y )  (B, Y ),

a morphism in SDefk(LDP,P(k)). Then the graph of prB is Graph(prB) := {(a, b, b)  A × B × B} ,

which is a small definable subassignments of hX×kY ×kY ×kSpeck((t)). Put (A, X) := F(A, X), (B, Y ) := F(B, Y ),

hence (A × B, X ×k Y ) = F(A × B, X ×k Y ),
and (D, X ×k Y ×k Y ) := F(Graph(prB), X ×k Y ×k Y ).
Then D is a semi-algebraic subset of

A × B × B  L(X ×k Y ×k Y ) = L(X) ×k L(Y ) ×k L(Y ).

By construction, we get

D = {(x, y, y)  A × A × B} .

Then we define F(prB) := prB : A × B  B,
the B-projection, which is a morphism in SAk. Similarly, if
i : (A, X)  (B, X)

is a morphism in SDefk(LDP,P(k)) induced by an inclusion A  B of small definable subassignments, then we define F(i) by

F(i)(x) = x.

Let i : (C, X ×k Y )  (A × B, X ×k Y )

be a morphism in SDefk(LDP,P(k)), where C  A × B is an inclusion. Then there exist

a definable subset (A1 × A1, X ×k Y )

A1 are

of A and a definable subset objects of SDefk(LDP,P(k)),

B1 of B and that

such C =

that A1 ×

(A1, X), (B1, Y ) and B1. By construction,

we have

F(prB  i) = F(prB)  F(i).

In the same way, if

j : (B, Y )  (E, Y )

is a morphism in SDefk(LDP,P(k)), where B  E is the inclusion, then it is obvious that

F(j  prB) = F(j)  F(prB).

We now construct a functor G from SAk to SDefk(LDP,P(k)) which is naturally inverse to F. Let (A, X) be an object of SAk, i.e., A is a semi-algebraic subset of L(X). By definition, there exist a cover of X by Zariski open affine k-subvarieties V (viewed as a closed k-subvariety

GROTHENDIECK RINGS AND MEASURABLE SUBASSIGNMENTS

11

of Amk ), and for each V , regular functions hi on V , 1  i  m, a semi-algebraic condition  (with hi and  depending on V ) such that
A  L(V ) = {x  L(V ) | (h1(x~), . . . , hm(x~), )} .
We can choose hi such that V is defined by the vanishing of hi for n + 1  i  m. Clearly,
V := V ×k Speck((t)) is embedded over k[[t]] into Amk((t)), and they form a cover of X ×k Speck((t)). Note that  is a formula in LDP,P(k), and that hi induce definable morphism of definable subassignments
xi : hV  h[1, 0, 0].
Put AV = {x  hV | (x1(x), . . . , xn(x), 0, . . . , 0, ), ordtxi(x)  0, 1  i  m} ,
and glue all AV along the cover {V} of X ×k Speck((t)) to get a small definable subassignment A of hX×kSpeck((t)). We can prove that the construction of A is up to definable isomorphism independent of the choice of the cover {V }. So we can define
G(A, X) = (A, X),
which is an object of SDefk(LDP,P(k)). Similarly, we can define G(f ) to be a morphism of SDefk(LDP,P(k)) when f is a morphism of SAk, which satisfies
G(f  g) = G(f )  G(g).

The existence of natural isomorphisms
 : F  G  IdSAk
and  : IdSDefk(LDP,P(k))  G  F
follows from the fact that the construction of A from A and vice versa is independent of the choice of covers by open affine subvarieties.

Let S be a definable subassignment in GDefk. We denote by RDefS the full subcategory of

GDefS such that each object X  S of RDefS is the S-projection of a definable subassignment

X of S × hAn, for some n in N. k

We first mention a special case when S = hS as follows.

Let S be a closed k-subvariety of Adk, for a given d in N. Then the category RDefhS defined

previously is just the full subcategory of DefhS , its objects X  hS are the hS-projection of

definable

subassignments

X

of

hS×k

,

with

Theorem 4.2. For any affine variety S, the categories RDefhS and ConsS are equivalent.

Proof. Using the argument in [4, Section 16.2], under some elimination theorems, we have that objects of Defk are defined by formulas without quantifiers in the Denef-Pas language LDP,P. Since Chevalley's constructibility theorem in algebraic geometry (over k) is nothing else than the quantifier elimination theorem for the theory of algebraically closed fields containing k, a formula defining a definable subassignment of hS×kAnk defines a constructible subset of S ×k Ank , and via graph, a definable morphism of definable subassignments gives rise to a constructible morphism of constructible sets, and vice versa. For a detailed argument, we can use the strategy in the proof of Theorem 4.1.

4.4. Actions. Let X be an algebraic k-variety, and G an algebraic group over k. A G-action (or hG-action) on hX is a definable morphism of definable subassignments
hG×kX  hX
such that the corresponding morphism of k-varieties

G ×k X  X
is a G-action on X. The G-action on hX is called good if the corresponding G-action on X is good. In this setting, a definable morphism of definable subassignments

hX  hY is G-equivariant if the corresponding morphism of k-varieties

X Y

is G-equivariant. By Theorem 4.2, we can extend this definition of good G-action to that on

any definable subassignment of h[0, n, 0], for n in N. Let S be a closed k-subvariety of Adk, and

let S

be endowed with a good G-action.

Denote

Lemma

4.3.

For

S,

the

categories

RDef

G hS

and

ConsGS

are

equivalent.

Proof. The lemma is deduced directly from Theorem 4.2 and the definition of good G-action on definable subassignments.

For an algebraic k((t))-variety X , the definable subassignment hX admits a natural µn-action hµn × hX  hX induced by
(, t)  t,
for all n in N. More precisely, for every K in Fieldk,  in µn(K) and (t) in X (K((t))), we have
 · (t) = (t).
The profinite group scheme µ^ acts naturally on hX via µn for some n in N.

4.5. Grothendieck semirings and rings. Let S be a definable subassignment. According to [4], the Grothendieck semigroup SK0(RDefS) of the category RDefS) is the quotient of the free abelian semigroup generated by symbols [X  S] with X  S being objects in RDefS modulo the following relations:
[  S] = 0,
[X  S] = [Y  S]
if X  S and Y  S are isomorphic in RDefS, and
[X  Y  S] + [X  Y  S] = [X  S] + [Y  S]

for definable subassignments X and Y of S × hAnk , for some n in N, and morphisms of X and Y to S factorizing through S-projection. Denote by K0(RDefS) the group associated to the Grothendieck semigroup SK0(RDefS). If we provide SK0(RDefS) and K0(RDefS) with a product induced by the fiber product over S of morphisms of subassignments to S defined

GROTHENDIECK RINGS AND MEASURABLE SUBASSIGNMENTS

13

in Section 2.2 of [4], then they are commutative semiring and ring with unity, respectively. Remark that the canonical morphism

SK0(RDefS)  K0(RDefS)

is not necessarily injective. Let S be a k-variety endowed with a given G-action. The G-equivariant Grothendieck group
K0G(RDefhS ) is the quotient of the free abelian group generated by symbols
[X  hS, ]

with

[X  hS, ] = [Y  hS , ]

if there exists a G-equivariant definable morphism X  Y which commutes with the definable morphisms to hS,

[X  hS, ] = [Y  hS, |Y] + [X \ Y  hS , |X\Y] for Y being -stable definable subassignment of X, and

if  and  lift the same G-action on X to an affine action on X × hAm k , for any m  0. As above, with respect to fiber product of subassignments endowed with diagonal G-action, the

group K0G(RDefhS ) is a commutative rings with unity.

Lemma 4.4. For any k-variety S, there are canonical isomorphisms K0(RDefhS ) = K0(VarS)
and K0G(RDefhS ) = K0G(VarS).

Proof. This statement is a direct corollary of Theorem 4.2 and Lemma 4.3. We can also refer to [4, Section 16.2] for a proof of the first isomorphism.

5. Integrable functions and measurable subassignments

5.1. Rings of motivic functions and Functions. Let S be a definable subassignment. Put

A := Z L, L-1,

1 1 - L-n

,
nN

where by abuse of notation L also stands for the class of S × hA1k in K0(RDefS). By [4], for any real number q > 1, there is a unique morphism of rings

vq : A  R
sending L to q, and such that, whenever q is transcendental, vq is injective. Denote by A+ the subset of A consisting of elements a with vq(a)  0.
We now recall Section 4.6 of [4]. Denote by |S| the set of points of S. Let P(S) be the subring of the ring of functions |S|  A which is generated by constant functions

|S|  A,

by functions

~ : |S|  Z,

14

LE^ QUY THUONG

and by functions

L~ : |S|  A,

for definable morphisms ,  : S  hZ = h[0, 0, 1]. Here, notice that to any definable morphism
 : S  h[0, 0, 1]

corresponds a function

~ : |S|  Z.

Denote by P+(S) the semiring of functions in P(S) with values in A+. In particular, the ring P(hSpeck) and the semiring P+(hSpeck) are nothing but A and A+, respectively. Denote by P0(S) the subring of P(S) which is generated by L - 1 and by character functions 1X for all
definable subassignments X of S, and also define

P0+(S) := P0(S)  P+(S).

According to [4, Section 5.3], the semiring C+(S) of positive constructible motivic functions on S and the ring C(S) of constructible motivic functions on S are defined as follows

(5.1)

C+(S) := SK0(RDef S) P0+(S) P+(S), C(S) := K0(RDefS) P0(S) P(S).

If S is an algebraic k-variety endowed with a good µ^-action, we define

Cµ^(hS ) := K0µ^(RDef hS ) P0(hS) P(hS ).
In the rest of the article we will not work with this ring Cµ^(hS), except the trivial case when S = Speck. For this case, we have the following lemma, which is is obvious from the definition.

Lemma 5.1. There exist canonical isomorphisms

C+(hSpeck) = SK0(RDef k) N[L-1] A+,

C(hSpeck) = Mloc

and

Cµ^(hSpeck) = Mµl^oc.

The important properties of C+(S) and C(S) are given in Section 5 of [4]. According to [4, Section 3], the K-dimension of a definable subassignment (with K a capital
letter not a mathematical notation) is defined as follows. If S is a definable subassignment of hX , with X being an algebraic k((t))-variety, then the K-dimension of S, denoted by KdimS, is the dimension of the k((t))-variety which is the intersection of all k((t))-subvarieties Y of X with hY containing S. It may happen that the intersection is empty; in that case, we define

KdimS := -.

If S is a definable subassignment of hX ×X×Zr , with X as above and X being a k-variety, then we define
KdimS := Kdimpr1(S), where
pr1 : hX ×X×Zr  hX is the first projection.
A positive constructible motivic function  in C+(S) is called of K-dimension  d if  is a finite sum i i1Si in C+(S) such that the K-dimension of every Si is  d. Let C+d(S) be the sub-semigroup of C+(S) of elements of K-dimension  d, and
C+d (S) := C+d(S)/C+d-1(S)

GROTHENDIECK RINGS AND MEASURABLE SUBASSIGNMENTS

15

and C+(S) := C+d (S).
d0
An element in C+(S) is called a positive constructible motivic Function on S (with the capital letter F). Clearly, C+(S) is a graded abelian semigroup and has a module structure over the semiring C+(S) (cf. [4, Section 6]).
5.2. Integrable positive Functions and measurable subassignments. Let S be in Defk. By [4, Theorem 10.1.1], there exists a unique functor ISC+ from the category DefS to the category of abelian semigroups which sends every morphism
f :XY
in DefS to a morphism of semigroups
f! : ISC+(X)  ISC+(Y)
and satisfies the axioms A0­A8. If S = hSpeck we write IC+(X) instead of ISC+(X), and call it the semigroup of integrable positive Functions on X. By Proposition 12.2.2 of [4], if X is a definable subassignment of h[m, n, 0] which is bounded, i.e., there exists an s  N such that X is contained in the subassignment of h[m, n, 0] defined by
ordtxi  -s
for all 1  i  m, then [1X] belongs to IC+(X), where 1X is the characteristic function on X. (In the previous definition of boundedness, if s = 0 then X is said to be positively bounded.) If, in addtion, X = hSpeck, we have
IC+(hSpeck) = C+(hSpeck) = SK0(RDef k) N[L-1] A+.
Also in the trivial case S = hSpeck, let us take f to be the projection of X onto the final subassignment hSpeck of Defk. We denote by µ the morphism of semigroups f!, namely,
µ : IC+(X)  IC+(hSpeck) = SK0(RDef k) N[L-1] A+.
As mentioned previously, if X is a bounded definable subassignment in Defk, then [1X] is in IC+(X). In this case, we call X a motivically measurable (definable) subaasignment. We define the motivic measure of X to be
µ(X) := µ([1X]),
which lies in SK0(RDefk) N[L-1] A+ (see [4, Section 10.2]). Taking the composition of µ with the canonical morphism
SK0(RDef k) N[L-1] A+  K0(Vark) Z[L] A = Mloc,
we get the motivic measure of a bounded definable subassignment X in Defk with value in Mloc, which is by abuse of notation also denoted by µ(X). By the additivity of the integral (Axiom A2 in [4, Theorem 10.1.1]), the motivic measure µ is additive on bounded definable subassignments.
Denote by Mk the completion of Mk in the sense of [8], and by  the canonical morphism Mloc  Mk defined by the expansion of 1 - L-n, for every n in N.
Proposition 5.2. Let X be an algebraic k-variety, A a semi-algebraic subset of L(X), and A the small definable subassignment corresponding to A via the equivalence of categories between SAk(X) and SDefk(X, LDP,P(k)) in Theorem 4.1. Then
(µ(A)) = µ(A),

16

LE^ QUY THUONG

where µ is Denef-Loeser's motivic volume defined in [8].
Proof. Note that if a definable function
 : A  hZ
in the language LDP,P(k) is the zero function on A, then the semi-algebraic function
~ : A  Z
corresponding to  via the equivalence of categories between SAk(X) and SDefk(X, LDP,P(k)) in Theorem 4.1 is also the zero function on A. Now applying Theorem 16.3.1 of [4] to  = 0 we get the proposition.
5.3. Invariant definable subassignments and their measure. Let m, n be in N, and  = (1, . . . , m) in Zm. A definable subassignment X of h[m, n, 0] is called -invariant if, for every K in Fieldk, (a, b) and (x, y) in
h[m, n, 0](K) = K((t))m × Kn
satisfying ordtxi  i
for 1  i  m, both elements (a, b) and (a, b) + (x, y) are simultaneously in either X(K) or in the complement of X(K) in K((t))m × Kn. A definable subassignment of h[m, n, 0] is called invariant if it is -invariant for some  in Zm. In the case i =   Z for all 1  i  m, we write -invariant instead of -invariant. Note that if X is -invariant and i  i for all 1  i  m, then X is also (1 , . . . , m )-invariant. It is a fact that any bounded definable subassignment of h[m, 0, 0] closed in the valuation topology is -invariant for some  in Zm.
Now, let  be in N, and let X be a bounded definable subassignment of h[m, n, 0] with ordtxi  0 for every x = (x1, . . . , xm) on X and for all 1  i  m. Then X is -invariant if and only if there exists a constructible subset X of
Akm ×k Ank = L-1(Amk ) × Ank such that, for every K in Fieldk,
X(K) = ((K))-1 (X(K)) ,
which is the pullback of X(K) under the canonical map (K) : K[[t]]m × Kn  K[t]/(t) m × Kn = Km × Kn.
Indeed, we can show this by observing that, for K in Fieldk, every fiber of the restriction (K) is definably bijective to the set (t)K[[t]]m. The maps (K) induce the canonical morphism
 : h[m, n, 0]  h[0, m + n, 0], and X is -invariant if and only if there exists a constructible subset X  Akm ×k Ank such that X = -1(hX ). By abuse of notation, we shall denote the canonical morphism X  hX by . Lemma 5.3. Let    be in N, let X and X be as previous. Then the identity
[hX ] = [hX ]L(-)m holds in K0(RDefk) = K0(Vark). Consequently, the element
vol(X) := [hX ]L-(+1)m in K0(RDefk)[L-1] = Mk is independent of the choice of sufficiently large .

Along

this

map,

X is the preimage of X . Thus we get the identity [hX ] = [hX ]L(-)m in K0(RDefk).

Theorem 5.4. Let X be an invariant bounded definable subassignment of h[m, n, 0] such that, for every (x, y) on X with x = (x1, . . . , xm), ordtxi  0 for all 1  i  m. Then the identity

µ(X) = loc(vol(X))

holds in K0(RDefk) Z[L] A = Mloc.

Proof. Assume that X is -invariant, for some  in N. For k((t))-coordinates (x1, . . . , xm) in X, let us write
xi = ai0 + ai1t + · · · + ai,-1t-1 + · · · , 1  i  m.
Consider the inclusion i : h[m, n, 0]  h[m, m + n, 0]

given by (x, y)  (x, (ai0, ai1, . . . , ai,-1)1im, y), and the projection

pr : h[m, m + n, 0]  h[0, m + n, 0]

given by (x, z)  z. Denote by iX the restriction of i on X. We can regard iX as an inclusion

iX : X  X[0, m, 0].

Denote by prX the restriction of pr on X[0, m, 0]. Then the composition prX  iX is nothing
but the canonical map  : X  hX . By the functoriality (Axiom A0) of the integral in [4, Theorem 10.1.1] we have ()! = (prX)!  (iX)!, hence

( )! 1X = (prX)! 1i(X) .

Since X is -invariant, by fixing an element (a, b) in i(X) we have

i(X) = pr-X1(hX ) = {(a, b) + (x, y)  h[m, m + n, 0] | ordtxi    1  i  m} .

By definition, constructible motivic Functions on i(X) are equivalence classes of elements of C+(i(X)) modulo support of smaller dimension (cf. [3, Section 3.3], [4, Section 6]), hence
in IC+(i(X)) we have 1i(X) = 1X , where X is defined similarly as i(X) with ordtxi =  replacing ordtxi  . Now, applying Axiom A7 in [4, Theorem 10.1.1] inductively, we get

(prX)! 1i(X) = L-(+1)m 1hX .

The projection f of X onto the final object hSpeck in Defk can be factored through the canonical map  : X  hX , namely, we have the following commutative diagram

X







/ hX







 f '

f


hSpeck .

Therefore,

µ(X) = f!([1X]) = f L-(+1)m 1hX .

18

LE^ QUY THUONG

By [4, Proposition 5.3.1], we have
C+(h[0, m, 0]) = SK0(RDef h[0,m,0]) P0+(hSpeck) P+(hSpeck) = SK0(RDef h[0,m,0]) N[L-1] A+.

Thus, the element 1hX in C+(hX ) can be written as hX  hX  1. Then we have µ(X) = L-(+1)m hX  hX  hSpeck = L-(+1)m hX = loc(vol(X))
in SK0(RDefk) N[L-1] A+. Via the canonical morphism SK0(RDef k) N[L-1] A+  K0(Vark) Z[L] A = Mloc,
we may view the identity µ(X) = loc(vol(X)) holds in Mloc.

Let us recall some settings in Section 14.5 of [4] and Section 4.3 of [13] on the ramification.
Consider a formula  in the language LDP,P(k[t]), i.e., the coefficients of  are in k[t] in the valued field sort, in k in the residue field sort, such that  has m free variables in the valued
field sort, n free variables in residue field sort, and r free variables in the value group sort. For each e in N, let [e] denote the formula obtained from  by replacing everywhere t by te.
If X is a definable subassignment of h[m, n, r] defined by , we denote by X[e] the definable
subassignment of h[m, n, r] defined by [e]. Thus, if in addition X is bounded, then so is X[e], that is, [1X[e]] is in IC+(X[e]), for every e in N (cf. [4, Proposition 14.5.1]).

Proposition 5.5 ([4], Theorem 14.5.3). Assume X is a bounded definable subassignment of h[m, 0, 0] defined by a formula in LDP,P(k[t]) with m free variables in the valued field sort. Then the formal power series
ZX(T ) = µ(X[e])T e

is in Mloc[[T ]]sr.

eN

Let  be in N, and X a -invariant bounded definable subassignment of h[m, n, 0] defined by a formula in LDP,P(k[t]). Then, for every e in N, the bounded definable subassignment X[e] of h[m, n, 0] is e-invariant; therefore, there exists a constructible subset Xe of Le-1(Amk )×k Ank such that, for every K in Fieldk, X[e](K) is the pullback of Xe(K) under the canonical map

K((t))m × Kn  K[t]/(te) m × Kn.

Proposition 5.6. Let  be in N, and let X be a -invariant bounded definable subassignment of h[m, n, 0] defined by a formula  in LDP,P(k[t]) eliminating ac. Then the definable subassignment hXe is stable by the natural µe-action on h[m, n, 0] defined by
 · (x, ) = (x, ), with x(t) = x(t).

As a consequence, the class vol(X[e]) = hXe L-(+1)m
is an element in K0µ^(RDefk)[L-1] = Mµk^, and the identity

µ(X[e]) = loc(vol(X[e]))

holds in Mµloec, thus the series

Proof. By definition of -invariance, we have hXe = {(x, )  h[m, n, 0] | [e](x, ), 0  ordtxi  e - 1, 1  i  m} .
By Corollary 2.1.2 of [4], the LDP,P(k[t])-formula  is a finite disjunction of formulas of the form
(acg1(x), . . . , acgl(x), )  (ordtf1(x), . . . , ordtfl(x), ), where fi and gj are polynomials over k[t],  is an LRings-formula, and  is an LPR-formula. Since  is equivalent to an LDP,P(k[t])-formula without angular component symbol due to the hypothesis, [e] is a finite disjunction of formulas of the form
((gj (x))j, )  ((ordtfi(x))i, ),
with fi and gj being polynomials over k[te],  and  as previous. If in fi(x(t)) and gj(x(t)) we replace t by t, for any x(t) in K((t))m,  in µe(K), K in Fieldk, then we get expressions fi(x(t)) and gj(x(t)), since the coefficients of fi and gj in k[t][x] do not change. This proves that if (x, ) is in hXe, so is (x, ), for any  in µe, that is, hXe is stable under the action of µe.
Now assume that X is small. As mentioned above, there is a canonical action of µ^ on h[m, 0, 0] induced by
(, t)  t. We say that the definable subassignment X is µ^-stable if there exists an n  N such that, for every x = (x1(t), . . . , xm(t)) in X and  in µn, the point
 · x = (x1(t), . . . , xm(t))
is in X. Since formulas defining X is in the Denef-Pas language, by quantifier elimination for algebraically closed fields, they also define a semi-algebraic subset X of some arc space L(Amk ) of Amk . The assignment
XX carries the canonical µ^-action on h[m, 0, 0] to the canonical µ^-action on L(Amk ), and in that way, X is also µ^-stable in L(Amk ). As in [4, Theorem 16.3.1, Remark 16.3.2] we can see that X is measurable as X is measurable, and that since with the above action µ(X) is in Mµl^oc the measure µ(X) of X is also in K0µ^(RDefk) Z[L] A = Mµl^oc. Here, as in [4, Theorem 16.3.1], µ stands for Denef-Loeser's motivic measure [8], and further by [4, Remark 16.3.2], we can consider that this measure takes value in Mµl^oc for the context with µ^-action.
