## Abstract

Self-propelled droplets are composed of droplets driven by the waves they emit when bouncing on a vertically vibrated bath. Their dynamics is based on an interplay between the waves and their source. The existence of self-spinning modes is still controversial. Here, we show experimentally that these modes are stable for a class of droplets and emerge spontaneously from noise fluctuations. We perform a discrete stability analysis to confirm experimental observations. In addition, we show that these self-spinning modes provide a unique opportunity for a direct experimental measurement of parameters used in the wave-driven droplet models found in the literature to enable comparison and calibration.
