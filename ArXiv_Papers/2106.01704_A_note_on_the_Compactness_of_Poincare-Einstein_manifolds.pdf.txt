A NOTE ON THE COMPACTNESS OF POINCARE´-EINSTEIN MANIFOLDS

Abstract. For a conformally compact Poincar´e-Einstein manifold (X, g+), we consider two types

of compactifications for it. One is g¯ = 2g+, where  is a fixed smooth defining function; the

other is the adapted (including Fefferman-Graham) compactification g¯s = 2sg+ with a continuous

parameter

In

that

for

a

of

compact

Poincar´e-

Einstein manifolds {(X, g+(i))} with conformal infinity of positive Yamabe type, {g¯(i)} is compact

in Ck,(X) topology if and only if {g¯s(i)} is compact in some Cl, (X) topology, provided that

g¯(i)|T M = g¯s(i)|T M = g^(i) and g^(i) has positive scalar curvature for each i. See Theorem 1.1 and

Corollary 1.1 for the exact relation of (k, ) and (l, ).

1. Introduction Suppose Xn+1 is a (n + 1)-dimensional smooth compact manifold with boundary. Denote X the interior of X and M = X the boundary. Let  be a smooth boundary defining function, i.e.,
0    C(X),  > 0 in X,  = 0 on M , d|M = 0. We call (X, g+) a Ck, conformally compact Poincar´e-Einstein manifold with conformal infinity (M, [g^]), if g+ is a complete metric in X such that g¯ = 2g+ can be Ck, extended to X and satisfies

Ricg+ = -ng+ in X,

g¯|T M  [g^]

on M.

In this paper, we always require that n  3, k  3, 0 <  < 1 and  is fixed.

Given (M, [g^]), the existence and uniqueness of (X, g+), such that (X, g+) is Poincar´e-Einstein with conformal infinity (M, [g^]), are difficult problems in general. See [An1, An2, An3, GL, ST, LSQ]

and many other works for related results. The compactness problem was developed recently in a

series of papers by Chang-Ge-Qing. See [CGQ1, CGQ2].

The compactness problem is formulated as follows: Given a set of Ck, conformally compact Poincar´e-Einstein metrics {(X, g+(i))} with conformal infinity {(M, [g^(i)])}, if the boundary representatives {g^(i)} is compact in Ck,(M ) topology, whether {g¯(i) = ((i))2g+(i)} is also compact in Ck,(X) topology by a suitable choice of {(i)} such that g¯(i)|T M = g^(i). In [CGQ1, CGQ2], the authors proved that it is true under certain geometric assumptions for the case M = S3. In par-

ticular, they chose {g¯(i)} to be the Fefferman-Graham compactification of {g+(i)} when deriving the compactness, because for n = 3, this imposes an extra curvature vanishing condition for {g¯(i)}.

In this paper, we mainly want to show that once we get the compactness for one type of com-

pactification, then it may also hold for some other type. We consider a family of compactifications defined by a real parameter s for a given Ck, conformally compact Poincar´e-Einstein manifold

(X, g+) with conformal infinity (M, [g^]):

Then the adapted compactification of g+ is defined by

g¯s = 2sg+, where s = vsn-s .

(ii) For s = n, let w satisfy the following equation

-+w = n, w = log  + O() for some  > 0.

Then the Fefferman-Graham compactification of g+ is defined by

g¯F = 2F g+, where F = ew.

The spectrum condition required in (i) can be satisfied by a nonnegativity assumption on the

Yamabe constant of the conformal infinity. In [Le1], Lee showed that if the boundary Yamabe

In

case,

we

can

view

the

compactification as a limit of the adapted compactificaions:

forms

a

of

compactifications.

See

Section

4 for the details.

The adapted and Fefferman-Graham compactifications were first introduced in [CC] and [FG2]

respectively, which satisfy certain geometric curvature conditions and have certain advantage to

study the fractional GJMS operators on the boundary, as well as the correspondence of interior

Einstein metric with boundary conformal geometry. For example, while positive integer N , then the 2N -th order Q-curvature of g¯s vanishes, i.e.

The main theorem of this paper is the following.

Theorem 1.1. Suppose {(X, g+(i))} is a set of conformally compact Poincar´e-Einstein manifolds with conformal infinity {(M, [g^(i)])} satisfying Y(M, [g^(i)])  0. Let  be a fixed smooth defining

function and

g¯(i) = 2g+(i), g¯(i)|T M = g^(i).

For

let

{g¯s(i) }

be

the

adapted

(including

Fefferman-Graham)

compactification

of

g+(i)

with

the

fixed boundary representatives

g¯s(i)|T M = g¯(i)|T M = g^(i).

(a) If {g¯(i)} is compact in Ck,(X) (k  3, 0 <  < 1) topology, then {g¯s(i)} is compact in Cl,(X) (l  0, 0 <  < 1) topology, where

(a.1) l = k, 0 <  <  if k +  < 2s - n;

(a.2) l = k, 0 <  <  if k +   2s - n and 2s - n = 2N - 1 for some positive integer N ;

(a.3) l +  < 2s - n if k +   2s - n and 2s - n is not a positive odd integer.

,

and the boundary scalar curvature R^(i) > 0 for all i, then {g¯(i)} is compact in Ck,(X)

(0 <  < ) topology.

The proof of statement (a) is mainly based on the uniform H¨older norm estimates for the adapted (including Fefferman-Graham) boundary defining function s and the ratio s/, where  is the fixed boundary defining function (background coordinate). Here the main difficulty is that the equations which determine s and s/ are degenerate near the boundary and hence the classical Schauder estimates fail. We overcome this difficulty by combining asymptotic analysis and delicate extension theorem (Theorem 7.1) with improved Schauder estimates on weighted H¨older spaces (Definition 3.1) for uniformly degenerate operators given by Lee in [Le2]. These improved Schauder estimates are only valid for the weight in a certain indicial gap determined by the operators. Hence for k +   2s - n, it implies a loss of regularity in general. However, while 2s - n = 2N - 1 for some

A NOTE ON THE COMPACTNESS OF POINCARE´ -EINSTEIN MANIFOLDS

3

positive integer N , we can recover the full regularity by using the Q-curvature equation Qg2¯sN = 0. Otherwise, we can view this loss of regularity as the result of the fractional order term 2s-n in the

asymptotical expansion of s at boundary.

The proof of statement (b) is mainly by exploring the geometric positivities for g¯s under the assumption R^ > 0, which gives L estimates for s and |ds|g¯s directly. In this case, the equations that determine s are uniformly elliptic with background metric g¯s, and hence higher order norm estimates follow from the classical Schauder estimates. Moreover, R^ > 0 also implies that for  

(0, 1)

the

fractional

Q-curvature

is

positive

on

the

boundary

[GQ].

Hence

if

for

This

is

why

we

only

consider

s

or

s

.

Theorem 1.1 implies the following corollary directly.

Corollary 1.1. Suppose {(X, g+(i))} is a family of conformally compact Poincar´e-Einstein manifold with conformal infinity {(M, [g^(i)])} satisifying Y(M, [g^(i)])  0. Let  be a fixed smooth defining

function

and

2g+(i)|T M

=

g^(i) .

Assume that

g¯s(i)|T M = g¯t(i)|T M = g^(i)

satisfying R^(i) > 0 for all i. If {g¯s(i)} is compact in Ck,(X) (k  3, 0 <  < 1) topology, then {g¯t(i)} is also compact in Ck,(X) (0 <  < ) topology.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we review some basic properties for Poincar´e-
Einstein manifolds and its conformal compactification. In Section 3, we introduce the improved
Schauder estimates and invertibility theorem for + + s(n - s) given by Lee in [Le2]. In Section 4, we prove the global regularity theorem for g¯s. In Section 5, we investigate the geometric positivity results for g¯s under the assumption R^ > 0 for g^ = g¯s|T M . In Section 6, we prove Theorem 1.1. In Section 7, we provide an extension theorem, which is used in the proof of global regularity of g¯s.

Achknowlegement: The first author wants to thank Professor Sun-Yung Alice Chang for proposing the question about the compactness in different type of compactifications for Poincar´eEinstein manifolds.

2. Poincar´e-Einstein Manifold and Its Conformal Compactification

Suppose (Xn+1, g+) (n  3) is a Ck, conformally compact Poincar´e-Einstein manifold with conformal infinity (M, [g^]) with k  3, 0 <  < 1. Let  be a fixed smooth boundary defining
function. Denote g¯ = 2g+ and g¯|M = g^.
For any l  0 and 0   < 1, denote Cl,(X) and Cl,(X) the classical H¨older spaces consists of functions with local and uniform Cl, H¨older continuity.

2.1. Conformal Transformation. Let R¯, R¯ij be the scalar curvature and Ricci curvature tensor

of

g¯.

Let

J¯ =

1 2n

R¯

and

E¯ij

be

the

trace

free

part

of

R¯ij .

Let

H

be

the

boundary

mean

curvature

for (X, g¯). Notice that for k  3, a Ck, compactification of Poincar´e-Einstein manifold, (X, g¯)

always has an umbilical boundary. Hence the second fundamental form of the boundary is



=

1 n

H

g^.

Let + and ¯ be the Beltrami-Laplace operators for g+ and g¯ respectively. The conformal trans-

formation implies the following relation between the two operators:

(2.1)

+ = 2¯ - (n - 1) d, d· g¯;

4

and it also gives the scalar curvature and Ricci curvature of g¯ in terms of :

,

(2.3)

E¯ = -(n - 1)-1

1 (¯ )g¯

.

Notice that by assuming g¯  Ck,(X), we have |d|2  Ck,(X) and (2.2) implies that |d|2g¯ = 1 on M . This means the sectional curvature of g+ approaches to -1 at the boundary by [Ma]. We
also define the T-curvature of g¯ as follows:

(2.4)

T¯ = -1 1 - |d|2g¯ .

Then T¯  Ck,(X)  Ck-1,(X). By (2.2) again,

J¯

Therefore, J¯, E¯  Ck-1,(X)  Ck-2,(X).

2.2. GJMS Operators. We recall the GJMS operators for (X, g+) and (X, g¯) here. Since g+ and g¯ are (conformal) Einstein metrics, the GJMS operators of all orders are well defined for them. Let P2+N and P¯2N be the GJMS operators of order 2N w.r.t. g+ and g¯ respectively. Here we only consider the case 2  2N  k because of the finite regularity. Then

P2+N = Nj=1

If 2N = n + 1, then the formula is understood as a formal "limit" of n + 1  2N . See [GJMS, FG1, Go, CC] for more details. In particular, for N = 1,

Recursive formulae given in [Ju] show that for all N  1,

Q¯2N = (-)N-1J¯ + L.O.T.,

where L.O.T is a polynomial of derivatives of metric g¯ of order  2N - 2 with coefficients given by g¯ and g¯-1 in local coordinates.

3. Analysis on Poincar´e-Einstein manifold

In this section, we recall some analysis on a Ck, conformally compact Poincar´e-Einstein manifold (Xn+1, g+). Since our background metric g+ has only finite regularity, we will mainly follow from [Le2]. Let  be the fixed smooth boundary defining function and
g¯ = 2g+, g^ = g¯|T M .

Denote X = {0 <  < } for  > 0 small. Then X\X is a compact subset of X.

3.1. M¨obius Coordinates. First, we can cover M by finitely many smooth coordinate charts (, ), called the background coordinates, where  = (, ) = (, 1, · · · , n). After fixing a choice
of such background coordinates (, ), they form a finite covering of a neighbourhood W of M in
X. Then there is a positive number c > 0 such that Xc  W and every point p  Xc is contained in a background coordinate chart containing a set of the following form

{(, ) : | - p| < c, 0   < c}.
Let H be the half plane model of the hyperbolic space with coordinates (x, y) = (x, y1, · · · yn). Let gH be the hyperbolic metric gH = x-2(dx2 + dy2). Let Br be the geodesic ball in H with radius r and center (1, 0, · · · , 0). If p0  Xc/8, then choose the background chart containing p0 and define a Mo¨bius chart centered at p0 by
p0 : B2 - X, (, ) = p0(x, y) = (0 + 0x, 0y),
where (0, 0) is the background coordinates of p0. It is easy to check that for all 0 < r  2, Vr(p0) = p0(Br)  p0(B2)  Xc. We can also choose finite smooth coordinate charts i : B2 - X such that the sets i(B1) cover a neighborhood of X\Xc/8. For consistency, we will also call these "M¨obius Charts". Without loss of generality, we can require that  extends smoothly to a neighborhood of B2. We recall the following two properties for M¨obius charts given in [Le2].

Lemma 3.1. There exists a constant C > 0 such that if p0 : B2  X is any Mo¨bius chart, then

p0 g+ - gH Ck,(B2)  C,

sup
B2

|(p0g+)-1gH| + |(p0 g+)gH-1|

 C,

where · Ck,(B2) is the classical Euclidean H¨older norm.

Lemma 3.2. There exists a countable collection of points pi  X and corresponding Mo¨bius chart: i = pi : B2 - V2(pi) such that {V1(pi)} cover X and {V2(pi)} are uniformly locally finite.

In this paper, (X, ) are always fixed and hence the choice of background coordinates and M¨obius charts can also be fixed, while dealing with different metrics.

Remark 3.1. If {g+(i)} is a set of Ck, conformally compact Poincar´e-Einstein metric such that {g¯(i) = 2g+(i)} is compact in the Ck,(X) topology, then Lemma 3.1 holds for all i with a uniform constant C > 0.

3.2. Function Spaces. For l  0 and 0   < 1, recall that Cl,(X) and Cl,(X) are the classical H¨older spaces consisting of functions with local and uniform Cl, H¨older continuity respectively. Here we introduce two types of function spaces dealing with the asymptotical behavior of functions at the boundary.
For 0    l + , define a subspace C(l,)(X)  Cl,(X) by
C(l,)(X) = {u  Cl,(X) : u = O()}.
It is obviously that C(l0,)(X) = Cl,(X). The following Lemma is proved in [Le2, Lemma 3.1].

Lemma 3.3 (Lee). Let 0   < 1 and 0    l + .

6

FANG WANG AND HUIHUANG ZHOU

(1) C(l,)(X) = {u  Cl,(X) : j u|M = 0,  0  j < }. (2) C(l,)(X) is a closed subspace of Cl,(X). (3) If j is a positive integer and j - 1 <   j  l, then C(l,)(X) = C(lj,)(X). (4) If l <   l + , then C(l,)(X) = C(ll,+ )(X).

Definition 3.1. For   R, define the weighted H¨older space l,(X) as follows

l,(X) = {u  Cl,(X) : u l,(X) < };

the norm · l,(X) is given by

u l, (X) := -u l0, (X) and

u

l0, (X)

:=

sup


u Cl, (B2),

where the supremum is over all Mo¨bius charts.

Notice that l0,(X) Cl,(X). The main relation between C(l,)(X) and l,(X) can be seen from the following lemma, where the proof is given in [Le2, Lemma 3.7].

Lemma 3.4 (Lee). Let 0 <  < 1 and 0    l + . The following inclusions are continuous
(1) C(l,)(X)  l,(X). (2) ll+,(X)  Cl,(X).

Lemma 3.5. For 0  l +  < l +  and  < , the inclusion l,(X)  l,(X) is compact. 3.3. Schauder Estimates. In this paper, we mainly deal with the following elliptic operator:

(3.1)

P0 = + + s(n - s)

for

some

given

s

>

n 2

.

By

Lemma

4.8

of

[Le2],

we

have

the

following.

Lemma 3.6 (Schauder Estimates). Suppose   R, 0   < 1 and 2  l +   k + 1 + . If u  0,0(X) such that P0u  l-2,(X), then there exists a constant C > 0 such that

u l, (X)  C P0u + l-2, (X) u 0,0(X) . Proof. Let {i} be the uniform locally finite covering of X by M¨obius charts as in Lemma 3.2. Then the estimate we want reduces to the interior Schauder estimates for Li = i  P  (-i 1) in B2. By assumption, Li has uniform Ck-1,(B2) coefficients. Hence
u Cl, (B1)  C ( Liu + Cl-2, (B2) u C0,0(B2)). Here C only depends on the Cl-2,(B2) norm of the coefficients of Li.

Remark 3.2. If {g+(i)} is a set of Ck, conformally compact Poincar´e-Einstein metric such that {g¯(i) = 2g+(i)} is compact in the Ck,(X) topology, then Lemma 3.6 holds for all P0(i) with a constant C > 0 independent of i.

3.4. Fredholm and Invertibility. First by [Le2, Theorem C] (which was also proved in the smooth setting in [MM, Ma]), P0 defined in (3.1) has the following properties.

Lemma 3.7. For 0   < 1, 2  l +   k +  and n - s <  < s, the map

(3.2)

P0 : l,(X) - l-2,(X)

is Fredholm with kernel equal to the L2-kernel of P0. If further Spec(-+) > s(n - s), then (3.2)

is invertible.

Remark 3.3. If {g+(i)} is a set of Ck, conformally compact Poincar´e-Einstein metric such that {g¯(i) = 2g+(i)} is compact in the Ck,(X) topology and Y(M, [g^(i)])  0 for all i, then for 0   < 1, 2 < l +   k +  and n - s <  < s, the map

P0(i) : l,(X) - l-2,(X) is invertible for each i and there is a constant C > 0 independent of i such that

u l, (X)  C P0(i)u . l-2, (X)

Proof. By Lemma 3.6, 3.7 and Remark 3.2, we only need to show that if P0(i)u l-2,(X) = 1 then there is a uniform constant C such that u 0,0(X)  C. Otherwise, there exists a sequence {uk}k1 such that

P0(k)uk l-2, (X) = 1,

uk 0,0(X)  k.

Take vk =

uk

uk

.

0,0 (X )

Then

P0(k)vk

l-2, (X)



1 k

,

vk 0,0(X) = 1, =

vk l, (X)  C 

for some C > 0 independent of i. Take 2  l +  < l +  and n - s <  <  < s. Then by passing to a subsequence, we can assume

vk - v in l,(X) and g¯k - g¯() in Ck,(X). Hence P0(k)vk converges to P0()v in l-2,(X) and by assumption P0()v = 0. However, P0() : l,(X) - l-2, (X) is invertible. Hence v = 0, which contradicts with vk 0,0(X) = 1 for all k. We finish the proof.

For   R, we can also define

(3.3)

P = -(+ + s(n - s)).

Then a shifting of the weight shows the following.

Lemma 3.8. For 0   < 1, 2  l +   k + 1 +  and n - s -  <  < s - , the map

(3.4)

P : l,(X) - l-2,(X)

is Fredholm with kernel consisting of -f where f is in the L2-kernel of + + s(n - s). If further Spec(-+) > s(n - s), then (3.4) is invertible.

Remark 3.4. If {g+(i)} is a set of Ck, conformally compact Poincar´e-Einstein metric such that {g¯(i) = 2g+(i)} is compact in the Ck,(X) topology and Y(M, [g^(i)])  0 for all i, then for 0   < 1, 2 < l +   k +  and n - s -  <  < s - , the map

P(i) : l,(X) - l-2,(X) is invertible for each i and there is a constant C > 0 independent of i such that

u l, (X)  C P(i)u . l-2, (X)

3.5. Geodesic Normal Defining Function. While working with the boundary asymptotics, we usually choose the geodesic normal defining function. However, in our setting, it is no longer smooth. A general regularity version of [Le1, Lemma 5.1] gives the following.

Lemma 3.9 (Lee). There exists a boundary defining function x  Ck-1,(X) such that

(1) x =  + O(2);

(2) g~ = x2g+ has a Ck-1,(X) extension to M with g~|T M = g¯|T M = g^;

(3)

dx

in

neighbourhood

of

M.

Lemma 3.10. Let x and g~ be given in Lemma 3.9. Then

g~ = dx2 + g^ + x2g2 + O(x2+),

where

g2

=

-A^

and

A^ij

=

1 n-2

R^ij - J^g^ij

is the Schouten tensor of g^.

Proof. By a similar proof as [Le1, Lemma 5.2], we have

xR~ij + (n - 1)x~ij + (~ x)g~ij = 0,

~ x

=

-

1 2n

xR~

=

-xR~ij x~ix~j,

where ~ is the Laplace operator of g~, and x~i, x~ij denote the covariant derivatives w.r.t. g~, and R~, R~ij are the scalar and Ricci curvatures of g~. It is easy to see that x~ij|M = 0, which implies that (M, g^) is totally geodesic in (X, g~). Moreover,

R^

=

n

- n

1 R~|M



J^ = J~|M .

Hence by an identification of a collar neighborhood of M with [0, c) × M , we can write

g~ = dx2 + g^ + x2g2 + O(x2+).

Since g+ = x-2g~ satisfies Ricg+ = -ng+, the same calculation as in [CDLS] gives that g2 = -A^.

4. The Adapted and Fefferman-Graham compactifications

In this section, we study some basic properties for the adapted and Fefferman-Graham compactifications for a Poincar´e-Einstein manifold (X, g+), which were introduced in [CC] and [FG2] respectively. Suppose (Xn+1, g+) (n  3) is a Ck, conformally compact Poincar´e-Einstein manifold with k  3, 0 <  < 1. Let  be a fixed smooth boundary defining function. Denote
g¯ = 2g+ and g¯|T M = g^.

4.1. Definition of s and g¯s.

In

let

satisfy

the

following

equation:

(4.1)

- +vs - s(n - s)vs = 0, vs = n-s (1 + O()) for some  > 0.

Then the adapted compactification of g+ is defined by

Proof. First, with fixed , (4.1) has a solution. Notice that -+n-s - s(n - s)n-s = -n-s+1 (n - s)¯  + s(n - s)T .
where T is given in (2.4). Moreover, ¯ , T  Ck-1,(X). Hence

-n-s+1 (n - s)¯  + s(n - s)T  n-s+1Ck-1,(X)  nk--1s,+1(X).

If

s

>

n+1 2

,

then

n-s+1



(n - s, s).

By

Lemma

3.7,

there

exists

a

unique

vs



nk+-1s,+1 (X )

such

that

(-+ - s(n - s))(n-s + vs ) = 0.

If

n+1 2



s

>

n 2

,

then

n-s+1



s.

Take





(n - s, s).

Then

by

Lemma

3.7

again,

there

exists

a

unique vs  k+1,(X) such that

(-+ - s(n - s))(n-s + vs) = 0.

Second, vs > 0 in X. It is obvious that vs is positive near M . If vs has negative part in the interior, then by denoting  = {vs < 0}, we have   X and

-+vs - s(n - s)vs = 0, in ,

vs = 0,

on .

This contradicts to Spec(-+|)  Spec(-+) > s(n - s). So vs  0 and by strong maximum principle, vs > 0 in X.
Third, the positivity also implies the uniqueness with given . If there is a second solution v~s satisfies (4.1), then v~s > 0 in X and

+

vs v~s

+ 2 d log v~s, d

vs v~s

= 0,
g+

vs v~s

M

= 1.

By the strong maximum principle, this implies that vs  v~s in X. Finally, if there is another smooth defining function ~ such that ~2g+|T M = g^ then we have ~  ,
which does not change the definition of vs. Hence by above uniqueness, s is only determined by the boundary representative g^.

4.1.2. Case 2: s = n. In this case, the equation(4.1) is replaced by

(4.2)

- +w = n, w = log  + O() for some  > 0.

Then the Fefferman-Graham compactification of g+ is defined by g¯F = 2F g+, where F = ew.
Similarly the Fefferman-Graham defining function F  , which may only have finite regularity.

Lemma 4.2. The Fefferman-Graham defining function F is uniquely determined by g^.

Proof. First, (4.2) has a solution. Notice that

-+(log ) = n - [¯  + nT ],

where [¯  + nT ]  Ck-1,(X)  1k-1,(X).
By Lemma 3.7, there exists a unique w  1k+1,(X), such that
-+(log  + w) = n.

Since Spec(-+) > 0, then w > 0 and is uniquely determined by g^ by a similar proof of Lemma 4.1.

4.1.3. Continuous Family. In lots of discussions, we can view the Fefferman-Graham compactification as a special case of the adapted compactification in the following sense.

Lemma 4.3. If the Yamabe constant Y(M, [g^])  0, then the adapted defining function s is a

continuous

family

of

boundary

defining

functions

for

s

such

that

lim

s

Proof. For Y(M, [g^])  0, vs is a continuous family of solutions to (4.1). While s = n, vs = 1. Take a derivative in s at s = n and denote

dvs ds

= -w.
s=n

Then w satisfies (4.2). By L'Hospital rule,

lim

In the following of the paper, we will always assume

Y(M, [g^])  0.

So that for all s >

n 2

,

s

and g¯s

are well defined with given boundary representative g^.

We will

denote n = F for consistency.

4.2. Interior Regularity and Curvature Vanishing. Notice that g+ = -2g¯ has Ck, regularity

in the interior X. Therefore by the interior Schauder estimates for equations (4.1) and (4.2), for

all

s

>

n 2

s  Ck+1,(X), g¯s  Ck,(X).

This also can be seen from the proof of Lemma 4.1 and 4.2.

The adapted and Fefferman-Graham compactifications are introduced so that the compactified

metric g¯s possesses some certain geometric features. Let R¯s be the scalar curvature of g¯s, with

J¯s

=

1 2n

R¯s,

and

Q¯ 2g¯sN

its

2N -th

order

Q-curvautre.

Let

¯ s

be

the

Laplace-Beltrami

operator

for

g¯s.

Direct calculation shows that in X,

(4.3)

¯ ss = -sT¯s,

where

(4.4)

T¯s = -s 1 1 - |ds|2g¯s ,

and

(4.5)

J¯s

=

Therefore T¯s, J¯s  Ck,(X) and Q¯2g¯sN  Ck-2N+2,(X).

Then (4.2) implies that

However, to refer to

[CC] if interested.

4.3. Global Regularity of s and g¯s. It is obvious that the regularity of g¯s depends on both the initial regularity of g¯ and the parameter s. Even if g+ is C conformally compact and the geodesic normal defining function x is smooth in Lemma 3.9, we know that vs takes the form vs = xsF + xn-sG for some F, G  C(X) if 2s - n is fractional. And the regularity of s is stoped by this fractional order. Therefore it is nature to conjecture that the regularity of s and g¯s is given by the minimum of the background regularity of g¯ and the fractional order 2s - n. We give a strict
proof here.

4.3.1.

Case

s>

n 2

,

s

=

n.

In this case, denote

2
g¯s = 2sg+ = sn-s g¯,

s =

s 

n-s
.

Then vs = sn-s and (4.1) implies that

+vs + s(n - s)vs = n-sP (s),

where P = s-n(+ + s(n - s))n-s. Let us write P in background metric g¯: P s = 2¯ s - (2s - n - 1) d, ds g¯ + (n - s) ¯  + sT s,

where Therefore, s satisfies

T

=

1 - |d|2g¯ 



C k-1,(X ).

(4.6)

P s = 0, in X, s = 1, on M .

We begin by constructing an asymptotical solution for (4.6).

Lemma

4.5.

For

s

>

n 2

,

s

=

n,

there

exists

an

approximate

solution

~s



C k,(X )

such

that

P (~s) = F~, F~  k-1,(X).

where  = k +  if k +   2s - n or 2s - n / N;  = 2s - n if k +  > 2s - n and 2s - n  N. Moreover, there exists a constant C only depending on k,  and the Ck,(X) norm of g¯ such that

~s Ck,(X)  C,

F~ k-1,(X)  C ;

12

FANG WANG AND HUIHUANG ZHOU

and as   0, ~s has asymptotic expansion ~s = 1 + s,1 + · · · + ls,l,

where l = k if k +   2s - n or 2s - n / N; l = 2s - n - 1 if k +  > 2s - n and 2s - n  N. Here s,j  Ck-j,(M ) is determined by the derivatives of g¯ up to j-th order and

s,j Ck-j,(M )  C.

Proof.

Let s =

n 2

+

.

First g¯ is Ck,(X) and  

C(X), which together implies that the coefficients

in P are in Ck-1,(X). By Theorem 7.1, for any s,j  Ck-j,(M ), we can take ~s,j  Ck,(X) as

an extension of js,j such that ~s,j  js,j as   0. Moreover, there exists some constant C

only depending on k, j,  such that

~s,j Ck,(X)  C  s,j . Ck-j,(M )

Notice that under the background coordinates (, ), P is in the form

P =  aµ µ + bµµ + bµµ + c ,

where aµ, bµ  Ck,(X) and bµ, c  Ck-1,(X). By (3) in Theorem 7.1, -1P ~s,j  Ck-1,(X), and there exists some constant C only depending on the Ck,(X) norm of g¯, such that

-1P ~s,j Ck-1,(X)  C  s,j . Ck-j,(M )

As   0,

P (~s,j ) = -j(2 - j)j s,j() + O(j+),

where  = 1 if j < k and  =  if j = k. Now we are ready to construct the asymptotical solution ~s. Take ~s,0 = s,0 = 1. Then

P (1) = (n - s) ¯  + sT = F~0  F0,

where F~0  Ck-1,(X) and F0 = (n - s) ¯  + sT |M  Ck-1,(M ). Moreover, for some constant C1 only depending on the Ck,(X) norm of g¯,

-1F~0 Ck-1,(X)  C1,

F0 Ck-1,(M )  C1.

Choose s,1 = (2 - 1)-1F0. Let ~s,1  Ck,(X) be an extension of s,1 by Theorem 7.1. Then

P (1 + ~s,1) = F~1  2F1,

where F~1  Ck-1,(X) and F1  Ck-2,(M ). And similar as above for some constant C2 only depending on the Ck,(X) norm of g¯,

-1F~1 Ck-1,(X)  C2 ,

F1 Ck-2,(M )  C2.

Choose s,2 = [2(2 - 2)]-1F1. If k +   2 or 2 / N, we can repeat this progress until order k such that s,k  C0,(M ). Let
~s,k  Ck,(X) be an extension of ks,k by Theorem 7.1.

P (1 + ~s,1 + · · · + ~s,k) = F~k = O(k+),

where F~k  Ck-1,(X). And similar as above for some constant Ck only depending on the Ck,(X) norm of g¯,
-1F~k Ck-1,(X)  Ck.
Finally, we take ~s = 1 + ~s,1 + · · · + ~s,k and F~ = F~k. By Lemma 3.4, -1F~k  Ck-1,(X) and -1F~k = O(k-1+) imply that

-1F~  C(kk--11,+)(X )  kk--11+,(X) = F~  kk+-1,(X).

A NOTE ON THE COMPACTNESS OF POINCARE´ -EINSTEIN MANIFOLDS

13

By Lemma 3.3, 3.4, the inclusion C(kk--11,+)(X)  k-1,(X) is continuous and C(kk--11,+ ) is a closed subspace of Ck-1,(X). Hence there exists a constant C~ only depending on X such that

F~ = kk-+1,(X) -1F~ kk--11,+(X)  C~ -1F~ Ck-1,(X)  C~Ck. If k +  > 2 and 2  N, then we stop at the order 2 - 1. And

P (1 + ~s,1 + · · · + ~s,2-1) = F~2-1 = O(2 ),

where F~2-1  Ck-1,(X) and

-1F~2-1 Ck-1,(X)  C2-1.

Finally, we take ~s = 1 + ~s,1 + · · · + ~s,2-1 and F~ = F~2-1. Then

-1F~  C(k2-1-,1)(X )  2k--1,1(X) = F~  2k-1,(X).

Moreover, F~ = k2-1,(X)
We finish the proof.

-1F~ k2--1,1(X)  C~ -1F~ Ck-1,(X)  C~C2-1.

Remark 4.1. While k +  > 2s - n and 2s - n = 2  N, actually we can construct a full asymptotical solution such that P (~) = O(k+-) if we allow logrithmic terms in. However, here it does not help to discuss the global H¨older regularity, so we omit it.

P ~s = F~  kk+-1,(X).
By Lemma 3.8, P : kk++1,(X) - kk+-1,(X),
is invertible. Hence we can solve a unique ~s  kk++1,(X) such that P (~s + ~s) = 0.
Moreover, there exists a constant C only depending on the Ck,(X) norm of g¯ such that

~s  C kk++1,(X) F~ . kk-+1,(X)
By Lemma 3.4, kk++1,(X)  Ck,(X) is continuous. Hence for some constant C~ only depending on X, we have
~s Ck,(X)  C~C F~ . kk-+1,(X) Second, if k + 2  2, then

P ~s = F~  2k-1,(X)  lk+-1,(X),

for l  0, 0 <  < 1 such that l +  < 2. By Lemma 3.8 again

P : lk++1,(X) - lk+-1,(X),

is invertible. Hence we can solve a unique ~s  lk++1,(X) such that

P (~s + ~s) = 0.

Moreover, there exists a constant C only depending on the Ck,(X) norm of g¯ and C only depending on the maximum value of  such that

~s  C kl++1,(X) F~ kl+-1,(X)  C C  F~ . k2-1,(X)
By Lemma 3.4, lk++1,(X)  Cl,(X) is continuous. Hence for some constant C~ only depending on X, we have
~s Cl, (X)  C~C C  F~ . k2-1,(X) Combing above discussion with Lemma 4.5, we finish the proof.

By classical Schauder estimates, we have s  Ck,(X). Next, consider N  2. Notice that if k +  < 2N - 1, it is already proved in Lemma 4.6. So we
only need to consider the case k +   2N - 1. First choose l = 2N - 2. Then l +  < 2N - 1 and by Lemma 4.6, we have
s  Ck,(X)  Cl,(X).
Recall that by Lemma 4.4, in X,

(4.7)

Q2g¯sN = Ng¯s-1J¯s + L.O.T . = 0,

where L.O.T consists of derivatives of g¯s of order  2N - 2. Hence

L.O.T.  Ck-2N+2,(X)  C0,(X).

By Lemma 5.1, on the boundary J¯s|M  Ck-2,(M ). Hence by global Schauder estimate,

J¯s  Cl,(X).

Notice that by the definition of s and Lemma 4.6, c < s < C for some 0 < c < C only depending on the Ck,(X) norm of g¯. Now k - 2  l - 1, 0 < c < s < C, s, R¯s  Cl,(X), |ds|2g¯  Cl-1,(X) and R¯  Ck-2,(X). These imply that s  Cl+1,(X) by the global Schauder estimates. If k - 2  l, using |ds|2g¯  Cl,(X) again in equation (4.8), we have s  Cl+2,(X). Repeat this lifting progress and apply the global Schauder estimates to (4.7) and (4.8), until the regularity lifting is stoped by Ck,(X) assumption on g¯. Finally we get s  Ck,(X). And the
estimates of s Ck,(X) is directly from Lemma 4.6 and the global Schauder estimates for (4.7)
and (4.8).

Remark 4.2. If {g+(i)} is a set of Ck, conformally compact Poincar´e-Einstein metric such that {g¯(i) = 2g+(i)} is compact in the Ck,(X) topology and Y(M, [g^(i)])  0 for all i, then Lemma 4.5, 4.6, 4.7 hold with uniform estimates, i.e.

where C > 0 is independent of i. Here l +  = k +  if k +  < 2s - n or 2s - n = 2N - 1 for some positive integer N ; l +  < 2s - n if k +   2s - n and 2s - n is not an odd positive integer.

Lemma 4.8. There exists an approximate solution ~  Ck,(X) such that

where  = k +  if k +   n;  = n if k +  > n. Moreover, there exists a constant C only depending on k,  and the Ck,(X) norm of g¯ such that

and as   0,

where l = k if k +   n; l = n - 1 if k +  > n. Here j  Ck-j,(M ) is determined by the derivatives of g¯ up to j-th order and

j Ck-j,(M )  C.

Lemma 4.9. Let l +  = k +  if k +  < n and l +  < n if k +   n. Then   Cl,(X), and there exists some constant C > 0 only depending on the Ck,(X) norm of g¯ such that

where C > 0 is independent of i. Here l +  = k +  if k +  < n or n is odd; l +  < n if k +   n and n is even.

5. Geometric Positivity Results for g¯s.

In this section we investigate some more geometric features for the adapted and Fefferman-

6. Proof of Theorem 1.1

In this section, we prove Theorem 1.1. Suppose {(X, g+(i))} is a family of Ck, (k  3, 0 <  < 1) conformally compact Poincar´e-Einstein manifold with conformal infinity {(M, [g^(i)])} satisifying Y(M, [g^(i)])  0. Let  be a fixed smooth defining function and

g¯(i) = 2g+(i), g^(i) = g¯(i)|T M .

For

s

>

n 2

,

let

{g¯s(i) }

be

the

adapted

(including

Fefferman-Graham)

compactification

of

g+(i)

with

fixed boundary representatives:

g¯s(i)|T M = g¯(i)|T M = g^(i).

6.1. Proof of Theorem 1.1-(a). Assume {g¯(i)} is compact in Ck,(X) topology.

6.1.1.

Case

1:

s>

n 2

,

s

=

n.

In this case

g¯s(i) =

(si) 2 g+(i) =

2
(si) n-s g¯(i),

(si) =

(si) 

n-s
,

(si)|M = 1,

and (si) > 0 satisfies the equation (4.6) with background metric g¯(i). By the global estimates given in Lemma 4.6, 4.7 and Remark 4.2, there is a uniform constant C > 0 independent of i such that

(6.1)

(si) Cl,(X)  C,  i,

where

· l +  = k +  if k +  < 2s - n or 2s - n = 2N - 1 for some positive integer N ; · l +  < 2s - n if k +   2s - n and 2s - n is not a positive odd integer. Therefore, choosing 0 <  < , we have {(si)} is compact in Cl,(X). Moreover, there exist constants 0 < C1 < C2 independent of i, such that
C1 < (si) < C2,  i.

The uniform upper bound is obvious from (6.1). If there is no uniform lower bound, then by passing to a subsequence, we can assume

g¯(i) - g¯() in Ck,(X),

(si) - s() in Cl,(X),

where s()|M = 1, s()  0 and s()(p) = 0 for some p  X. However, s() satisfies the

equation (4.6) with background metric g¯(). Hence vs() = s()n-s satisfies the equation (4.1)

with background metric g+() = -2g¯().

Since Y (M, [g^()])  0 and Spec(-+()) >

n2 4

,

as

a

solution vs()(p) = 0 can not happen.

A NOTE ON THE COMPACTNESS OF POINCARE´ -EINSTEIN MANIFOLDS

19

Finally, the compactness of {(si)} in Cl,(X) and uniform boundness 0 < C1 < s(i) < C2 imply that {g¯s(i)} is compact in Cl,(X) topology.

6.1.2. Case 2: s = n. . In this case, g¯n(i) = (ni) 2 g+ = e2(i) g¯(i),

(i) = w(i) - log ,

(i)|M = 0,

and w(i) satisfies the equation (4.2), (i) satisfies the equation (4.9) with background metric g¯(i). By the global estimates given in Lemma 4.9, 4.10 and Remark 4.3, there is a uniform constant C > 0 independent of i such that

(6.2)

(i) Cl,(X)  C,  i,

where

· l +  = k +  if k +  < n or n is odd; · l +  < n if k +   n and n is even.
Therefore, choosing 0 <  < , we have {(si)} is compact in Cl,(X). And (6.2) implies that there is a uniform constant C1 > 0 such that

-C1 < (i) < C1,  i.

These imply that {g¯n(i)} is compact in Cl,(X) topology.

6.2.

Proof of Theorem 1.1-(b).

Assume {g¯s(i)} is compact in Ck,(X) topology for some s >

n 2

+1

or s =

n+1 2

and the boundary scalar curvature R^(i)

> 0 for all i.

We first derive some uniform

estimates for s.

6.2.1.

Case 1:

s>

In this case, first notice that (si)

satisfies the following equation for each

(6.4)

¯ ss = -sT¯s, in X,

s = 0,

on M .

And T¯s satisfies

(6.5)

¯ sT¯s + J¯sT¯s = -2|A¯s|2g¯s s + 2 ds, dJ¯s g¯s , in X,

T¯s = 0,

on M .

where A¯s is the Schouten tensor of g¯s.

Lemma

6.1.

For

if

{g¯s(i) }

is

and

for

all

then

there exist constants C > c > 0 such that for all i,

FANG WANG AND HUIHUANG ZHOU

(ii) (si) Ck+1,(X)  C; (iii) c < (si) < C; (iv) c < |d(si)|g¯s(i)  1 if  < c.

Proof. For (i), notice that R^(i) > 0 implies that J¯s(i) > 0 by Lemma 5.3. Therefore,

|d(si)|g¯s(i)  1 =

(si) L(X)  diam(X, g¯s(i)),  i.

For (ii), since {g¯s(i)} is Ck,(X) compact, there is a uniform constant C1 > 0 such that

A¯(si) Ck-2,(X)  C1,

J¯s(i) Ck-2,(X)  C1,  i.

By the classical Schauder estimates for equation (6.3), we first get

(si) Ck,(X)  C2,  i.

for some constant C2 > 0. Then (6.5) implies that T¯s(i) Ck-1,(X)  C3,  i.

for some constant C3 > 0. And hence (6.4) implies that

(si) Ck+1,(X)  C4,  i.

for some constant C4 > 0.
For (iii), since  is a fixed coordinates in a collar neighborhood Xc, the uniform upper bound of s(i)/ is directly from (ii). If there is no uniform lower bound, then by passing to a subsequence,
we can assume (si) - s(), in Ck,(X),

g¯s(i) - g¯s(), in Ck,(X).

and (s()/)|M = 1, (s()/)|p = 0 for some p  X. However, s() satisfies the equation (6.3) with background metric g¯s() and J¯s() > 0 in X. By the strong maximum principle, s() > 0 in X, which contradicts with s()(p) = 0. Hence there must be some constants 0 < c < C such that

c<

(si)

C,

 i.

For

(iv),

notice

that

|d(si) |2g¯s(i)

So

if

and

then

there exist constants C > c > 0 such that for all i,

(i) s(i) L(X)  C and T¯s(i) L(X)  C; (ii) s(i) Ck+1,(X)  C and T¯s(i) Ck-1,(X)  C;
(iii) c < s(i) < C; (iv) c < |ds(i)|g¯s(i)  1 if  < c.

Proof. For (i), first by Lemma 5.4, T¯s > 0 implies that

|d(si)|g¯s(i)  1 =

(si) L(X)  diam(X, g¯s(i)),  i.

If there is no uniform constant C such that T¯s(i) L(X)  C, then by passing to a subsequence, we can assume
T¯s(i) L(X) - +.

Take ~(i) = s(i)/ T¯s(i) L(X) and T~(i) = T¯s(i)/ T¯s(i) L(X). Then (~(i), T~(i)) satisfies

Notice that {g¯s(i)} is compact in Ck,(X) topology implies that

Hs(i) Ck-1,(M )  C1,

E¯s(i) Ck-2,(X)  C1,

for some constant C1 > 0 independent of i. Hence applying the classical Schauder estimate to above coupled system, we have

(~(i), T~(i)) Ck-1,(X)  C, for some constant C > 0 independent of i. By passing to a subsequence again, we assume

T~(i) - T~(), in C2(X),

g¯s(i) - g¯s(), in Ck,(X).

Then T~() satisfies

¯ s()T~() = 0, T~() = 0,

in X, on M .

This implies that T~()  0 which contradicts with T~() L(X) = 1. For (ii), it follows from (i) together with the classical Schauder estimates for the coupled equations
(6.6) and (6.7). For (iii), the uniform upper bound of (si)/ is directly from (ii). If there is no uniform lower
bound, then by passing to a subsequence, we can assume

(si) - s(), g¯s(i) - g¯s(),

in Ck,(X), in Ck,(X),

and (s()/)|M = 1, (s()/)|p = 0 for some p  X. Here s() and T¯s() satisfies the equation (6.6) and (6.7) with background metric g¯s(). And Hs()  0 on M implies that T¯s > 0 in X. By

22

FANG WANG AND HUIHUANG ZHOU

the strong maximum principle, s() > 0 in X, which contradicts with s()(p) = 0. Hence there must be some uniform constants 0 < c < C such that

c<

(si) 

<

C,

 i.

For (iv), notice that |d(si)|2g¯s(i) = 1 - (si)T¯s(i). Hence (iv) follows immediately from (iii).

Now

we

the

Theorem

there

Since s|M = 0, by Corollary 7.1 in the Appendix, there is a constant C > 0 such that

This together with Lemma 6.1-(iii) and Lemma 6.2-(iii) implies that for some constant C > 0,

Recall that

g¯(i) =

Therefore {g¯(i)} is compact in Ck,(X) topology for 0 <  < . We finish the proof.

7. Appendix
In this section we derive an extension theorem.
Lemma 7.1. For any k, l  0 and 0   < 1, suppose f = f (y) is a Ck, function which has compact support in Rny . Then there exists an extension F = F (x, y) satisfying the following properties:
(1) F  Ck+l,([0, 1)x × Rny ) and there exists some constant C1 > 0 only depending on (k, l, ) such that F Ck+l,([0,1)x×Rny )  C1 f ; Ck,(Rny )
(2) As x  0, F (x, y) has an asymptotical expansion
F (x, y) = xlf (y) + xl+1f1(y) + · · · xl+kfk(y) + O(xl+k+)
where fi(y)  Ck-i,(Ry) determined derivatives of f up to i-th order and there exists a constant C2 > 0 only depending on (k, l, ),
fi Ck-i,(Ry)  C2 f , Ck,(Rny )  0  i  k;
(3) For any j  0 and multi-index J  0, there exists a constant C3 > 0 only depending on (k, l, , j, J) such that

Then it is easy to check that fx  Cc(Rny ) and

lim

fx - f

Ck,(Rny ) = 0.

Hence there is some constant C0 > 0 such that

fx Ck,(Rny )  C0 + f , Ck,(Rny )  0 < x < 1.

Denote h(x, y) = fx(y). Then h satisfies the following properties: (i) If I is a multi index such that |I|  k, then

yI h(x, y) = x  yI f = (z)f (I)(y - xz)dz,

and since supp()  {|z| < 1},

These imply that for some constant C > 0 only depending on ,

yI h C0,((0,1)×Rny )  C f . Ck,(Rny )
(ii) If I is a multi index such that |I| > k, then choosing a multi index J with J  I and |J| = k, we have

Here cI are constants. For some constant C > 0 only depending on i, k and , we have

Now we define

F (x, y) = (x)xlh(x, y), 0 < x < 1.

And F (0, y) = f (y) if l = 0; F (0, y) = 0 if l > 0. By (i)-(iv), there exists some constant C > 0 only depending on k, l and  such that

F Ck+l,([0,1)x×Rny  C f . Ck,(Rny )
Hence F satisfies (1). For the asymptotical expansion of F , it is simply by taking x  0 in (iii). For i  k,

where cI are some constants. Replace (z) by ~(z) = |I|i cI (I+J)(z)zI and h by xj+J xj yJ h, then (i)-(iv) are also valid with an adjustment of the constants. Then (3) follows from a similar
proof of (1).

Theorem 7.1. Suppose X is a smooth compact manifold with boundary M . Let  be a smooth boundary defining function. For any integers k, l  0 and 0   < 1, if f  Ck,(M ), then there exists F  Ck+l,(X)   l (X) satisfies the following properties:
(1) There exists some constant C1 > 0 only depending on k, l, , such that

F Ck+l,(X)  C1 f Ck,(M );

(2) As   0, F has an asymptotical expansion as follows

F = lf0 + l+1f1 + · · · + l+kfk + O(xk+l+)
where fi  Ck-i,(M ) with f0 = f and there exists some constant C2 > 0 only depending on k, l, ,
fi Ck-i,(M)  C2 f Ck,(M),  i = 1, ..., k.
(3) If P is a differential operators of order m  k + l with coefficients in Ck,(X), then there exists some constant C3 > 0 only depending on the Ck,(X) norm of the coefficients such that

P F Ck+l-m,(X)  C3 f Ck,(M ),

mP F Ck+l,(X)  C3 f Ck,(M ).

Theorem 7.1 directly implies the following.

Corollary 7.1. Suppose X is a smooth compact manifold with boundary M . Let  be a smooth boundary defining function. For any integer k  0 and 0   < 1, if f  Ck+1,(X) satisfying
f |M = 0, then f /  Ck,(X). Moreover, there exists a constant C > 0 independent of f such that

f

f

Proof. First, f  Ck+1,(X) and f |M = 0 implies that f has Taylor expansion as the following: f = f1 + O(2),
where f1  Ck,(M ) and for some constant C1 > 0,

f1 Ck,(M )  C1 f . Ck+1,(X)

Take f~1 be the extension of f1 as in Theorem 7.1. Then for some constant C1 > 0, f~1 Ck+1,(X)  C1 f1 Ck,(M ).

Moreover, f - f~1 = 2f2 + O(3)
where f2  Ck-1,(M ) and for some constant C2 > 0,

f2 Ck-1,(M )  C2 f . Ck+1,(X)

E Ck+1,(X)  C f , Ck+1,(X) E = O(k+1+).

Therefore ,

E  C(kk++11,+)(X )  kk++11+,(X), =

E 



kk++1, (X )



C k,(X ).

By Lemma 3.3-3.4, C(kk++11,+)(X) is closed in Ck+1,(X) and above two inclusion maps are continuous. Hence for some constant C > 0,

E 

 C  E . Ck+1,(X)
C k, (X )

From the extension method given in Lemma 7.1 and Theorem 7.1, it is easy to see for some constant C > 0,

f~i 

 C  f~i , Ck+1,(X)

Ck,(X )

i = 1, 2, ..., k.

We finish the proof.
