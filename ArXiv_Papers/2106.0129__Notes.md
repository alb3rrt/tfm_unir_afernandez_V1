## Abstract

We deal with the stability problem for a stretched Euler-Bernoulli beam on a star graph with three edges. The beams are hinged with respect to the boundary vertices. The inner vertex is capable of both translation and rotation, the latter of which is subject to a combination of elastic and frictional effects. We present detailed results on the properties of the linear monic operator pencil associated with the spectral problem in Hilbert space. Within this framework it is shown that the eigenvectors have the property of forming an unconditional or Riesz basis, which makes it possible to directly deduce the exponential stability of the corresponding $C_0$-semigroup.
