## Abstract

Non-local point-to-point correlations between two photons have been used to produce "ghost" images without placing the camera towards the object. Here we theoretically demonstrated and analyzed the advantage of non-Gaussian quantum light in improving the image quality of ghost imaging system over traditional Gaussian light source. For any squeezing degree, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the ghost image can be enhanced by the non-Gaussian operations of photon addition and subtraction on the two-mode squeezed light source. We find striking evidence that using non-Gaussian coherent operations, the SNR can be promoted to a high level even within the extremely weak squeezing regime. The resulting insight provides new experimental recipes of quantum imaging using non-Gaussian light for illumination.
