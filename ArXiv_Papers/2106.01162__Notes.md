## Abstract

These notes stem from lectures given by the first author (JM) at the 2008 "Moonshine Conference in Kashiwa" and contain a number of new perspectives and observations on Monstrous Moonshine. Because many new points have not appeared anywhere in print, it is thought expedient to update, annotate and clarify them (as footnotes), an editorial task which the second author (YHH) is more than delighted to undertake. We hope the various puzzles and correspondences, delivered in a personal and casual manner, will serve as diversions intriguing to the community.
