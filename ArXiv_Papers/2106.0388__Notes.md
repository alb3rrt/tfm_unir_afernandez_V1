## Abstract

Privacy and confidentiality are very important prerequisites for applying process mining in order to comply with regulations and keep company secrets. This paper provides a foundation for future research on privacy-preserving and confidential process mining techniques. Main threats are identified and related to an motivation application scenario in a hospital context as well as to the current body of work on privacy and confidentiality in process mining. A newly developed conceptual model structures the discussion that existing techniques leave room for improvement. This results in a number of important research challenges that should be addressed by future process mining research.
