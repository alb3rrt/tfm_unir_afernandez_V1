## Abstract

We evaluate the results of the MSPK system using the objective measures of equal error rate (EER) and word error rate (WER), and also look into the distances between natural and synthesised t-SNE projections of the embeddings computed by an accurate speaker verification network. The results show that there is indeed a large correlation between the recording conditions and the speaker's synthetic voice quality. The speaker gender does not influence the output, and that extending the input text representation with syllable boundaries and lexical stress information does not equally enhance the generated audio across all speaker identities. The visualisation of the t-SNE projections of the natural and synthesised speaker embeddings show that the acoustic model shifts some of the speakers' neural representation, but not all of them. As a result, these speakers have lower performances of the output speech.
