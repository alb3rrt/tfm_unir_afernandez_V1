## Abstract

Motivated by \cite{CG10,CZ6}, we prove the global existence of solutions to the two-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with smooth initial data which are slowly varying in one direction and with initial density being away from vacuum. In particular, we present examples of initial data which generate unique global smooth solutions to 2D compressible Navier-Stokes equations with constant viscosity and with initial data which are neither small perturbation of some constant equilibrium state nor of small energy.
