Abstract
The discovery of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors has triggered enormous research interest recently. In this work, we use first-principles many-body perturbation theory to study a prototypical 2D ferromagnetic semiconductor, monolayer chromium tribromide (CrBr3). With broken time-reversal symmetry, spin-orbit coupling, and excitonic effects included through the full-spinor GW and GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) methods, we compute the frequency-dependent dielectric function tensor that governs the optical and magnetooptical properties. In addition, we provide a detailed theoretical formalism for simulating magnetic circular dichroism, magneto-optical Kerr effect, and Faraday effect, demonstrating the approach with monolayer CrBr3. Due to reduced dielectric screening in 2D and localized nature of the Cr d orbitals, we find strong self-energy effects on the quasiparticle band structure of monolayer CrBr3 that give a 3.8 eV indirect band gap. Also, excitonic effects dominate the low-energy optical and magneto-optical responses in monolayer CrBr3 where a large exciton binding energy of 2.3 eV is found for the lowest bright exciton state with excitation energy at 1.5 eV. We further find that the magneto-optical signals demonstrate strong dependence on the excitation frequency and substrate refractive index. Our theoretical framework for modelling optical and magneto-optical effects could serve as a powerful theoretical tool for future study of optoelectronic and spintronics devices consisting of van der Waals 2D magnets.

I. Introduction
Chromium trihalides CrX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) ­ magnetic semiconductors with layered structure in the bulk form [1-3] ­ have received enormous attention recently since the discovery of atomically thin 2D van der Waals magnets [4-10]. Atomically thin chromium trihalides exhibit high tunability with respect to electrostatic gating and magnetic fields [11-14], pressure [15, 16], and stacking order [17, 18], etc. Promising spintronics and valleytronics applications with van der Waals heterostructures consisting of atomically thin CrX3, such as the magnetic filtering effect [19, 20] and proximity effect [21, 22], have also been demonstrated in experiments.
Magneto-optical (MO) effects, including the magneto-optical Kerr effect, Faraday effect, and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), etc., are widely used as highly sensitive probes to characterize the electronic structure and magnetic properties of thin films [23, 24]. Among these, the magnetooptical Kerr effect has played important roles in the initial discovery of atomically thin intrinsic 2D magnets and demonstrated their rich magnetic behaviors [4, 5]. MO effects stem from the coupling between photons and the orbital motion of spin-polarized electrons, which is further interacting with the spin degree of freedom via spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Both the spin splitting and SOC effects are essential for MO effects [25, 26]. In addition, the optical and MO properties of 2D magnetic semiconductors are strongly modified by the electron-hole interaction, forming tightly bound excitons that enhance the optical and MO responses [27-29]. To accurately model the optical and MO properties of 2D magnetic semiconductors, one needs to calculate the quasiparticle excitation energies including self-energy effects, and then calculate both the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the dielectric function tensor including excitonic effects. These goals are achieved by using many-body perturbation theory such as the first-principles GW and GWBSE methods [30-33], which have proven very successful in explaining and predicting the optical or MO properties of a variety of 2D materials of recent interest, such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, black phosphorus, and CrI3 [28, 34-38]. With the support of spinor wavefunctions, it is possible to incorporate fully SOC effects going beyond a perturbative approach and achieve accurate dielectric function tensor with non-zero off-diagonal elements [28].

So far, there have been several theoretical efforts using the ab initio GW and GW-BSE methods to study excited-state physics in atomically thin CrX3, such as the exciton-dominated optical and MO properties in monolayer CrI3 [28], strong excitonic effects in the optical properties of monolayer, few-layer and bulk CrCl3 [39], as well as chemical trends in the electronic structure, optical, and magneto-optical responses in monolayer CrX3 [40]. However, there is still ambiguity regarding to whether self-energy effects on the quasiparticle bandstructure can be approximated through a rigid shift of the mean-field valence and conduction bands, as well as in how to calculate the MO signals from first principles including the important excitonic effects. In this work, we use ferromagnetic monolayer CrBr3 as a model system. As a member of the CrX3 family, monolayer CrBr3, which is an air-stable magnetic semiconductor with non-negligible SOC effects, provides an ideal platform for exploring fundamental physics and for potential applications of spintronics devices [41, 42]. However, a detailed and thorough theoretical study of self-energy and excitonic effects has been lacking. To this end, we perform full-spinor GW and GW-BSE calculations of ferromagnetic monolayer CrBr3 and demonstrate the importance of SOC, self-energy and excitonic effects. We further lay out the formalism to simulate the optical and MO properties with the calculated ab initio frequency-dependent dielectric function tensor.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we discuss the crystal structure of monolayer CrBr3 and the importance of SOC effects. Computational methods are explained in detail. In Sec. III, we discuss the treatment of broken time-reversal symmetry in the GW method and present the computed quasiparticle band structure results. In Sec. IV, we calculate the exciton eigenstates, and construct both the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the dielectric function tensor. We simulate the absorption spectrum with linearly polarized light, and analyze the exciton energy levels and exciton amplitudes in real space. In Sec. V, the formalism of MO effects from the ab initio calculated dielectric function tensor is presented. We then calculate the MCD of the absorption spectra. Finally, to connect to experiments, a two-interface polar setup with normal incidence is used to simulate the MO Kerr and Faraday effects in monolayer CrBr3 with different substrates.
II. Crystal structure and spin-orbit coupling effect
3

Bulk CrBr3, crystallized in the rhombohedral BiI3 structure type below 420 K, is a van der Waals layered materials, with the space group R 3" [2, 43]. Below the Curie temperature of ~ 37 K, longrange ferromagnetic order emerges with an out-of-plane easy axis [44, 45]. Within each atomic layer, Cr atoms are arranged in a honeycomb structure, with each surrounded by six bromine atoms arranged in an octahedron, as shown in Figs. 1(a) and (b). In its monolayer form, CrBr3 has a point group of S6, and a Curie temperature around 27~34 K [41, 42, 46]. The octahedral crystal field splits the Cr d orbitals into t2g and eg manifolds, of which the spin degeneracy is further broken by the magnetic exchange interaction, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Hybridization between Cr d orbitals and Br p orbitals broadens their band dispersion. Because Cr is in the 3d3 electronic configuration, each Cr site hosts a magnetic moment of 3 ! (with fully occupied major-spin t2g orbitals), according to the Hund's first rule. Recent in situ spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy experiments have confirmed the monolayer crystal structure and the out-of-plane easy axis [17]. Throughout this work, the magnetization of ferromagnetic monolayer CrBr3 is taken to be along the +z direction. The major-spin polarization direction is denoted as spin-up.
In this work, we used density-functional theory (DFT) and the method of local-spin-density approximation (LSDA) with an on-site Hubbard potential (LSDA+U) to serve as a reasonable mean-field starting point for the following GW (at the G0W0 level) and GW-BSE studies. The LSDA+U method employed is as implemented in the Quantum ESPRESSO package [47, 48]. We took the on-site Hubbard interaction parameter U = 1.5 eV and Hund's exchange interaction parameter J = 0.5 eV [49], the validity of which have been justified in previous theoretical works of chromium trihalides, sharing similar crystal structures and chemical environment [28, 39, 40]. A supercell model with a thickness of 16 Å along the direction normal to the layer was adopted to avoid interactions between periodic images. We employed optimized norm-conserving Vanderbilt pseudopotentials including Cr 3s and 3p semicore states [50]. The Kohn-Sham orbitals were constructed with a plane-wave energy cutoff of 70 Ry. We used the experimental monolayer lattice constant  = 6.3 Å [17], and relaxed the internal coordinates until the forces are converged within 5 meV/Å. The relaxed structure has a Cr-Br-Cr bond angle of 94.84°, consistent with the ferromagnetic super-exchange interaction [51]. In both DFT and GW calculations, we truncated the Coulomb interaction in the z direction as discussed in Refs. [52-54].

In the materials family of CrX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), the SOC strength and magnetic anisotropy increase with the atomic mass of the halogen element [2, 42, 55]. On the one hand, previous first-principles studies on excitonic effects in monolayer and few-layer CrCl3 have neglected SOC effects [39], which is justified by its small magnetic anisotropy [56]. On the other hand, monolayer CrI3 hosts strong SOC strength and forms a highly anisotropic Ising-type spin system with an out-of-plane easy axis, which means a first-principles modelling of its optical and MO properties must include SOC effects [28, 40]. It is therefore interesting to first study SOC effects on the Kohn-Sham (meanfield) DFT bandstructure of monolayer CrBr3, which shows reduced anisotropy compared with CrI3 in the bulk and few-layer forms [42, 57]. In Figs. 1(d) and (e), we compare the band structure of monolayer CrBr3 without and with SOC effects, respectively. Monolayer CrBr3 has an indirect bandgap of 1.67 eV both without and with SOC, the valence band maximum is at the M point while the conduction band minimum is along the G-K path. The direct bandgap at the M point is 1.69 eV without SOC and 1.68 eV with SOC. Without SOC effects, spin is a good quantum number, and the bandstructure in Fig. 1(d) can be grouped into spin-up and spin-down bands. The energy ordering of Cr d states, as shown in the projected density of states (DOS) plots in Figs. 1(d) and (e), agrees well with our above analysis of the Cr d-orbits in an octahedral crystal field. When we switch on SOC effects, there are noticeable changes to the band structure, as shown in Fig. 1(e). First, two-fold degeneracies at G are lifted, because the double group "# (to which the Bloch states at the G point belongs in the presence of SOC) has only one-dimensional irreducible representations. Second, spin is no longer a good quantum number and some lower-energy valence states have mixed spin polarization. Third, according to the projected DOS plot in Fig. 1(e), spindown Cr d orbitals have more contribution to the top valence states when SOC effects are present. In this way, we conclude that SOC effects are important in describing the electronic structure of monolayer CrBr3, and therefore using full-spinor wavefunctions in the GW and GW-BSE formalism are essential [28, 38].
III. Quasiparticle bandstructure
In this section, we describe the computational details of our GW calculations at the G0W0 level and compute the quasiparticle bandstructure of monolayer CrBr3. An accurate first-principles modeling of the electronic structure of monolayer CrBr3 needs to account for the magnetic order,
5

the dielectric screening in a quasi-2D environment, as well as the on-site Coulomb interaction

among the localized spin-polarized electrons. Through the screened Coulomb interaction W, the

nonlocal and dynamical screening effects beyond DFT-LSDA can be captured accurately. In the

presence of long-range magnetic order, there is no time-reversal symmetry in the system. We

therefore use the full Adler-Wiser expression to calculate the static irreducible polarizability within

the random-phase approximation (RPA) used in the Hybertsen-Louie plasmon-pole model [30,

58],

where & is the number of k-points, V is the volume of a unit cell, /1(2±) and 3172 are the mean-

field band energies of the valence and conduction Kohn-Sham orbitals, respectively. Note that here

the two terms in the summation cannot be combined into one using time-reversal symmetry. The

full Adler-Wiser expression is crucial to keep the particle exchange symmetry of the screened

Coulomb interaction such that (12) = (21). Since we choose LSDA+U as our mean-field

starting point for the subsequent G0W0 calculations, we treat on the same footing the Hubbard potential (89:) and the LSDA exchange-correlation potential ;=<>#?. That is, we subtract these mean-field contributions to the exchange-correlation potential in the G0W0 self-energy and use the

difference as a first-order perturbation on the mean-field band energies [30]. The self-energy

correction operator is given by [59-61],

 =  - ;=<>#? - 89:,

(2)

where  is the self-energy operator in the GW approximation [30].

The GW (at the G0W0 level) and GW-BSE calculations --- for the quasiparticle bandstructure and optical properties, respectively --- were performed using the BerkeleyGW package [53]. Since the standard sum-over-bands approach [30] and the static remainder approach [62] in calculating the GW self-energy converge to the final result in opposite directions, we took their average to speed up the convergence of quasiparticle band energies with respect to the number of empty states. The kinetic energy cutoff in calculating the screened Coulomb interaction was set to 50 Ry, and a total
6

of 2,000 bands were included in the GW calculation. As for k-space sampling, we adopted a 5×5×1 k- and q-grid with 3 subsampling points [63]. The quasiparticle bandgap was converged to within 50 meV. In order to perform Wannierization of the Cr 3d orbitals and Br 4p orbitals (a total of 56 orbitals) for later interpolation of the quasiparticle bandstructure, the self-energy corrections of 42 valence bands and 14 conduction bands were calculated on a 15×15×1 grid. We treated the dynamical screening effect through the Hybertsen-Louie plasmon-pole model [30], where the charge density of the itinerant valence states (42 in total, excluding semicore Cr 3s and 3p states) were used. The resulting quasiparticle band structure was interpolated with spinor Wannier functions, using the Wannier90 package [64].

In Fig. 2, we show the quasiparticle bandstructure of monolayer CrBr3 at the G0W0 level. The indirect quasiparticle bandgap is 3.80 eV and the direct bandgap at the M point is 3.81 eV. Our calculations reveal a strong self-energy correction of 2.11 eV to the indirect quasiparticle bandgap, due to the weak dielectric screening in reduced dimensions and the localized nature of the Cr d states. This self-energy correction is larger than that in monolayer CrI3 (correction is 1.77 eV) [28] because the states are more localized with smaller bandwidth in monolayer CrBr3 and the dielectric screening is weaker. Moreover, according to the projected density of state (DOS) plot in Fig. 2, we find that self-energy effects push the valence states that are dominated by Br p orbitals further down in energy. Also, self-energy effects on the major-spin t2g and eg bands cannot be approximated by a rigid shift, because these states have strong p-d hybridization. The calculated quasiparticle band energies will be used in the next section as input to the BSE calculations.

III. Excitonic effects and optical properties

To solve for exciton eigenstates (correlated electron-hole pairs), we solve the BSE of the interacting two-particle Green's function [31] in the form of an eigenvalue problem,

3@/(3 - /) + 0 3@#/## D, :F:AA, AG = 3@/@,

(3)

3#/##

where 3 and / are quasiparticle energies of an electron in the conduction band and negative of the quasiparticle energy of a hole in the valence band. The exciton eigenstate with excitation

energy @ is given by | = 3/ 3@/|, , as a coherent superposition of free electron-hole

7

pairs at different k-points. F = FB + F; is the electron-hole interaction kernel, containing an attractive direct screened Coulomb term and a repulsive exchange bare Coulomb term [31]. When evaluating FB , we again used Eq. (1) for the polarizability in order to keep the BSE matrix Hermitian. We performed the BSE calculation of monolayer CrBr3 within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation [31] and considered interband transitions between 21 valence bands and 14 conduction bands on a 15×15×1 Monkhorst-Pack k-grid in order to converge the calculation of the dielectric function tensor up to the frequency of 5 eV. An energy cutoff of 20 Ry was used for calculating the BSE kernel.

As an extensive physical quantity, the dielectric function is ill-defined for 2D materials. In this

work, we rescaled the dielectric function which was calculated with a supercell approach by the

8

thickness  of the 2D material (e.g.,  = :9H7/3 = 6.07  for monolayer CrBr3 based on the bulk crystal structure [65, 66]),

(9)

where  is the thickness of the supercell along the out-of-plane direction. Despite the ambiguity in defining  for 2D materials, measurable quantities such as absorption spectrum, MO signals, etc. are independent of the rescaling procedure [28]. Since we only consider normal incidence in the following discussion, the in-plane (xx and xy) components of () of monolayer CrBr3 are calculated and shown in Figs. 3(a) and (b). We find that the excitonic effects greatly reshape the dielectric responses by comparing the dielectric functions in Fig. 3(a) (without electron-hole interaction, GW-RPA) and those in Fig. 3(b) (with electron-hole interaction, GW-BSE). We calculate the optical absorption spectrum of linearly polarized light in Fig. 3(c) using the diagonal elements of the GW-RPA and GW-BSE dielectric functions. The GW-BSE absorption spectrum features several absorption peaks below the quasiparticle bandgap at around 1.5 eV, 2.1 eV, 2.6 eV, etc. and another strong peak with ~10% absorbance at around 4.0 eV. Several bright exciton states are responsible for these peaks in the absorption spectrum, as seen in the plot of exciton energy levels in Fig. 4(a), where the bright exciton states are colored in red and dark states in gray. Unlike monolayer CrI3, the top valence bands are flat in monolayer CrBr3, creating a large joint DOS across the bandgap which strongly enhances the excitonic effects and thus increases the exciton binding energies. The first bright exciton has an excitation energy of 1.5 eV, which leads to a huge binding energy of 2.3 eV. In the following, we visualize the exciton amplitudes in real space in Figs. 4(b-e). Note that the valence and conduction Bloch waves here are all twocomponent spinor wavefunctions, which means the electron-hole distribution for a selected exciton state should be calculated as,

(I, J) = 0 :>3//(JJ)3(II):G,

(10)

L$L%

where J and I refers to the z-axis spinor components of the hole (/) and electron (3) states,

respectively. Unlike monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides where the lowest-energy bright

9

excitons are of Wannier type with a diameter of several nanometers [34, 35], ferromagnetic monolayer CrBr3 hosts bright charge-transfer exciton states that extends over one to several primitive cells, indicating formation from band transitions instead of intra-atomic d-d transitions. These plots of exciton distribution are also consistent with the intuition that a larger exciton binding energy is related to a smaller exciton radius [67].
IV. Magneto-optical effects
In magneto-optics, a linearly polarized plane-wave light propagating through a medium is modified by the presence of a magnetic field, where the + and ' circularly polarized components propagate with different refractive index and therefore pick up different optical excursion and absorption. There are several important MO effects, such as the Faraday effect [68], the magneto-optical Kerr effect [69], and MCD. In the Kerr effect, the polarization change of the reflected light is measured, while in the Faraday effect, the polarization change of the transmitted light is measured. The polarization of a linearly polarized plane-wave light reflected from a magnetic material is modified. That is, the reflected light become elliptically polarized (characterized by an ellipticity angle) and the long axis of the polarization ellipse of the reflected light is rotated (characterized by a rotation angle). In this work, we consider the most common MO setup used to study 2D magnets [5, 9]: the polar setup with normal incidence, where the direction of magnetization is parallel to the out-of-plane direction (+z). MCD, on the other hand, describes differential absorption of circularly polarized lights.
In order to have non-zero MO effects, we need the magnetic exchange interaction to break spin degeneracy such that interband transitions involving different spin-polarized states happen at different energies, as well as SOC effects to break orbital degeneracy such that same-spin transitions corresponding to different circularly polarized lights are no longer equivalent [25, 26, 70].
When the magnetic material has C3 rotational symmetry along the spin polarization direction (zaxis), its frequency-dependent dielectric function tensor as a function of the magnetic field takes the following form,

(12)

defined after the cartesian coordinate system is set up. Moreover, according to the Onsager

reciprocal relations [71], we have,

CD(, ) = DC(, -).

(13)

Eq. (13) allows us to easily calculate the MO effects when the magnetization direction is flipped.

Using Eq. (12), we calculate the absorption spectrum of circularly polarized lights in monolayer CrBr3 in Fig. 5(a) without electron-hole interaction, and in Fig. 5(b) with electron-hole interaction. Note that the ranges of frequency and absorbance are different in these two plots. Compare Figs. 5(a) and (b), we find that the electron-hole interaction enhances absorption for both circularly polarized lights in the frequency range of interest. In addition, by calculating the MCD signal as (+ - ')/(+ + ') in FIG. 5(c), where ± denotes the absorbance for ± circularly polarized lights, we find that the excitonic effects significantly enhance the dichroism over a large frequency range up to the onset of the electron-hole continuum. This is because the BSE matrix, which involves the dielectric function and carrier wavefunctions in the presence of a magnetic order, has no time-reversal symmetry. Therefore, the excitonic effects are different on different circularly polarized transitions. The peak position and helicity of the first bright exciton peak in Fig. 5(b) agree well with recent polarization-resolved magneto-photoluminescence measurements, where the photoluminescence peak is located at 1.35 eV [41].

11

In the following, we discuss how to calculate MO Kerr and Faraday signals in a two-interface polar

setup, as shown in Fig. 6(a). The system consists of two interfaces located at E and R, with the middle (1st) layer being the atomically thin magnetic material of interest. The left (0th) and right (2nd) layers are semi-infinitely thick. A normal incident light comes from the right side, and we

measure the reflected light on the right side or the transmitted light on the left side. In the following,

we adopt the 4´4 formalism used in studying birefringent multilayer media and magneto-optical

ellipsometry [72, 73], which can be generalized to more complex setups. We consider a

ferromagnetic monolayer CrBr3 magnetized along the +z direction, and the 2nd layer is vacuum.

Within each layer ( = 0,1,2), we choose the four eigenmodes of light as follows, y(S)R = y(S)G =

y+, y(S)T = y(S)U = y' , with the corresponding refractive indices, R(S) = -G(S) = +, T(S) =

-U(S) = '. The electric and magnetic fields of light in the 1st and 2nd layers are given by,

The propagation matrix is defined as a diagonal matrix with entries being optical excursion for

middle layer. In this two-interface setup, E(E) and E(G) are related by the following expression,

E(G) = E(E) = Z·(G)·'R(R)(R)·(R)·'R(E) ` E(E).

where _\ and _\ are the one-interface Fresnel coefficients from the m-th layer to the n-th layer.

However, in the measurement of MO signals, we use a linearly polarized light and measure the

polarization of the reflected or transmitted elliptically polarized light. Assuming the left and right

layers are non-magnetic and isotropic with one optic axis of their dielectric tensor pointing along

the z direction, we adopt a basis transformation from the circularly polarized light to linearly

polarized light in the left and right layers: yR(S) = y(GS) = yM, y(TS) = y(US) = yN , as well as R(S) = -G(S) = T(S) = -U(S) = (S), for  = 0, 2. In the following, this new basis of linearly polarized plane waves is denoted as { ,  ,  ,  }, emphasizing the polarization and propagation

direction of each mode. In this basis of linearly polarized lights, the electric field amplitudes in the

left and right layer are related by,

As mentioned above, we consider an incoming x-polarized light from the 2nd medium to the 0th

medium, which means, E(EM) = E(EN) = 0 . With these conditions, we can calculate the

Next, we apply Eqs. (22)-(29) to study the MO Kerr and Faraday signals of monolayer CrBr3 with

different substrate materials. First, we consider the simplest case with both left and right layers

being just vacuum and calculate the Faraday angle 2 (solid blue) and ellipticity 2 (dashed red) in Fig. 6(d). We find that 2 and 2 are connected through a set of approximate Kramers-Kronig relations, as expected from previous works [24]. As shown in Fig. 6(d)-(f), we find a strong

dependence of the MO signals on the excitation frequency. In particular, we predict a maximal

positive 2 of 2 mrad around the excitation frequency of 2.6 eV and negative 2 of the order of -1 mrad between 2.0 and 2.5 eV. Furthermore, we calculate the Kerr signals in the presence of

conventional thick substrate materials, namely, sapphire and fused silica. Both insulating

substrates have large bandgaps and little absorption in the range of 1.0~3.5 eV. We model their

refractive indices using experimental values at the relevant frequencies with n = 1.5 for fused silica

[75] and n = 1.75 for sapphire [76]. In Figs. 6(e) and (f), we show the calculated Kerr signals in

the setup with sapphire and fused silica substrates, respectively. We find a similar shape for the

signals but with opposite sign compared with the Faraday signals in Fig. 6(d). In addition, different

substrate materials can strongly modify the amplitudes of Kerr signals. For example, the signals

in the fused silica setup are almost twice as large those in the sapphire setup. Close attention

therefore should be paid in interpreting MO experiments on atomically thin 2D magnetic

semiconductors with different substrate configurations.

V. Summary

In conclusion, we present a detailed theoretical formalism to model the optical and MO properties of 2D magnetic semiconductors, including the important SOC and excitonic effects. Using the first-principles full-spinor GW and GW-BSE methods without time-reversal symmetry, we calculate the exciton eigenstates and frequency-dependent dielectric function tensor of a prototypical 2D magnetic semiconductor, ferromagnetic monolayer CrBr3. The calculated optical absorption spectrum and MO signals demonstrate dominant excitonic effects. With a two-interface model, we also find that the substrate refractive index will significantly affect the MO signals. Our

work provides a theoretical framework and a first-principles approach to simulate the optical and MO properties of 2D magnetic semiconductors, and sheds new light on possible design principles for building new optoelectronic and spintronic devices with magnetic van der Waals materials.

FIG 5. (a) Absorption spectrum of circularly polarized lights without electron-hole interaction (GW-RPA). (b) Absorption spectrum of circularly polarized lights with electron-hole interaction (GW-BSE). The solid red (dashed blue) curve corresponds to the + (') circularly polarized light. The amplitudes below 1.8 eV (black dashed line) are multiplied by 10 for better visibility in (b). (c) Frequency-dependent MCD signal of absorbance with (red, GW-BSE) and without (blue, GWRPA) electron-hole interaction. The MCD signal is calculated as (+ - ')/(+ + '), where ± denotes the absorbance for ± circularly polarized lights in (a) and (b). Due to vanishing absorbance for both circularly polarized lights at low frequencies, MCD signals are set to zero below 1.3 eV for GW-BSE and below 3.7 eV for GW-RPA as shown by the dashed horizontal lines.

FIG 6. (a) Polar setup of the MO effects with two interfaces (located at E and R). Each layer is homogeneous in the x-y plane. The left (0th) and right (2nd) medium is semi-infinitely thick, and the middle (1st) layer has a finite thickness  = R - E. The normal incident light coming from right to left is linearly polarized along the x-axis. The red arrow pointing along the +z direction denotes the magnetization of layer 1. (E) and (R) denote the amplitudes of electric fields in the 0th and 1st layer at the E interface, respectively. (G) denotes the amplitude of electric field in the 2nd layer at the R interface. (b) The polarization plane of the transmitted light. (E) denotes the electric field amplitude of the transmitted (left-moving) light. The polarization ellipse is oriented at a Faraday angle 2 with respect to the x-axis. The Faraday ellipticity is defined through the Faraday ellipticity angle 2. (b) The polarization plane of the reflected light. (G) denotes the electric field amplitude of the reflected (right-moving) light. The polarization ellipse is oriented at a Kerr angle d with respect to the x-axis. The Kerr ellipticity is defined through the ellipticity angle d. (d) Calculated Faraday angle and ellipticity in the setup with layers of semi-infinite vacuum, monolayer CrBr3, and semi-infinite vacuum. (e) Kerr angle and ellipticity in the setup with layers (from left to right) of semi-infinite sapphire, monolayer CrBr3, and semi-infinite vacuum. (f) Kerr angle and ellipticity in the setup with layers (from left to right) of semi-infinite fused silica, monolayer CrBr3, and semi-infinite vacuum. A monolayer thickness d=6.07Å is used for monolayer CrBr3.
