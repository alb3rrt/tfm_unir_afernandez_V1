EXPONENTIAL MIXING, KAM AND SMOOTH LOCAL RIGIDITY
RALF SPATZIER  AND LEI YANG 
Abstract. Consider actions of Zr by ergodic automorphisms on a compact nilmanifolds for r  2. We show that small Ck perturbations of such higher rank partially hyperbolic actions are smoothly conjugate to the original action, using a KAM scheme. The driving force for convergence of this iteration is the exponential mixing of the original action.

1. Introduction
Smooth rigidity of actions by commuting diffeomorphisms and flows has attracted significant attention over the last three decades. There are many such actions coming from homogeneous dynamics, and in particular automorphisms of tori and nilmanifolds, or possibly an action by commuting translations on a homogeneous space G/ for G a Lie group,  a lattice in G. These are called algebraic or also homogeneous models. The goal is to completely classify such actions up to smooth conjugacy or at least prove local smooth rigidity for the algebraic models.
The case when G is noncompact semisimple is possibly best understood, thanks to the abundance of tools from hyperbolic dynamics, representation theory, an abundance of relations between various one-parameter subgroups and the many rigidity properties of such groups G. We refer to the works by Damjanovic, Hurder, Kalinin, Katok, Lewis, Spatzier, Vinhage and Wang (cf. e.g. [Hur94, KS97, DK05, DK11, VW19]). They were at first largely motivated by applications to the Zimmer program of studying actions of higher rank semisimple Lie groups and their lattices on compact manifolds, cf. e.g. [Hur94, KL96, KL91, KLZ96, KS97, GS99] amongst others.

In this paper, we will concentrate on higher rank actions of Zk by automorphisms on nilmanifolds, the last major open case for local rigidity. Let us first though recall some prior work. Both local and global rigidity has been achieved for actions on compact nilmanifolds G/ where G is a simply connected nilpotent Lie group G and  a discrete cocompact subgroup of G with the following proviso. If the action is generated by a single Anosov diffeomorphism f , one can easily perturb f to another Anosov diffeomorphism by a local perturbation at a periodic point which changes the derivative at that point. One can then argue that the perturbed Anosov diffeomorphism cannot be smoothly (not even C1) conjugate to an algebraic model. A similar remark applies to products of Anosov diffeomorphisms on product manifolds. One coins the notion of rank 1 factor of an arbitrary Zk action, i.e. a smooth factor of the action on which some Zr-1  Zr acts trivially. We further recall that any Anosov diffeomorphism on a compact nilmanifold is C0-conjugate to an algebraic model by a classical result of Franks and Manning [Fra69, Man73]. This conjugacy will automatically extend to the commuting diffeomorphisms as well. We call the resulting algebraic model the linearization of the original action.
The ultimate global rigidity result for Zr Anosov actions on nilmanifolds was obtained by Federico Rodriguez Hertz and Zhiren Wang in [RHW14]. More precisely, they assume that the action has at least one Anosov diffeomorphism and that the linearization has no rank 1 factors. This extended earlier work by Fisher, Kalinin and the first author who had to assume existence of many Anosov diffeomorphisms [FKS13].
Note that the global rigidity results for higher rank Anosov actions strongly depend on the existence of the Franks-Manning Hölder conjugacy which requires the presence of an Anosov diffeomorphism. In consequence, global rigidity results for higher rank actions of commuting partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms on nilmanifolds are currently out of reach. Instead, we investigate local rigidity results for the algebraic models. The following theorem settles the nilmanifold case. It generalizes work by D. Damjanovic and A. Katok for higher rank actions of commuting ergodic toral automorphisms [DK10a] assuming the action does not have a rank 1 factor via an action by nil-automorphisms on a compact nilmanifold G/. To be precise, we require that the action 0 by nil-automorphisms of Zr on G/ does not have a factor action by nil-automorphisms on a nilmanifold G/ which is virtually cyclic and for which the factor map is affine, i.e. given by the composition of a left translation with a homomorphism. This is clearly the weakest assumption we can make, is algebraic in nature and therefore checkable. In this situation, we will say that 0 does not have an algebraic rank 1 factor.
Theorem 1.1. Let M = G/ be a compact nilmanifold with an action 0 of Zr for r  2 by automorphisms of G. Assume that 0 does not have an algebraic rank 1 factor. Then for some positive integer k (depending only on the dimension of G), any Ck-small C perturbation  of 0 is C-conjugate to 0.
Rank 1 factors are closely tied to ergodicity properties. Indeed, Rodriguez Hertz and Wang show in [RHW14] that non-existence of an algebraic rank 1 factor condition for actions by commuting nil-automorphisms on a compact nilmanifold is equivalent to the existence of a Z2 subgroup of Zk for which all non-trivial elements act ergodically. This extends results by Starkov in the toral case [Sta99] - cf. Proposition 2.1.
To handle nilmanifolds we introduce a new method which combines exponential mixing of the unperturbed action with a KAM approach. The latter usually is done for dynamical systems on tori and heavily uses Fourier analysis, especially the fast decay of Fourier coefficients of smooth functions on tori. This is not available to us. In fact the harmonic analysis for nilmanifolds is complicated and and not easily used. Instead, we use the exponential mixing results for commuting groups of
2

ergodic automorphisms of nilmanifolds by Gorodnik and the first author [GS15] which are based on the polynomial equidistribution results of Green and Tao [GT12a].
We use a KAM iteration as in [DK10a] - with some important differences. First, the iteration involves solving approximate linearized conjugacy equations by suitably smooth functions. With exponential mixing, a priori we can only get solutions which are dual to suitable spaces of Hölder functions. The exponential mixing however gives us partial derivatives of arbitrarily high order which are still dual to the same spaces. This is motivated by arguments from [FKS13, RHW14]. There however, the cohomology equation is solved over the non-linear action and the regularity of the distributions is controlled along certain foliations. In the partially hyperbolic case, we do not know exponential mixing for the perturbed action as there is no Hölder conjugacy between perturbed and original action a priori. When trying to do this for the KAM scheme, the transversal regularity unfortunately becomes uncontrollable. This forced us to consider derivatives along the whole manifold.
Acknowledgements: We are deeply grateful to Jeffrey Rauch who helped us understand regularity properties of distributions, and even proved general results on our behalf. Regrettably, in the end we did not use these though. We further are grateful to Danijela Damjanovic for a number of helpful conversations. We thank Yunfeng Shi for his reference to a paper by Salamon on an interpolation result, Jianjun Liu for help with KAM arguments and Zhiyuan Zhang for bringing this problem to our attention.
1.1. Notation. In this paper, we employ the Vinogradov and Bachmann­Landau notation: for functions f and positive-valued functions g, we write f  g or f = O(g) if there exists a constant C such that |f |  Cg pointwise, and write f  g if f  g and g  f .
We denote by d the dimension of G and by g the Lie algebra of G; exp : g  G and log : G  g will denote the exponential map and logarithm map respectively.
2. Preliminaries
In this section we recall some facts about algebraic actions as well as basic facts on interpolation, Sobolev spaces and smoothing operators.
2.1. Algebraic Preliminaries and Exponential Mixing. We will recall some general facts about actions by nil-automorphisms.
First, Rodriguez-Hertz and Wang [RHW14, Lemma 2.9] generalized work by Starkov [Sta99] to nilmanifolds:
Proposition 2.1. Suppose 0 is a Zr action on a nilmanifold G/ by nil-automorphisms without algebraic rank 1 factor. Then there is a Z2 subgroup of Zr for which all non-trivial elements act ergodically.
In the proof of the main result, Theorem 1.1, we will combine this characterization of existence of algebraic rank 1 factors. with the the following exponential mixing result from [GS15]. It will allows us to define converging series in a suitable space of distributions which will be the basis for starting the KAM procedure.
Proposition 2.2. Suppose 0 is a Zr action on a nilmanifold G/ by nil-automorphisms such the all nontrivial elements of Zr act ergodically wrt Haar measure. Then there exists a constant  = (0) > 0 such that for any f, g  C(G/) with zero integrals and any a  Zr,
f  a, g  e- a f C g C .
3

Finally, we recall Walter's characterization of centralizers of ergodic nil-automorphisms and more generally affine maps [Wal70, Corollary 1]. We recall that an affine map of a nilmanifold N/ is the composition of an automorphism with a left translation.
Proposition 2.3. A homeomorphism centralizing an ergodic affine map of a compact nilmanifold G/ is affine.
We will need this to compare solutions in different Sobolev spaces so that they all have the same regularity in the end (cf. Remark 3.2).

2.2. Interpolation of Pointwise Derivatives: Interpolation theory gives multiplicative control of intermediate derivatives Djf of an k times differentiable function f : R  R in terms of f and Df where j < k, generalizing Landau's famous inequality f  2  4 f · f  . While this is usually generalized using Sobolev norms, we will use a more direct estimate from [Sal04, Lemma 5], inspired by work of Moser.
We let j denote the j'th partial derivative, and for a multi-index  = (i1, . . . ik), let || := k, and denote by D the concatenation of all the il derivatives. Denote by Cs(Rn) the space of s-times continuously differentiable functions on Rn with bounded derivatives Df for   s. Denoting the sup norm by |f |C0, we endow Cs(Rn) with the | |Cs norm:
|f |Cs := |D|C0 .
s
Lemma 2.4. For every n  N and every l > 0, there is a constant c = c(l, n) > 0 such that for all f, g  Cl(Rn) and all k  m  l:
|f |lC-mk  c|f |lC-km|f |mCl-k.
Proof. We mimic the proof of [Sal04, Lemma 5]. The main difference is that our functions are defined on Rn, not T n. To deduce the claim for a function f : Rn  R, consider p  Rn and pick a bump function g supported in a unit box B around p. Then g · f is supported on B, and naturally defines a function on T n. Then

|g · f |lC-mk  c|g · f |lC-km |g · f |mCl-k. Since |g · f |Cj  G|f |Cj for a constant G depending on g and l for all 0  j  l, we get
|g · f |lC-mk  cG2|f |lC-km |f |mCl-k. Since g  1 in a neighborhood of p, the claim follows easily where c is replaced by c G2.

Note: In principle one can keep track of the dependence of the constant c = c(l, n) on l. One

simply has to estimate derivatives of bump functions.


For

example

if

f (x)

=

exp(

a 1-x2

),

then

|f (n)|  ( 2n e 18 )2n) · n!. Similarly if n > 1, we can take products of the one-dimensional bump

functions.

This could be used directly in the KAM convergence arguments that the solutions are smooth.

We will argue this more indirectly, show that KAM scheme convergence on any fixed level of

differentiability, and then use essential uniqueness of the solution to conclude the solution is actually C.

2.3. Preliminaries on Sobolev Spaces: We refer the reader to [Tay11] and [Zim90] for detailed
expositions on Sobolev theory. We denote the space of essentially bounded measurable functions on Rn by L(Rn) and endow
it with the usual L norm. For a multi-index  = (1, . . . , n) of non-negative integers and x := (x1, . . . , xn)  Rn, set x := x11 . . . xnn. As usual, we call a smooth function f  C(Rn) rapidly decreasing if xDf  L(Rn) for multi-indices ,  with all i, i  0. We denote the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing functions on Rn by S(Rn). We topologize S(Rn) by the family of semi-norms pk(f ) := ||m supxRn x k|Df | to obtain a Fréchet space. We call continuous linear functionals on S(Rn) a tempered distributions, denote the space of all such by S(Rn) by S(Rn) and endow it with the weak topology.
Let L2(Rd) denote the space of square integrable functions defined on Rd. Then L2(Rd) is a
Hilbert space with inner product ·, · L2 :

(2.1)

f, g L2 := f (x)g(x)dx, for f, g  L2(Rd).
Rd

For a positive integer m, we define

(2.2)

Hm(Rd) := {f  L2(Rd) : Df  L2(Rd) for any ||  m}.

Then Hm(Rd) is a Hilbert space with the inner product ·, · Hm :

(2.3)

f, g Hm :=

Df, Dg L2 and norm f Hm := ( f, f Hm )1/2.

||m

The usual Fourier transform defines a continuous linear operator F on S(Rn) and by duality on S(Rn). Fourier transform converts differentiation into multiplication. This allows us to extend the definition of Hm(Rd) from positive integers to all real values s  R:

(2.4)

Hs(Rd) := {f  S(Rd) : (1 +  2)s/2f^  L2(Rd)},

where f^ denotes the Fourier transform of f and  = (12 + · · · + n2)1/2. Then Hs(Rd) is a Hilbert space where the inner product ·, · Hs is given as follows:

(2.5)

f, g Hs := (1 +  2)s/2f^, (1 +  2)s/2g^ L2 .

Moreover, we have that

(2.6)

(Hs(Rd)) = H-s(Rd).

From (2.5) it is easy to see the following:

Lemma 2.5. For any s  R and positive integer k, if f  Hs(Rd) satisfies that for any differential operator D of order ||  k, Df  Hs(Rd) and Df Hs  g(k) for some constant g(k) > 0, then f  Hs+k(Rd) and f Hs+k  g(k) where the implicit constant only depends on d.
Proof. The assumption that f  Hs(Rd) and Df  Hs(Rd) for any differential operator D of order ||  k implies by definition that f  Hs+k(Rd). Control of the Hs+k-norms is achieved by their definition and expanding (1 +  2)s/2+k/2 on the Fourier transform side. The latter becomes
a sum of products i1 . . . il with l  s + k and coefficients coming from the binomial theorem. Since all norms f Hs+I , l  s are bounded by g(k), the claim is immediate.

We will further need the Sobolev embedding theorem:
5

Theorem 2.6 (see [Zim90, Theorem 5.2.4]). For any k  N, if f  Hk+1+d/2(Rd), then f  Ck(Rd) and for
f Ck  f Hk+1+d/2 where the implicit constant does not depend on f .

2.4. Convolution and Smoothing operators: Below we will use a KAM scheme in our argu-
ments. This will employ smoothing procedures using convolution. Let us briefly review some basic
facts. Let   C(Rd) be a smooth function supported on B1(0) with dx = 1. For J > 1, let us
denote J (x) := Jd(Jx). For f  L2(Rd), let us denote

(2.7)

SJ f := f  J

to be the convolution of f and J . Then by standard facts on convolution (cf. e.g. [GS14, Lemma
2.3] and its proof), we have the following: if f  Cs(Rd), then for any J > 0, any s > 0 and 0 < s < s,

(2.8)

SJ f Cs+s  J d+s f Cs ,

and

(2.9)

SJ f - f Cs-s  J d-s f Cs ,

where in both inequalities, the implicit constants only depend on  and s.

3. Outline of Argument

Let M = G/ be a compact nilmanifold with an action 0 of Zr for r  2 by automorphisms of G, as in Theorem 1.1. Since 0 does not admit an algebraic rank 1 factor, by Proposition 2.1, there exists a subgroup   Zr isomorphic to Z2, such that every element in  acts ergodically on
G/. Then by Proposition 2.2, there exists a constant  > 0 such that for any a  , and any f, g  C(G/) with zero integrals,

(3.1)

f  a, g  e- a f C g C .

We will use this exponential mixing on  to define distributions (generalized functions) which will converge in a suitable Sobolev space (dual to Hölder functions).

3.1. Basic Overall KAM Strategy. Let us first review the KAM approach to prove local rigidity.

Rather than directly constructing a conjugacy, one successively finds conjugacies which bring the

action closer to the given algebraic action with an error term that is quadratically small in the

previous one. One shows that this process converges to the unperturbed action.

To be more precise, fix a right invariant Riemannian metric g0 on G and endow G/ with the

quotient metric, also denoted by g0. Fix a finite generating set  of Zr. We consider a Ck-close

C perturbation  of 0. By this we mean any C action  of Zr such that for all a  , (a) and

0(a) are Ck-close for a k to be determined later.

The goal is to show that  is C-conjugate to 0. Since G/ is compact, the injectivity radius i0

of

G/

is

positive.

We

will

first

assume

that

for

all

a



,

(a)

are

i0 2

close

to

0(a)

in

the

C 0 -metric

(w.r.t. the given fixed metric g0).

For a   and x  G/, let us denote

(3.2)

(a)x = exp(R(a, x))0(a)x
6

where exp : g  G is the Lie theoretic exponential map and R(a, ·) : G/  g is the unique error term with d(exp(R(a, x)), 1) < i0/2. Note that R(a, .) is a C-function on G/. Let us consider h of the form
h(x) = exp((x))x,

where  : G/  g. Assume that h is a diffeomorphism. Then we obtain a new action by conjugating 1 = h-1    h with a new error term

R(1)(a, x) = log(1(a)x(0(a)x)-1)

for a  Zr and x  G/. We want to find a smooth  such that the new error term R(1) is much
smaller than R, for a  . By repeating this process, we will get a sequence of C conjugacies, {h1, h2, . . . , hn, . . . }. We
then show that the limit

h

:=

lim
n

h1



h2



·

·

·



hn

is a C diffeomorphism and that

0 = h-1    h.

It will clearly suffice to do this for a  .

3.2. Exponential Mixing. The main difference to the more usual KAM approaches lies in combining the general overall strategy above with exponential mixing. This extends the use of Fourier series for tori from [DK10a]. However, it does not use the representation theory of nilpotent groups. Rather we use the exponential mixing results for commuting automorphisms of nilmanifolds [GS15, GS14]. There the Diophantine conditions are hidden as they follow from Diophantine properties of unstable eigenspaces of such automorphisms. In the end, they use the equidistribution properties of polynomial sequences from [GT12b] which depend on Diophantine conditions. Furthermore, in this paper we work with the Lie algebra rather than the nilpotent group. The main advantage is that the Lie algebra is a direct sum of the common generalized eigenspaces of the automorphisms.
Let us first set up some notation. For F : G/  g = Rd and a  Zr, we set

(3.3)

aF = 0(a)F - F  0(a).

For any two maps F1, F2 : G/  g = Rd and a, b  Zr, we set

(3.4)

La,b(F1, F2) := bF1 - aF2.

The induced action of 0 on g admits the following decomposition into generalized eigenspaces:

g = V


where  is the collection of characters  : Zr  R such that

V =

vg:

lim log
a 

0(a)v a

- (a) = 0

is nontrivial. For a function F : G/  g, let F denote its projection onto V. Recall that Proposition 2.1 gives a subgroup  = Z2 of Zr consisting of ergodic elements. For
  , we choose a   such that

(3.5)

1  a|V  e/2.
7

We will work with the same elements a at each step of the KAM iteration. This is fine since the condition on the a is in terms of the unperturbed action 0. Let 0 :=   {a|  }. For any norm · on functions on G/, set

(3.6)

R := max R(a, ·)
a0

where R(a, .) is the error term defined as in equation 3.2. Denoting, as above, the projection to V by R(a, ·), choose a large J > 1 and set

(3.7)

SR := SJ R(a, ·).

Note that SR still takes values in V. Then for any k  N, we get from the smoothing bound 2.8

(3.8)

SR Ck+k  J d+k R Ck

where the implied constants depend only on the smoothing and k.

Remark: We note that the implied constants may explode uncontrollably as k increases. Therefore, we work with a fixed smoothness k + k, prove convergence of the KAM sequence in the Ck+k topology. This will give us a conjugation k+k in Ck+k. Since conjugations are unique up to affine

maps by Proposition 2.3, the k+k conjugacy will agree with k+k+1 up to an affine map. Hence k+k is Ck+k+1, and thus C by an induction.
Let us choose  = min( R C0, e/4 - 1) where  is chosen as in Equation 3.1. Then define the following:

+ = - 0(-(i + 1)a)SR  0(ia) for (a) = 0,

i=0

and

+ = - (1 + )-(i+1)0(-(i + 1)a)SR  0(ia) for (a) = 0;

i=0

and

-

- =

0(-(i + 1)a)SR  0(ia) for (a) = 0,

i=-1

and
-

- =

(1 + )-(i+1)0(-(i + 1)a)SR  0(ia) for (a) = 0.

i=-1

At this point, these definitions are formal. We can however view them as distributions using the exponential mixing from Lemma 3.1. Moreover, each + defines a Hölder function. Indeed, for (a) > 0, the power series defining + converges in the space of Hölder functions (for some exponent ). For (a) = 0 this remains true thanks to the extra (1 + )-(i+1) factor on each term.
Remark:. If we chose  = 0 in the latter case, we would still get distributions + and -. However, in the proof of Lemma 3.1 we need to use exponential mixing which we only have for

Hölder functions, not for distributions.

Lemma 3.1. We have


(1 + ())-i-10(-(i + 1)a)SR  0(ia) = 0,

i=-

where () each - is

distributions. Hence set  =   =

 +.

8

Proof. By choice of a, each + is a Hölder function. First note by telescoping sums that +  a - (1 + ())0(a)  + = SR. Therefore, as distributions we have
N

Lemma 3.2. Let S = {X1, . . . , Xd} be a basis of g such that every Xi belongs to some generalized eigenspace.Then every differential operator D of order || on M can be written as

D =

aj Di

where every aj is uniformly bounded and every Di is of the form DXl1 · · · DXl|| for suitable Xlj  S.

Proof. This easily follows from an induction, expressing general vectorfields in terms of the Xj. If X = bjXj and Y = cjXj for suitable C functions bj and cj, then DX DY = ai(Xi(bj))DYj + aibj DXi DXj .

The following lemma is the key to our main result:

Lemma 3.3. For any differential operator D, we have

Moreover, for any given k > 0 and any D with order ||  k - 1,

Proof. As the second statement implies the first, it suffices to prove the second statement. Moreover,

note that it suffices to prove the statement for  for any .

By Lemma 3.2, it suffices to show the statement for D of the form DXl1 · · · DXl|| with Xli  Vi

and ||  k - 1. We can assume that |

without

Indeed,

if

the

opposite inequality holds, by Lemma 3.1 we can use the expression - for  and iterate backwards. Then for any f  C(G/) and any i  Z, we have


D, f = - (1 + ())-i-1 D(0(-(i + 1)a)SR  0(ia)), f .
i=0

As 0(-(i + 1)a) acts on V linearly, we have that

D(0(-(i + 1)a)SR  0(ia)) = 0(-(i + 1)a)D(SR  0(ia)).

Note that D0(ia) acts linearly on V|| with generalized eigenvalue i||(a). Then it follows from the Jordan normal form that

0(ia)Xl|| = i||(a)p||(i)Y|i |
where p||(i) is a polynomial of degree bounded by d and Y|i|  V|| is a vector of norm 1. Therefore
DXl|| SR  0(ia) = i||(a)p||(i)(DY|i| SR)  0(ia).
9

By repeating this argument for DXl||-1 , . . . , DXl1 , we get

 ||

D(SR  0(ia)) =  j(a) pi(i)(Di SR)  0(ia),

We will now follow the basic KAM Strategy 3.1 and conjugate  by the candidate suggested by our previous discussion. Setting h(x) = exp((x))x. If  C1 is small enough then h is a diffeomorphism. That this can be arranged for a small enough perturbation follows from Proposition 3.4. we obtain a new action 1 = h-1    h. We will estimate the new error term
R(1)(a, x) = log(1(a)x(0(a)x)-1)
for a  0 and x  G/. As for the definition of the initial error term R(a, x), we assume that R(1)(a, ·) : G/  g is the unique term with d(exp(R(1)(a, x)), 1) < i0/2.
We first consider the C0 norm of R(1)(a, ·). First note that

1(a)x = exp(R(1)(a, x))0(a)x,

(a)x = exp(R(a, x))0(a)x,

h(x) = exp((x))x

and h(1(a)x) = (a)(h(x)). We get

exp((1(a)x))(exp(R(1)(a, x)))0(a)x = exp(R(a, h(x))) exp(0(a)(x))0(a)x.

Therefore,

exp((1(a)x))(exp(R(1)(a, x))) = exp(R(a, h(x))) exp(0(a)(x)).

Note that G is nilpotent. By taking logarithm on both sides, we have

(1(a)x) + R(1)(a, x) + I = R(a, h(x)) + 0(a)(x) + II.

Here, by the well-known Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula I = [(1(a)x), R(1)(a, x)] + · · ·
has finitely many terms consisting of Lie brackets of (1(a)x) and R(1)(a, x), and

II = [R(a, h(x)), 0(a)(x)] + · · ·

similarly has finitely many terms consisting of Lie brackets of R(a, h(x)) and 0(a)(x). Note that  C0  J R C0 by Proposition 3.4 and the definition of R(1). Since [x, y]  x y for any x, y  g, we have
I C0   C0 R(1)(a, ·) C0  J  R C0 R(1)(a, ·) C0

and Given that

Note that

R(a, h(x)) + 0(a)(x) - (1(a)x) =((0(a)x) - (1(a)x)) + (R(a, h(x)) - R(a, x)) + (R(a, x) - (0(a)x) + 0(a)(x)).

Therefore,

R(a, h(x)) + 0(a)(x) - (1(a)x) C0  (0(a)x) - (1(a)x) C0 + R(a, h(x)) - R(a, x) C0 + R(a, x) - (0(a)x) + 0(a)(x) C0 .
To sum up, we have

Lemma 3.6.

(0(a)x) - (1(a)x) C0   C1 R(1)(a, ·) C0 .

Proof. The estimate easily follows from mean value theorem. In fact, by the mean value theorem,

(0(a)x) - (1(a)x) C0   C1 d(0(a)x, 1(a)x)   C1 R(1)(a, ·) C0 .

By the mean value theorem, we also have the following estimate: Since we are close to the identity, the derivative of the exponential map can be controlled by a constant as close to 1 as we wish.

Lemma 3.7.

R(a, h(x)) - R(a, x) C0  R C1  C0 .

To estimate R(a, x) - ((0(a)x) - 0(a)(x)) C0 , we first consider its projections onto V:

Remark We need the following estimates to prove Lemma 3.8. We strongly use commutativity
of the acting group here as it allows us to compare the error terms for the a and a. They are all quadratically small in the error terms of the previous step. This will force the sequence of actions in the KAM scheme to converge for all a  0, and thus yield a Ck conjugacy between  and 0.

Proof. Note that (a)(a)x = (a)(a)x. The left hand side equals

exp(R(a, (a)x))0(a)(a)x = exp(R(a, (a)x))0(a) exp(R(a, x))0(a)x = exp(R(a, (a)x)) exp(0(a)R(a, x))0(a)0(a)x.

Similarly, the right hand side equals

exp(R(a, (a)x)) exp(0(a)R(a, x))0(a)0(a)x. Since 0(a)0(a)x = 0(a)0(a)x, we have
exp(R(a, (a)x)) exp(0(a)R(a, x)) = exp(R(a, (a)x)) exp(0(a)R(a, x)). By taking logarithm on both sides and applying the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, we get

R(a, (a)x) + 0(a)R(a, x) + I = R(a, (a)x) + 0(a)R(a, x) + II,

where

I = [R(a, (a)x), 0(a)R(a, x)] + · · ·

has finitely many terms of Lie brackets of R(a, (a)x) and 0(a)R(a, x), and

II = [R(a, (a)x), 0(a)R(a, x)] + · · ·

Proof of Lemma 3.8. First note that (0(a)x) - 0(a)(x) = -a, and

R(a, x) = (1 + ())-i-10(-(i + 1)a)~ a R(a, ·)  0(ia),
i=0

where

~ aR(a, ·) = (1 + ())0(a)R(a, ·) - R(a, ·)  0(a) = aR(a, ·) + ()0(a)R(a, ·).

Then the quantity in the statement of Lemma 3.7 is equal to


R(a, x) + a = R(a, x) - (1 + ())-i-10(-(i + 1)a)aSR  0(ia)
i=0 
= (1 + ())-i-10(-(i + 1)a)(~ a R(a, ·) - aSR)  0(ia)

Using exponential mixing property of 0(a) (Proposition 2.2) applied to the series in the last

This completes the proof.

We then consider the Ck¯+k~ norm of h and R(1)(a, ·) for any given k¯, k~  0. It is here that we use crucially that the underlying group is nilpotent.

Lemma 3.12. Let k¯, k~  0 be nonnegative integers. We have

h Ck¯+k~  J +k¯ R Ck~

and for a  0

R(1)(a, ·) Ck¯+k~  J +k¯ R Ck~ .

Proof. Note that we use coordinate system on g. Since G is nilpotent, the product

exp((x))x = exp(P ((x), log x))

where P (·) is a polynomial in coordinates of (x) and log x. Hence we get the Ck¯+k~ norm of

log h(x) = P ((x), log x) is  by  J +k¯ R Ck~ .

 . Ck¯+k~ By Proposition 3.4, we can estimate the last term further

Then since 1 = h-1 h and R(1)(a, x) = log((1(a)x)-10(a)x), we can use the same argument

as in the error estimate for the inductive step [DK10b, Section 5.2] to conclude that for a  0

R(1)(a, ·) Ck¯+k~  J +k¯ R Ck~ .

4. KAM Iteration

In this section, we will use a fairly standard KAM scheme and the estimates from previous section
to finish the proof.
Starting from , we can use the previous argument to construct 1(x), h1(x) = exp(1(x))x and 1 = h-1 1    h1. For n  1, suppose n has been constructed. Then by repeating the same construction with  replaced by n, we get n+1(x), hn+1(x) = exp(n(x))x, and n+1 = h-n+1 1  n  hn+1.
For any fixed k  0, let us denote n = (3/2)n , kn = min{k + n, k + k}. Suppose n(a)x = exp(R(n)(a, x))0(a)x and we have the following estimates:

(4.1)

R(n) C0  n;

(4.2)

R(n) Ckn  -n 1.

R(n+1) Ckn+1  Jn+1 R(n) Ckn .

Given that k is large enough such that k  101( + 1), we have

Since hn+1(x) = exp(n(x))x,

log(hn+1(x)) = log x + n(x) + [ ],

where [ ] consists of finitely many terms of Lie brackets of log x and n(x). This implies that
hn+1 - Id C  n C  n1/8.
This implies that the limit hk, = limn hk+1  · · ·  hn+1 converges in C(G/). Since hn  C(G/) for all n  N, we have that h = h1  · · ·  hk  hk,  C(G/). Since R(n) C0  0, we have that
0 = h-1    h. By repeating the above KAM scheme with larger k, we can get a conjugacy h with arbitrarily high regularity. Since such a conjugacy is unique up to an affine automorphism by Proposition 2.3, we have that h  C(G/) and thus finish the proof.
