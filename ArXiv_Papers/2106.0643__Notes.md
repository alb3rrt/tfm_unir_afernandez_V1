## Abstract

Event generators in high-energy nuclear and particle physics play an important role in facilitating studies of particle reactions. We survey the state-of-the-art of machine learning (ML) efforts at building physics event generators. We review ML generative models used in ML-based event generators and their specific challenges, and discuss various approaches of incorporating physics into the ML model designs to overcome these challenges. Finally, we explore some open questions related to super-resolution, fidelity, and extrapolation for physics event generation based on ML technology.
