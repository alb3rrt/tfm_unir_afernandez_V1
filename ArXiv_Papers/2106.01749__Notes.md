## Abstract

Perron's method and Wiener's criterion have entirely solved the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation. Since then, this approach has attracted the attention of many mathematicians for applying these ideas in the more general equations. So, in this paper, we extend the Perron method and the Wiener criterion to the $G(\cdot)$-Laplace equation.
