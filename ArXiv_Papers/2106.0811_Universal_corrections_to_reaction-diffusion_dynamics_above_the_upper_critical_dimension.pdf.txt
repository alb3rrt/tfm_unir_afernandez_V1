Reaction-diffusion models are common in many areas of statistical physics, where they describe the universal late-time dynamics of chemical reactions. Using a Bose gas representation, which maps the real-time dynamics of the reactants to the imaginary-time evolution of an interacting Bose gas, we consider corrections to the late-time scaling above the upper critical dimension, where mean-field theory sets the leading order. We establish that the leading corrections are not given by a small renormalization of the reaction rate due to memory effects, but instead set by higher-order correlation functions that capture memory effects of sub-clusters of reactants. Drawing on methods developed for ultracold quantum gases and nuclear physics, we compute these corrections exactly for various k-particle annihilation processes kA   with k > 2.

I. INTRODUCTION

Reaction-diffusion models describe the stochastic dynamics of particles that spread diffusively and undergo local chemical reactions [1­3]. They are ubiquitous in statistical physics where they describe, for example, the dynamics of chemical reactions [4], predator-prey populations [5, 6], or pattern formation [7]. In particular, the specific case of k-particle annihilation

with a reaction rate  describes processes such as the recombination of excitons in semiconductors [8], monopole annihilation in models of the early universe [9], reactions in polymer melts [10, 11], or the dynamics of domain walls [12]. Historically, this model was first investigated in a statistical physics context by von Smoluchowski to describe the coagulation kinetics in colloidal gold suspensions [13, 14]. Of interest for annihilation processes like Eq. (1) is the late-time dynamics of the reactant density n(t) that characterizes the decay to the empty state [9, 15­17]. This dynamics is universal, i.e., independent of the initial reactant distribution or the shortdistance structure of the system (such as, for example, an underlying lattice on which the particles move or a microscopic reaction potential). However, it depends sensitively on the space dimension d, since above an upper critical dimension dc = 2/(k - 1) [15, 18] diffusion is efficient to level out spatial depletion zones that form as particles annihilate, whereas below that it is not [10]. The first case d > dc defines the reaction-limited regime, where the density is (to a first approximation) homogeneous and solves a mean-field rate equation [2, 3]

independent of the initial density [3, 19]. The second case d < dc defines the diffusion-limited regime, where the density is strongly inhomogeneous and particles must first diffuse across a depletion zone to react. This process is slower than the mean-field decay and leads to a scaling n(t)  (Dt)-d/2 that is independent of the reaction rate  (here, D is the diffusion constant), with n(t)  [(ln t)/Dt]1/(k-1) at the critical dimension. Experimentally, diffusion-limited scaling has been observed in exciton recombination in semiconductors [8, 20­24]. Theoretical work predominantly considers the diffusion-limited regime using renormalization group methods [9, 16, 18, 25, 26], mappings to integrable models in one dimension [12, 27­29], and numerical simulations [15, 17, 30­33], which for integer dimensions describes the case (k, d) = (2, 1) as well as (2, 2) and (3, 1) with marginal scaling. By comparison, scaling in the reaction-limited regime appears less explored beyond the mean-field equation (2), even though it describes most parameter combinations.
The aim of this paper is to derive the corrections to mean-field scaling (3) above the upper critical dimension d > dc. By the argument given above, one could assume that this correction is set by a perturbative renormalization of the reaction rate  due to the formation of depletion regions. In detail, such a perturbation describes a memory effect that accounts for a reduction in the reactant density if the k reactants have already met at some point in the past and annihilated. We show here that this is not correct. Instead, the leading-order scaling corrections are set by memory effects that account for a reactant depletion due to sub-clusters of l < k reactants having reacted in the past with other particles, which are processes that involve a total particle number larger than k. A quantitative discussion reveals two separate scaling regimes, which are summarized in Fig. 1: Right above the critical dimension, the corrections are perturbative and describe a single past memory event, which leads to a scaling n(t)  t-d/2, whereas for even higher dimensions, such terms must be summed to all orders, which gives a non-perturbative correction

FIG. 1. Asymptotic scaling behavior of reaction-diffusion processes with local k-particle annihilation as a function of the space dimension d. The continuous black line d = dc = 2/(k - 1) marks the boundary between the diffusion-limited regime with n(t)  t-d/2 and the reactionlimited regime with mean-field scaling n(t)  t-1/(k-1). Corrections to mean-field scaling are set by memory effects of sub-clusters of the k reactants, and they are either perturbative with n(t)  t-d/2 (light blue shaded area) or nonperturbative with n(t)  t-2/(k-1) (dark blue shaded area), with possible logarithmic scaling corrections at the interface d = 4/(k - 1) (black line). These corrections dominate over a simple renormalization of the reaction rate, except in the perturbative regime for k = 2 (green line), where they are of the same order.

n(t)  t-2/(k-1). In both regimes, the corrections are of higher order than the renormalization of the annihilation rate (at least for k > 2) and they also dominate over non-universal terms. Corrections to mean-field scaling are thus both universal and more pronounced than one might expect.
In deriving the scaling corrections, we make use of a representation of the reaction-diffusion system in terms of a bosonic Doi-Peliti path integral, which maps the process (1) to a non-relativistic Bose gas dual with nonhermitian k-particle contact interactions. In this description, the diffusion constant D corresponds to an inverse mass and the reaction rate  sets the strength of the interaction. Related (but not identical) models are used as effective field theories in atomic and nuclear physics, where they describe quantum gases of bosonic atoms or 4He [34, 35] as well as the scattering of neutrons or mesons [36]. In particular, higher-order processes that determine the leading-order corrections to mean-field scaling are linked to vertex functions that describe the scattering of more than k particles, and techniques to compute the three-body scattering amplitude in Bose quantum gases [37­39] are applied to the problem.
The paper is structured as follows: We begin in Sec. II with a discussion of the Doi-Peliti path integral. Next, in Sec. III, we derive a dynamical equation for the density using the effective action, which systematically includes beyond-mean-field corrections through the vertex functions. We establish a power-counting for these ver-

2
tex functions and show that the leading-order corrections to mean-field scaling stem from higher-order vertices. To obtain a universal result, i.e., a result that is independent of a short-distance cutoff, some vertex functions must be summed to all orders, which is done numerically for various decay processes and dimensions. Section IV contains a summary and outlook.

II. DOI-PELITI PATH INTEGRAL

We begin by introducing the representation of the reaction-diffusion system (1) in terms of a bosonic DoiPeliti path integral [40­42]. Reviews of the Doi-Peliti formalism and reaction-diffusion systems are found in Refs. [3, 19, 43­45], and of the effective field-theory description of Bose quantum gases in Refs. [35, 36].
To capture the dynamics of the process (1) beyond a mean-field approximation, consider the Master equation for the occupation probability P ({ni}; t),

which uses a bare annihilation rate g0 and is defined on a lattice with ni particles on site i (with additional terms that account for hopping, i.e. diffusion, between lattice sites). Here, the first term describes a gain as k particles annihilate at a site i with ni + k particles, and the second term describes a loss as k particles are removed from a state with ni particles at site i. Ultimately, we are interested in universal aspects of the model that do not depend on the lattice spacing a0. Next, define the state vector

|(t) = P ({nj}; t)|{nj} ,

(5)

{nj }

where |{nj} is a Fock state of {nj} particles, which is defined as |{nj} = j(aj)nj |0 with |0 the vacuum state and aj a bosonic creation operator that increases the particle number at site j by one. The state
vector obeys an imaginary-time Schr¨odinger equation t|(t) = -H|(t) with a non-hermitian Hamiltonian that does not involve combinatorial factors [3, 45]

H = g0 (1 - (ai )k)aki ,

where the first term represents the gain term in Eq. (4)
and the second term the loss term. The state |(t) then evolves as |(t) = e-Ht|0 with an initial state |0 . The average particle number at a lattice point r is
expressed in terms of the state vector as [43, 45]

where P| = 0| i eai is a coherent projection state. This form differs from the quantum-mechanical definition
of the expectation value, which involves the square of the
wave vector. Taking the continuum limit with a coupling g = a(0k-1)dg0, Eq. (7) is written as a coherent-state path integral,

Here,  is a bosonic field of length dimension -d whereas ¯ is dimensionless, and we include a diffusion term with
diffusion constant D (represented by hopping on the lat-
tice). If one identifies the diffusion constant with an inverse mass, D = 2/2m, the Doi-Peliti action (9) is sim-
ilar (but not identical) to the effective description of a dilute Bose quantum gas, for which the term g¯kk in
Eq. (9) describes the scattering of k bosons with a con-
tact interaction. The theories differ in the non-hermitian vertex -gk that would describe the annihilation of k bosons [46].
For further calculations, it is convenient to rewrite
the Doi-Peliti action with a non-dynamical auxiliary k-particle field d = k [36] through a Hubbard-
Stratonovich transformation of Eq. (9):

In addition, since the field operators are not normal-
ordered with respect to the projection state P|, it is cus-
tomary to perform a "Doi-shift" of the conjugate fields in the Doi-Peliti action (10) as ¯  1+¯ and d¯  1+d¯ [43]:

with source fields j and ¯j. Feynman rules for this the-

ory are as follows (adhering to the convention of Ref. [3],

which avoids symmetry factors in the action): Imagi-

nary time runs from the right to the left in a Feyn-

man diagram. Continuous lines represent single-particle

propagators, which carry a momentum label q and contribute a factor G0(t, q) = (t)e-Dq2t, and double lines
the non-dynamical field d, which contributes -(t)/g.

III. EFFECTIVE ACTION
The Doi-Peliti generating functional (12) is linked to an equation of motion for the density through the effective action, which systematically takes into account fluctuations. In this section, we work out the corrections to mean-field scaling using this formalism. We begin in Sec. III A by reproducing the mean-field result (3) and derive a first correction due to a k-particle memory effect, which however is not of leading order. As illustrated in Fig. 1, there are instead two distinct regions with different leading-order corrections: a perturbative correction, which involves a two-particle memory correction and which is derived in Sec. III B, and a non-perturbative correction, which involves a k - 1-particle memory correction and which is derived in Sec. III C.
The effective action is defined in terms of the generating functional Z[j, ¯j] by a Legendre transformation with respect to the field expectation values  =  and ¯ = ¯ [3, 47, 48]

where we assume homogenous field configurations in the following. The vertex functions ¯N¯,N describe oneparticle irreducible (1PI) processes with N ingoing and N¯ outgoing lines at zero momentum. In terms of the
Bose gas representation, they represent the 1PI scatter-
ing of an initial state with N bosons to a final state with N¯ bosons. The standard identities / = j and /¯ = ¯j then define an equation of motion for the fields ¯ and  by varying [¯ , ] in the absence of sources. The first variation with respect to  gives ¯ = 0, which
is required by probability conservation [43], and the variation with respect to ¯ gives an equation of motion for
the density n = |j,¯j=0:

 ¯ (t) ¯ ,j,¯j=0 = 0.

(15)

Note that only vertices with a single outgoing line (N¯ = 1) will contribute to the dynamical equation. In the following, we use the notation l for the vertex ¯1,l,
where the missing bar indicates that we separate all delta
functions in time.

A. Mean-field solution

The leading-order terms in the equation of motion (15)
that involve the smallest power of the density are set by the vertices 1 = -G-0 1 and k, which are shown in Fig. 3. The corresponding equation for the density reads:

t

tn = dt k(t - t )nk(t ),

(16)

0

where we omit a boundary term n¯(t) that sets the initial density n¯. In defining the vertex k, we separate a kparticle propagator that is indicated by a bold line in Fig. 3. The equation for k is

t
k(t) = -kg(t) - gk! dt k(t - t )Sk(t ), (17)
0

where k! is a symmetry factor for the different ways of combining the k boson lines in the loop integral [note that our definition of the vertex functions (14) implies that there is no symmetry factor associated with the ordering of the k ingoing lines], and the loop integral

which is called the memory function, is the diffusion propagator of k particles from one identical point in space to another identical point. Intuitively, the first term in Eq. (17) describes the reaction rate given a homogenous distribution of particles. The convolution integral then describes a memory effect that accounts for the depletion of the reactant density due to processes where k particles have already reacted in the past [10]. Following the discussion in the introduction, we expect that the first (second) term dominates above (below) the critical dimension. Equation (16) is solved using a Laplace transformation [10, 18]

sn(s) = k(s)[nk](s),

(19)

where we denote by [nk](s) the Laplace transform of nk(t). Using the convolution theorem, Eq. (17) forms
a geometric series that evaluates to

Here,  is a momentum space cutoff and we recall that dc = 2/(k - 1) is a function of k. There is a logarithmic divergence for d = dc and a power-law divergence for d > dc. This strong dependence on a short-distance scale r0 -1 indicates that the contact potential is not a well-defined reaction potential for d  dc. For k = 2 (dc = 2), this is linked to the lack of re-entrance for Brownian motion in higher dimensions [45], such that two
point particles starting at different positions will never
meet and thus never react unless the reaction potential
has a more complicated short-distance form with a finite
range r0 [13, 14]. However, as pointed out by de Gennes [10], at time and distance scales that are much larger than r02/D and r0, the annihilation vertex is still of the form (20) with an effective rate . Formally, for d > dc,

The effective rate  defines a characteristic length scale b via /D  b2(d-dc)/dc , which is called the capture radius
and which is (in principle) independent of r0 [10]. For d = dc, where g is dimensionless, the bare coupling is linked to a capture radius by dimensional transmutation as b = -1 exp[-2Dkdc/2/gk!], which is known as a
scale anomaly [49­51]. The renormalized vertex is

and no longer contains a strong cutoff dependence. Equa-
tion (23) is valid below d < 2dc, and additional logarithmic divergences appear at integer multiples of dc. They can be renormalized by including higher-order reaction
terms that include derivatives, but they will not contribute to the vertex function in the limit s  0, which is the one relevant in this paper. Note that the discus-
sion of universality in reaction-diffusion systems is similar
to that of universal scattering in quantum gases, where
Eq. (20) (analytically continued to real time) describes
the scattering T -matrix of two bosons via a contact inter-
action [35]. The renormalization then links the strength
of the contact interaction to the s-wave scattering length /D  a2(d-dc)/dc , which is the universal parameter that encodes all information about low-energy scattering via
a (possibly unknown) short-range potential.
To solve Eq. (19), impose the power-law scaling n(t) = At- at late times, which implies n(s) = A(1 - )s-1 and [nk](s) = Ak(1 - k)sk-1 at small s [at d = dc, use n(t) = A(ln t/t)]. Below d < dc, the vertex interpolates between the mean-field expression lims k(s) = -k at large s (small times) and the diffusion limit lims0 k(s)  -ks(dc-d)/dc at small s (late times). Thus, provided that (/D)n¯(dc-d)/d 1 -- i.e. in the universal regime
where the initial density is negligible -- the density
scaling will transition from a reaction-limited mean-field decay with exponent n(t)  (t)-1/(k-1) at early to the (slower) diffusion-limited decay with n(t)  (Dt)-d/2 at late times. In the special case d = dc, we find k(s  0)  k/(ln sb2/D) and n(t)  [(ln t)/t]1/(k-1), i.e., the mean-field result with a logarithmic scaling
correction. The scaling crossover below d < dc from the reaction-limited to the diffusion-limited regime has been
observed in exciton recombination in one-dimensional
carbon nanotubes [8]. However, an analogous crossover
for d > dc does not exist. To leading order at late times (small s), we have k(s) = -k, which reproduces the mean-field result (3), but since the memory function (21)

has negative sign, the vertex diverges as the scale is increased to s Db-2. This is known as a Landau pole [52], which marks the limit of the universal description. It is an artifact of the contact reaction potential and absent if a microscopic potential (such as hard-core potential) is used.
Nevertheless, Eq. (19) still sets a correction to the mean-field scaling that is obtained by expanding the vertex k(s) to leading order in . Expanding around the mean-field result n = n0 + n, the perturbation solves

sn(s) = -k2 [nk0-1n](s) - k(s)[nk0](s), (24)

where the external fields in the subleading term of the
vertex function are evaluated at the mean-field value. In real time, the solution is n(t) = Bt- with an exponent  = (k - 1)-1 + (d - dc)/dc.
Note that this scaling also follows from dimen-
sional analysis as the correction  is suppressed by O() compared to the mean-field equation and must be a function of the small dimensionless parameter /[D(Dt)(d-dc)/dc ] 1. In the next section, we estab-
lish that this k-particle memory term does not form the
leading correction to mean-field scaling, but that there
are higher-order corrections that describe memory effects
of sub-clusters of reactants.

B. Perturbative scaling corrections
It is straightforward to obtain higher-order vertices starting from any given vertex m by pinching a number of l < k (where k > 2) ingoing lines and fuse them to a k-particle line at an earlier time, which generates a contribution to the vertex m+k-l. These higher-order vertex functions account for memory effects that describe a reduction in the reactant density at a time t < t due to a sub-cluster of l particles having reacted in the past with k - l other reactants. To determine the order of the vertex contributions to the dynamical equation at small  for d > dc, we replace the bold k-particle line by its mean-field value - and use the mean-field scaling for the external fields. The contribution of this new vertex to the equation of motion is then suppressed by O((l-1)/(k-1)) < O() compared to the contribution of the original vertex. Note that this power-counting assumes that the vertices are finite, which is not always the case and will be revisited in the next section.
The first perturbative correction to the equation of motion constructed in this way (starting with the vertex k) is set by the vertex 2k-2, which includes the two-particle memory function and is shown in the first line of Fig. 4. It induces a correction to the mean-field result that is suppressed by O(1/(k-1)), which is of higher order than the

They are set by a second-order diagram that involves the three-particle memory function as well as three third-order diagrams that describe more complicated two-particle correlations. Perturbatively, there are at least k - 1 processes that are of higher-order than the simple O() mean-field correction discussed in the previous subsection.
The leading perturbative correction to the mean-field result is thus of order n  O(0), which implies

where the symmetry factor accounts for two fusion vertices and the k(k - 1) ways of connecting the lines in the loop integral. In d = 1 (which is the relevant dimension
for the perturbative correction) we have Bk=4 = 0.62 and Bk=5 = 1.60.
Note that the above power-counting for higher-order
vertices does not apply for k = 2 (where dc = 2). An example of a leading-order correction is the vertex 3, which is of order O(3) and shown in Fig. 5 [note that a hypothetical O(2) diagram similar to Fig. 4 with one internal line is not 1PI]. In d = 3, this vertex evaluates

and its contribution to the equation of motion will be suppressed by O() compared to the mean-field term. The vertex 4 induces a correction of the same order. Unlike for k > 2, they are of the same order as the correction to the mean-field decay rate obtained by expanding the vertex 2. Note that a similar mixing of different contributions in the effective action approach was noted by Lee [18], where taking into account the vertex correction alone for k = 2 leads to a decay amplitude below dc at variance with renormalization group calculations. In the following, we focus on the case k > 2, where the power-counting is set by higher-order vertices.

C. Non-perturbative corrections

The perturbative results discussed in the previous section will apply if the memory functions S2, S3, . . . , Sk-1 that appear in the vertices 2k-2, 2k-3, . . . are finite. While the k-particle memory function Sk is always finite above the critical dimension, this is only true for other memory functions if dc < d < 2/(k - 2). In higher dimensions, some (or indeed all for d  2) of them may contain logarithmic or power-law divergences, starting at d = 2/(k - 2) with a logarithmic divergence in the vertex k+1. Such a cutoff-dependence can have at least three different implications for scaling: (a) It can indicate that beyond-mean-field corrections are not universal. (b) If a strong cutoff-dependence can be removed by further renormalization, the scaling corrections are universal but depend on other parameters in addition to . (c) If the divergence is only superficial, summing the vertex to all orders will give a manifestly finite result.
Our calculations indicate that the latter case applies, i.e., the vertices summed to all order are finite and only depend on . Since in this case the only time-dependence is introduced by the external fields in the effective action, the leading non-perturbative correction to meanfield scaling is set by the vertex k+1, which (by dimensional analysis) scales as O(1+d/(d(k-1)-2)). This implies

with a numerical coefficient Bk that will be determined in the following. Provided that d > 4/(k - 1), the nonperturbative contribution of the vertex k+1 to the equation of motion dominates over the perturbative correction
discussed in the previous section.

FIG. 6. Bethe-Salpeter equation for the k + 1-body vertex that contributes to the scaling correction above the critical dimension.

In general, it is not possible to sum a vertex with more than k ingoing lines to all orders. To determine the vertex k+1, however, we apply methods developed for cold quantum gases to compute the three-body scattering matrix exactly [37­39] (for a review, see Ref. [36]). The first three terms that contribute to the vertex k+1 are shown in Fig. 6(a) [note that for k = 2, the first term is not 1PI, and the vertex function starts with the second term]. These diagrams are summed to all orders using a vertex that is implicitly defined as shown in Fig. 6(b). Unlike the k-particle vertex k, this is not a geometric series but represents an integral equation, which is given by:

k+1(S|Sa, p) = (-)2k!k2Sk-1(S - Sa, p)

× k2(k - 1)!Sk-1(S - Sa - s, p + q). (31)

Here, the vertex is a function of a total frequency S, the frequency of the ingoing particle line Sa as well as a relative momentum p between the ingoing particle and the k-particle line. The inhomogeneous term in the integral equation Eq. (31) corresponds to the first diagram in Fig. 6(a) or (b), where k! is a symmetry factor for the different ways of combining the internal loop lines, and an additional factor of k2 stems from the two fusion vertices, cf. Fig. 2. The homogenous term of the integral equation corresponds to the second term in Fig. 6(b). It involves the vertex function with loop frequency s and momentum q, a single-particle propagator as well as the k-particle propagator, which as before is replaced by its mean-field value -. In addition, the integrand contains the memory function for k - 1 particles as a subdiagram, where k2(k - 1)! is now a symmetry factor that accounts for different ways of combining the lines in the loop and the ingoing and outgoing line.
The frequency integration is evaluated using the residue theorem, which picks up the pole at s = -Dq2.

To determine the running of the vertex at a small mo-
mentum or frequency scale µ, we set the ingoing par-
ticle frequency equal to its value at the diffusion pole, Sa = -Dp2, as well as S = 0, such that µ = |p| [37]. This gives:

k+1(p) = (-)2k!k2Sk-1(Dp2, p)

The loop-angle integral over Sk-1 is performed in closed analytical form. The resulting one-dimensional integral equation is a Fredholm equation of the second kind that is solved using numerical standard algorithms such as the Nystrom method [53] (for an introduction to the method applied to the three-body problem in ultracold quantum gases, see [54]). The integral equation is solved taking into account a momentum range q  [0, ] while retaining the explicit (divergent) cutoff-dependence in the integration kernel and the inhomogeneous term.
Figure 7 shows result for k+1(p = µ) for a range of dimensions d = 1, 2, 3 and parameters k = 3, 4, 5, where we exclude the case (k, d) = (3, 1) as this is the marginal dimension for this process. As is apparent from the figure, the vertex functions are finite and strongly suppressed at large µ. We checked that the solution is independent of the cutoff scale and takes a scaling form that depends only on a dimensionless scaling variable µ(/D)dc/2(d-dc). This confirms the power-counting established at the beginning of the section. The perturbation solves

tn = -k2nk0-1n + k+1(µ = 0)nk0+1(t), (33)

which reproduces the result (30) with Bk = k+1(µ = 0)d/(d(k-2)-2)/(k(k - 2)[k(k - 1)]1/(k-1)). The static

limit k+1(µ = 0) is indicated in Fig. 7 by the red dashed line.

For two parameter choices (k, d) = (4, 1) and (k, d) =

(3, 2), the integral equation sums a logarithmic diver-

gence of the memory function Sk-1 [cf. Eq. (21)]. At small , we find for (k, d) = (4, 1)

While the vertex 5 is sub-leading compared to the perturbative result (which is set by the vertex 6 instead), it sets the leading-order correction at (k, d) = (3, 2). Solving the equation of motion including this logarithmic correction gives instead of Eq. (30)

which contains a logarithmic correction in time, too. Note that beyond the leading-order term, there can be additional non-universal corrections that include the range of the reaction potential [37, 55, 56].
IV. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Is summary, we have discussed beyond-mean field corrections to the late-time dynamics of absorptive reactiondiffusion processes with k-particle annihilation. Using a Bose gas representation of the process, we link scaling corrections to few-boson scattering amplitudes, which capture memory effects of past reactions. Importantly, the leading corrections are not just given by a small renormalization of the k-particle reaction rate but by memory effects that involve a larger number of particles. This gives rise to two distinct regimes -- a perturbative one and a non-perturbative one -- with different scaling exponents for the corrections. The main results of this

work are summarized in Fig. 1. For the specific case of absorptive reaction-diffusion
processes, further work to compute correlation functions [18] or applications to fusion processes kA  lA with l < k [16] and reactions involving multiple reactant species [26, 57­59] appear straightforward. It is worth pointing out that in evaluating higher-order corrections, we apply techniques that are well-known to describe fewparticle scattering in ultracold quantum gases and nuclear physics, but that are perhaps not widely used in other fields. While this paper provides an application to a particular class of reaction-diffusion systems, it would be interesting to apply these methods more broadly.

[46] Note, however, that ultracold Bose quantum gases are metastable and decay through three-body recombination [36, 60­62], which is described by a reaction-diffusion process with k = 3. Indeed, experimentally the threebody decay is accurately captured to leading order by the mean-field expression (2) with k = 3 [63­67], where the rate  can acquire a microscopic dependence on the density, which may change the scaling exponents. A special case is the so-called unitary limit with   n-4/3, which
