## Abstract

In this theoretical work, the DSP-perceived channel in optical coherent communications is first simplified, based on which we categorize linear MIMO equalizers into four classes according to their reference locations. The entire channel inverse can be represented by a complex conjugate-dependent system, coinciding with the widely linear equalization theory. Suboptimally removing FO dynamics, relatively static channel inverses parameterized with common device and channel parameters are presented for monitoring or calibration purposes.
