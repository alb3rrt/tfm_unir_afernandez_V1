## Abstract

We propose a notion of \emph{natural} binarizations and binary extended formulations, encompassing all the ones studied in the literature. We give a simple characterization of the vertices of such formulations, which allows us to study their behavior with respect to sequential convexification. %0/1 disjunctions. In particular, given a binary extended formulation and % a binarization $B$ of one of its variables $x$, we study a parameter that measures the progress made towards ensuring the integrality of $x$ via application of sequential convexification. We formulate this parameter, which we call rank, as the solution of a set covering problem and express it exactly for the classical binarizations from the literature.
