Abstract. We study the inverse random source problem for the time-space fractional diffusion equation driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index H  (0, 1). With the aid of a novel estimate, by using the operator approach we propose regularity analyses for the direct problem. Then we provide a reconstruction scheme for the source terms f and g up to the sign. Next, combining the properties of Mittag-Leffler function, the complete uniqueness and instability analyses are provided. It's worth mentioning that all the analyses are unified for H  (0, 1).

Keywords: Stochastic fractional diffusion equation, inverse random source problem, Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, reconstruction algorithm

1. Introduction

We consider the stochastic time-space fractional diffusion equation with a random source

term

tu(x, t) + t1-Asu(x, t) = f (x)h(t) + g(x)W H(t) 
u(x, 0) = 0 x  D,

(x, t)  D × (0, T ], (1)

u(x, t) = 0 (x, t)  D × (0, T ],

where D is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary; As with s  (0, 1) is the fractional Laplacian defined by


Asu = sk(u, k)k,
k=1
in which {k, k} k=1 are the nondecreasing eigenvalues and L2-norm normalized eigenfunctions of A = (-) with a zero Dirichlet boundary condition; f (x), g(x)  L2(D) are deterministic terms with g(x) L2(D) = 0; h  L([0, T ]) and there exists

W H(t) with Hurst index H  (0, 1) is the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) on a

complete probability space (, F, P), in which  is a sample space, F is a -algebra on

, and P is a probability measure on the measurable space (, F). It is well known that the fractional diffusion equation works well in describing the
anomalous diffusion phenomena [2, 3, 4]. While the system (1) without source terms governs the probability density function of the subordinate killed Brownian motion [5]. More often, the practical physical system has deterministic and/or stochastic sources.

The source terms for the system (1) are the deterministic one and the fractional Gaussian

noise. In fact, considering the non-ignorable random disturbance, the stochastic fractional partial differential equations have already been widely concerned by scholars mathematically and numerically [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
The inverse source problem is an important topic for anomalous dynamics, involving the inverse source problem in time, space, and time-space fractional diffusion equations

and so on [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. As for the inverse random source

problems of the fractional diffusion equations, the corresponding discussions seem to be few [21, 22, 23]. In [23], by the properties and the It^o isometry of Brownian motions, the authors propose the regularity of the fractional diffusion equations driven by Brownian motions and discuss the reconstruction of source terms and its instability. In [21], the authors consider the inverse random source problem of fractional diffusion equation with

fBms, to be specific, by transforming the Wiener integral with respect to fBm into the

one of Brownian motion, the authors provide the well-posedness of the direct problem

separately.

In this paper, we first provide a unified discussion on the regularity of direct problem

for all H  (0, 1). Then we propose a reconstruction scheme for f and |g| and discuss

the uniqueness. By extending the estimates of the stochastic integral with respect to

fBms with H  (0, 1) in [24], a unified instability analysis for H  (0, 1) is proposed.
Different from the instability discussions in [21], we not only show the instability of recovering gk2, but also for gkgl.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide some facts on fBms and Mittag-Leffler functions. The well-posedness of the direct problem is discussed

in Section 3. Then, we propose the reconstructions of f and |g| and the uniqueness

and instability of the reconstructions are established. In Section 4, we perform some numerical experiments to validate the theoretical results. At last, we conclude the paper with some discussions.

2. Preliminaries

In this section, we provide some useful lemmas and present the solution of Eq. (1). In the following, denote E as the expectation and Cov(X, Y ) = E[(X - E(X))(Y - E(Y ))] for variables X and Y ,  > 0 is arbitrarily small, and C is a positive constant, whose value may differ at different places.
Let us first recall the definitions of Riemann-Liouville fractional integrals.

Definition 2.1 ([1]) The left- and right-sided Riemann-Liouville fractional integrals of

order  ( > 0) are defined by

with a, b  R.

And they have the following properties.

Proof. For supp u, supp v  (a, b), simple calculations give

Combining (2), we get the first desired result and the second one follows by similar

Then, we provide some lemmas about one-dimensional fBm.

one can get the first desired results. As for the second one, it can be obtained similarly.

Next, we give the expression of mild solution. To get the mild solution of Eq. (1), we introduce the Mittag-Leffler function [32],

E,(z) =



zk (k + )

k=0

for z  C. According to [32], the Laplace transform of t-1E,(±t) with ,  > 0 can be written as

 0

e-ztt-1 E, (±t )dt

=

z- z  

.

For the Mittag-Leffler function, we have the following lemma.

(-1)n

Introduce

which can also be written as


E(t)u = E,1(-skt)(u, k)k.

3. The direct problem

In this section, we consider the well-posedness of Eq. (1). Different from the discussions in [21, 23], we develop the regularity theory by operator approach (one can refer to [33]) and Lemma 2.4, which help us give a unified proof for all H  (0, 1) and simplify the proof significantly.

Lemma 3.1 Let u be the solution of Eq. (1), f (x), g(x)  L2(D), and h(t)  L([0, T ]). Then we have

Now, we first provide the reconstructions of f and |g|, and then show the uniqueness and instability of the reconstructions.

Combining Eqs. (7), (8), and Lemmas 4.1, 4.2, one can get the uniqueness of the inverse problem.

Theorem 4.1 Let f (x), g(x)  L2(D), and g(x) L2(D) = 0. Then one can determine the source terms f and |g| uniquely by the data set

{(Euk(T ), Cov(uk(T ), ul(T ))) : k, l  N}.

Proof. According to (7), fk can be got by

fk =

.

4.2. Instability

In this subsection, we show the instability of the inverse source problem. Different from the discussions in [21], we show the instability of recovering gkgl.

Theorem 4.2 Let f (x), g(x)  L2(D) and g(x) L2(D) = 0. Then the following estimates hold

5. Numerical experiments

In this section, we provide some examples to validate the developed theory. Here, we choose D = (0, 1). Thus the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of - are
 k = k22, k(x) = 2 sin(kx), k = 1, 2, · · · .

5.1. Numerical scheme for direct problem
To get synthetic data for inverse problem, we propose a numerical scheme to solve direct problem numerically.
Introduce HN = span{1, 2, . . . , N } with N  N and define the projection operator PN : L2()  HN by
N
PN u = (u, i)i u  L2().
i=1
Define AsN : HN  HN as
N
AsN vN = sk(vN , k)k vN  HN .
k=1

Let  = T /L with L  N and tk = k (k = 0, 1, 2, · · · , L). Then the numerical solution of u(x, tn), i.e., unN , can be approximated by

Further introduce v1,k(t) and v2,k(t) as

v1,k(t) = v2,k(t) =

t
E,1(-sk(t - r))h(r)dr,

t
E,1(-sk(t - r))dW H (r).

It is easy to verify that v1,k(t) and v2,k(t) are the solutions of

tv1,k(t) + t1-skv1,k(t) = h(t)

t  (0, T ],

v1,k(0) = 0

and

tv2,k(t) + t1-skv2,k(t) = W H (t)

t  (0, T ],

v2,k(0) = 0.

The v1,k(tn) and v2,k(tn) can be respectively approximated by v1n,k and v2n,k, which are the solutions of

5.2. Numerical results
In the numerical experiments, we take T = 0.5, N = 20, and L = 1024. As for f (x), g(x), and h(t), we choose
h(t) = t + 1, f (x) = 4x(1 - x)(1 - 2x), g(x) = x(1 - x)2.
We generate 1000 trajectories to approximate the E(uk) and Cov(uk, ul), which can help us to recover f and |g|.
Here, we take (, s, H) as { = 0.4, s = 0.3, H = 0.2}, { = 0.6, s = 0.7, H = 0.2}, { = 0.6, s = 0.3, H = 0.5}, { = 0.4, s = 0.7, H = 0.5}, { = 0.3, s = 0.4, H = 0.8}, and { = 0.7, s = 0.6, H = 0.8}, respectively. The corresponding results are shown in Figures 1­6. From these results, it can be seen that both f and |g| can be well recovered.

6. Conclusion
We study the inverse random source problem for the time-space fractional diffusion equation driven by fBm with Hurst index H  (0, 1). We first provide the well-posedness of the direct problem; and then show the uniqueness of the inverse problem. With the help of Lemma 2.4, we give the instability of recovering f and |g|. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical predictions.
