## Abstract

The existence and stability of collisional kinetic equation, especially non-cutoff Boltzmann equation, in bounded domain with physical boundary condition is longstanding open problem. This work proves the global stability of the Landau equation and non-cutoff Boltzmann equation in union of cubes with the specular reflection boundary condition when an initial datum is near Maxwellian. Moreover, the solution enjoys exponential large-time decay in bounded domain. Our method is based on that fact that normal derivatives in cubes is also derivatives along axis, which allows us to obtain high-order derivative estimates.
