## Abstract

We start by studying a basic two-requests system where one request is private and the other is non-private. We propose a scheme for any correlation structure between two requests, which concatenates an obfuscation scheme and a standard PIR scheme to prevent leakage when retrieving information for the non-private request. The general problem beyond two-requests would require a specification of the correlation structure. Motivated by the location privacy application, we study the Markov model as the correlation structure. To be concrete, we study the problem in the context of location privacy and we apply the basic two-requests intermittent private information retrieval scheme as a building block to design a location privacy protection mechanism that preserves privacy for locations in the trace level.
