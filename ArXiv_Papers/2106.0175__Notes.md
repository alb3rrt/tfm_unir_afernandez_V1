## Abstract

This work presents an analysis of the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method for One Day International (ODI) cricket matches. The accuracy of the DLS method is compared against various supervised learning algorithms for result prediction. The result of a cricket match is predicted during the second inning. The paper also optimized DLS resource table which is used in the Duckworth-Lewis (D/L) formula to increase its predictive power. Finally, an Unpredictability Index is developed that ranks different cricket playing nations according to how unpredictable they are while playing an ODI match.
