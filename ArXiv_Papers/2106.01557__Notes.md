## Abstract

We develop a mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann model for liquid-vapor phase transition by handling the microscopic molecular interaction. The short-range molecular interaction is incorporated by recovering an equation of state for dense gases, and the long-range molecular interaction is mimicked by introducing a pairwise interaction force. Double distribution functions are employed, with the density distribution function for the mass and momentum conservation laws and an innovative total kinetic energy distribution function for the energy conservation law. The recovered mesomacroscopic governing equations are fully consistent with kinetic theory, and thermodynamic consistency is naturally satisfied.
