Abstract. We study the propagation of wavepackets along weakly curved interfaces between topologically distinct media. Our Hamiltonian is an adiabatic modulation of Dirac operators omnipresent in the topological insulators literature. Using explicit formulas for straight edges, we construct a family of solutions that propagates, for long times, unidirectionally and dispersion-free along the curved edge. We illustrate our results through various numerical simulations.

1. Introduction

Topological insulators are fascinating materials that are insulating in their bulk but support robust currents along their boundary. From a mathematical point of view, these properties are consequences of the bulk-edge correspondence, an index-like theorem that relates the net conductivity (an analytic index) to the bulk topology (a topological index). For straight interfaces, the currents are explicitly described in terms of edge states: steady waves with ballistic dynamics, confined between regions of distinct topology.
In this work, we construct dynamical analogues of edge states for curved interfaces. Our model is a Dirac operator

H=

(x) Dx1 + iDx2

Dx1 - iDx2 -(x)

(1.1)

where Dxj = -ixj ,  > 0 is a small semiclassical parameter and  is a varying mass term. Such Hamiltonians emerge in the effective theory of honeycomb structures [FLTW16, LTWZ19, Dro19b]; more generally they model the generic dynamics of modes propagating along interfaces between topologically distinct insulators [Dro21b].

Under a transversality condition ­ (x) = 0 when (x) = 0 ­ the set

 = {x  R2 : (x) = 0}

partitions R2 in regions of distinct local topology ­ see §1.5 for details. A local interpretation of the bulk-edge correspondence suggests that non-trivial currents emerge along . This

paper develops the underlying quantitative theory: it provides detailed information on the associated quantum states, such as their speed and profile.
Specifically, we exploit the explicit structure of edge states available when (x) = a1x1 + a2x2 to construct an infinite-dimensional family of nearly steady solutions to (Dt+H) = 0, in the limit   0. These emerge as the natural channels of conductivity: for long times, they propagate unidirectionally and coherently along . We show that the curvature of  plays a key role in limiting the lifetime of these solutions. We illustrate our results via various numerical simulations.

1.1. Simplified main result. Throughout the paper, we assume that  and all its derivatives are bounded:   Cb(R2). In this introduction, we require moreover that

y    (y) = 1.

(1.2)

This allows us to state a simplified version (Theorem 1) of our main result (Theorem 2). In §3, we replace (1.2) by the more general transversality condition (3.1).
Fix y0   = -1(0) and define yt by the ODE
yt = (yt),
where (y) denotes the /2-counterclockwise rotation of (y). Under (1.2), yt is a unit speed parametrization of . We let t be the angle between the tangent to  at yt and the x-axis ­ see Figure 2. We use the notation t = (1 + |t|2)1/2.

Theorem 1. Let   Cb(R2) satisfy (1.2) and yt, t as above. The solution to

The initial data (1.3) is a Gaussian concentrated at y0. Theorem 1 shows that the generated solution remains (at leading order, for times t -1/2) a Gaussian, concentrated now at yt. This identifies t  yt as an exotic quantum trajectory: it is not predicted by the standard results on propagation of semiclassical singularities. See §1.5 for a semiclassical discussion.

If  is not asymptotically straight ­ for instance if it is a loop ­ numerical computations confirm that the Gaussian state approximation becomes less and less accurate, see Figure 3. In contrast, if  is asymptotically straight ­ as in e.g. the tanh-like interface of Figure 1 ­ the Gaussian state approximation can work for longer times, see Theorem 4.
We refer to Theorem 2 for a more general version of Theorem 1. It constructs an infinite dimensional family of solutions to (Dt + H)t = 0 with the same qualitative features as (1.4): coherent states propagating unidirectionally, at unit speed and without dispersion, along . Our motivation, explained in §1.4 and §1.5 below, is two-fold:
· Identify dynamical analogues of topological edge states along bent interfaces; · Study a semiclassical system whose matrix-valued symbol has repeated eigenvalues.

1.2. Numerical simulations. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations of the Dirac equation with a Gaussian initial data, for various types of interfaces. The corresponding pictures are snapshots of the dynamics, with the interface marked as a light blue curve.
· Figure 1 and 3 are numerical confirmations of Theorem 1 for tanh-type and circle interfaces, respectively. Figure 3 also verifies that the phase shift after one revolution equals 2/2 = .

Figure 3. Left: numerical solution to (Dt +H)t = 0 with Gaussian initial state for a circular interface with  = 10-2 and radius one. The trajectory yt undergoes curvature effects for all times. This explains a dispersion stronger
than for a tanh-type interface. See also Figure 7 and Theorem 4. Right:

After a full revolution, the numerical phase difference is about -, matching the theoretical prediction -2/2 = -. This phase shift interprets as a Berry phase arising from adiabatically varying the parameter  in the effective leading
order operator H,r (2.1) from 0 to 2.

· Figure 4 shows the evolution of other Gaussian states for tanh-type interfaces. The initial data are concentrated like (1.3) but carried by a different vector. If this vector is orthogonal to that in (1.3), the coherence is immediately lost. See Conjecture 1.
· When the more general transversality condition (3.1) holds instead of (1.2), the propagation is coherent in a relaxed sense. Figure 6 ­ a straight interface but a non-linear domain wall ­ numerically validates Theorem 2.
· Figure 7 illustrates the limits of the dynamical analogues of edge states: for instance, they do not propagate around sharp corners.
We use a Crank-Nicholson scheme to approximate the unitary group e-itH, with Fourier spectral spatial discretization. The Matlab code containing the parameters used to obtain our figures can be found on GitHub.1

1.3. Physical motivations. The Dirac equation appears in a wide variety of physical applications. Beyond its original role in the description of relativistic particles, it has emerged as a dominant model in the analysis of topological phases of matter [Vol89, Wit16]. The relativistic Dirac operator ( = 0 in our model) displays a generic band crossing; in contrast, adding a mass term opens an energy gap. In our model, the interface is the transition between the two insulating phases  < 0 and  > 0. These two phases happen to have different topological signatures; this generates unidirectional propagation along the interface.
This asymmetric transport is at the core of most physical applications in the fields of topological insulators and topological superconductors [Ber13, Vol89]. It is the physical manifestation of the quantum Hall effect [BvESB94, ASS90] and its non-magnetic analogues [C+13, Hal88, JS20, HIA19, LD20, S+18]. It also finds numerous applications in fields such as photonics, acoustics, and fluid mechanics [LJS14, PBSM15, RH08, R+13, GJT21]. Broadly speaking, Dirac-type equations often offer the simplest continuum (macroscopic) description of transport in a narrow energy band near the band crossing [Ber13, FC13, Vol89].

1.4. Local topological indices and asymmetric transport. Strikingly, transport at interfaces between distinct topological environments is both asymmetric (a net overall flux propagates in a prescribed direction) and quantized. We discuss here a theory of topological phases that interprets locally the state (1.4) in a topological way. We stress that this interpretation:

· is valid only in the semiclassical regime  1; · is local: our construction works for all , even though in some scenarios H is topo-
logically trivial (for instance when  is a closed curve).

These considerations use the leading-order approximation Hy of H at a point y  R2:

Hy =

(y) Dx1 + iDx2

Dx1 - iDx2 -(y)

,

y / ;

Hy =

-vy · (x - y) Dx1 + iDx2

Dx1 - iDx2 vy · (x - y)

,

y  ,

where vy = (y) is tangent to  at y. These emerge by replacing (x) in (1.1) by its leading-order development at y: (x) (y) if y /  and (x) (y) · (x - y) if y  . These approximations are reasonable for |x - y| = O(1/2): the scale of localization of (1.4).

EDGE STATE DYNAMICS ALONG CURVED INTERFACES

We observe that Hy has a spectral gap near energy 0 (i.e. it is an insulator) if and only if y / . This identifies  as the natural channel for conduction of energy. Following [EG02, KRS02], we measure the local conductivity at y   via:

I(H, y) = TrL2 i Hy, f (vy · x) g Hy , y  ,

(1.5)

where f and g are smooth real functions increasing from 0 to 1 with f and g compactly supported. Formally,

I(H, y)

=

d dt

TrL2

eitHy f (vy · x)g

Hy e-itHy

.

(1.6)

Looking at g as a density of probability, f (vy · x)g Hy measures the probability of a quantum particle to lie in the half-plane {vy · x > 0}, per unit energy. Taking the trace in (1.6) corresponds to summing over all states. Hence I(H, y) describes the overall flux moving in the direction of vy, per unit time and energy, at equilibrium.
It turns out that 2 · I(H, y) = 1, see [Bal19a] and Remark 1 below. This means that the evolution according to Hy comes with a current propagating in the direction of vy. Since vy is tangent to  at y,  emerges intuitively as a natural charge-carrier for H. Theorem 1 confirms these heuristics: in the regime   0, we construct a current propagating along , with explicit speed and profile.

The quantity (1.5) relates to bulk topological invariants via a universal principle: the bulkedge correspondence [Hat93, GP13, PSB16, Bal20, Dro21a]. Following the physics literature [Hal88, HIA19], we define a bulk index for Hy:

sgn (y)

B(H, y) =

, y / .

2

(1.7)

When H emerges as an effective Hamiltonian (for instance in graphene), B(H, y) corresponds

to the integrated Berry curvature near one of the Dirac point momentum, hence as part of

the overall Chern integer [Dro19a]. Direct interpretations of (1.7) as a Chern number include

regularization of Dirac operator [Bal19a] and more general bulk-difference invariant [Bal20].

We refer to (1.7) as the local bulk index. It can also be defined by spatially truncating

physical space formulas for the global Chern number [Kit06,BR11,PSB16]; or via the spectral

localizer [Lor15, LSB20].

Since  points from negative to positive-index regions, we have for y   and  > 0

sufficiently small:

1 = 2 · I(H, y) = B H, y + (y) - B H, y - (y) .

This is a local version of the bulk-edge correspondence: the local conductivity at y is the difference between the local bulk indices across the interface.
The quantity 2 · I(H, y) counts currents algebraically according to their direction of propagation. It is independent of y and stable against large perturbations of H; see, e.g. [Bal19a, Bal20] and [PSB16] for similar models. This explains its practical significance: even in the presence of strong perturbations or Anderson localization, there is always 2·I(H, y) = 1 more current propagating in the direction of vy rather than -vy [Bal19b, PSB16]. This clarifies the local topological nature of the quantum state (1.4). Let us stress again that our results hold locally in time: (1.5) is spectral in nature, describing an equilibrium, while (1.4) is relevant for (long, but only transient) times t -1/2.

1.5. Connection with semiclassical analysis. What makes the solution (1.4) special? The answer lies in semiclassical territory. In summary (with details provided below): if C =  × {0}  R2 × R2, then for times t -1/2:

(i) States initially microlocalized at (y0, 0) / C come in pairs propagating in opposite directions;
(ii) States initially microlocalized at (y0, 0)  C (i.e. like (1.3), with a potentially different 2-vector) seem to either propagate non-dispersively in the direction of , or
to disperse; see Figure 4 and Conjecture 1.

This suggests that  ­ more precisely, its phase-space lift C ­ is the relevant channel for asymmetric propagation.
We now provide a detailed account. We start by writing H = h(x, Dx), where

h(x, ) =

(x) 1 + i2

1 - i2 -(x)

.

Theorem 1 constructs solutions to Dt + h(x, Dx) t = 0 for the data

where (x0, 0) belongs to the set C defined by C = (x, ) : (x) = 0,  = 0  R4.

The function 0 is known in the literature as a semiclassical wavepacket [CR12] with wavefront set W F(0) = {(x0, 0)} ­ see [Zwo12, §8.4] for definitions and properties of wavefronts. The set C corresponds to semiclassical eigenvalue crossings of h(x, ): when (x, )  C, h(x, ) has two degenerate eigenvalues. The systematic study of such semiclassical systems is a del-
icate problem. In the context of the Landau­Zener effect, which corresponds to a varying
crossing energy, we refer to [CdV04] for a derivation of local normal forms, and to [Hag94]
for an explicit description of the transition.
This paper focuses on the dynamics of wavepackets localized along C (note that the crossing energy is constant, equal to 0). One could have likewise studied the dynamics of wavepackets semiclassically concentrated at points (x0, 0) / C. This is actually a much more standard problem because the eigenvalues of h(x0, 0) are distinct: they are ±(x0, 0), where

(x, ) = (x)2 + 12 + 22;

we note that  does not vanish away from C. We diagonalize h(x, ) for (x, ) near (x0, 0):

h(x, ) = U(x, )

-(x, ) 0

0 (x, )

U(x, )-1,

where U is a unitary 2 × 2 matrix that depends smoothly on (x, ). Thus, after quantization, the system Dt +h(x, Dx)  = 0 splits semiclassically near (x0, 0) in two nearly decoupled equations [Teu03, MS09]:

Dt +

-(x, Dx) 0

0 (x, Dx)

According to the classical-to-quantum correspondence, the wavefront set of t follows the semiclassical trajectories of ±(x, ) ­ see e.g. [Zwo12, Theorem 12.5]. These form two branches x+t , t+ and x-t , t- , that solve respectively

(1.8)

The Hamiltonian trajectories (1.8) never reach C because (a) the energy ±(x0, 0) = 0 is conserved along them; and (b) C is the zero set of the function . Hence, if (x0, 0) / C then the semiclassical singularities of t globally evolve according to the classical-to-quantum correspondence: they follow the Hamiltonian trajectories (1.8) and never reach C.
Moreover, the two branches in (1.8) point (at t = 0) in opposite directions: wavepackets concentrated away from C have no preferred direction of propagation. Their contribution to an overall quantum flux cancel out. Hence, C is the only phase-space channel that can support unidirectional waves.
This discussion connects various characterizations of the set C:

(i) Semiclassical: C is the set of eigenvalue crossings of h(x, ); (ii) Energetic: C is the characteristic set of h(x, ), i.e. the set of points (x, ) such that
det h(x, ) = 0. (iii) Topological: the local Chern number is not defined on  = -1(0) = (C) (with
(x, ) = x) because the eigenvalues of h(x, ) are degenerate on C. (iv) Dynamical: Among phase-space subsets, C is the only (maximal) candidate that may
support unidirectional wavepackets.

Because of (i), the classical-to-quantum correspondence fails. Because of conservation of energy, (ii) suggests that a state semiclassically concentrated along C should remain this way: C acts as a semiclassical waveguide. Theorem 1 provides the corresponding profile and speed. Under global assumptions on , the bulk-edge correspondence predicts a nonvanishing quantum flux between regions of different topology. From (iii), C acts as the natural topological interface in phase-space. According to (iv), it is also the only channel
that can support waves contributing to a non-trivial conductivity.

A legitimate criticism to Theorem 1 is that it does not study the dynamics of all initial data localized along C: it focuses on those parallel to the two-vector [e-i0, -ei0] . As
demonstrated numerically in Figure 4 the data prepared along the orthogonal two-vector [-ei0, e-i0] appear to purely disperse along the interface. An investigation of the linear case suggests that the rate of dispersion is -1/4t-1/2.

Thus, we conjecture that general initial data semiclassically localized along C transit to the state (1.4). To write a precise statement, we split vectors [1, 2]  C2 according to:

1 2

e-i0/2 -ei0/2

We interpret the two terms in (1.9) as projections on the vector from (1.3) and its orthogonal.

The L-remainder in (1.11) is smaller than the leading order term as long as -t-1/2 -1/2, that is 1-2 t. Hence, according to this conjecture, t is well approximated by the Gaussian term in (1.11) for times 1-2 t -1/2 (with  < 3/4 ensuring that such times
exist). This indicates that dynamical edge states generically emerge from the evolution of initial data localized along C. See §3.3 for a more general version of Conjecture 1.

1.6. Organization of the paper. We organize the paper as follows:
· In §2 we review edge state theory for Dirac operators with straight domain walls, i.e. (x) = a · x in (1.1).
· In §3 we derive the analogues of edge states for weakly curved interface. Specifically, we construct a infinite-dimensional family of solutions to (Dt + H)t = 0 that propagates along the topological interface  for times up to -1/2. The key ingredient is a local approximation of H by Dirac operators with straight interfaces.
· In §4 we investigate, under a geometric condition of , how the curvature of  affects the propagation of wavepackets.

2. Edge states and dynamics for straight interfaces

We review here the simplest example of domain wall : we write

(x) = ,r(x) = -r sin()x1 + r cos()x2 = r

- sin() cos()

·x

with   R, r > 0. The interface -,r1(0) = Rv is a straight line, directed by the vector v = -[cos(), sin()] ­ see Figure 5. The Hamiltonian is then

H,r =

,r (x) Dx1 + iDx2

Dx1 - iDx2 -,r(x)

.

(2.1)

It admits edge states: solutions to (H,r - )F,r= 0 that are localized and harmonic along Rv. Here we review their explicit expression and their dynamical properties.

2.1. Conjugation properties. We first show that the Hamiltonians H,r and H0,r are conjugated by a change of frame and gauge. For this purpose, we introduce the operator

Uf (x) = Uf (Rx),

R =

cos() - sin()

sin() cos()

;

U =

e-i/2 0

0 ei/2

.

(2.2)

Lemma 2.1. The Hamiltonian (2.1) is unitarily equivalent to the Hamiltonian H0,r with U-1H,r U = H0,r.

Proof. Let R be the pullback operator by R: Rf (x) = f (Rx). We note that ,r(x) = r · R e2 · x = r(Rx)2. Thus R- 1,rR = rx2. We now use R- 1DxR = R Dx to compute partial derivatives involved in H,r:

R- 1(Dx1 + iDx2 )R =

1 i

· R Dx = R

1 i

· Dx =

ei iei

· Dx = ei(Dx1 + iDx2).

The adjoint identity is R- 1(Dx1 - iDx2 )R = e-i(Dx1 - iDx2 ).
Grouping these identities, we obtain:

R- 1H,rR =

rx2 ei(Dx1 + iDx2 )

e-i(Dx1 - iDx2 ) -rx2

= s1Dx1 + s2Dx2 + s3rx2,

where, s1, s2, s3 are 2 × 2 Hermitian matrices given by

s1 =

0 ei

e-i 0

,

s2 =

0 iei

-ie-i 0

,

s3 =

= 3.

An explicit calculation shows that U-1sjU = j. We conclude that U-1H,rU = 1Dx1 + 2Dx2 + 3x2 = H0,r.
This completes the proof.

(2.3)

Remark 1. The relation (2.2) allows us to calculate the conductivity of H,r in the direction
of v, see (1.5): it is equal to 1. Indeed, the conductivity of H0,r (counted positively in the direction of e2 = -e1) is equal to 1 [Bal19a]. Therefore, using invariance of the trace under conjugation, and the fact that f is a scalar function:

1 = TrL2 H0,r, f (-x1) g (H0,r)

= TrL2 H,r, Rf (-x · e1)R- 1 g (H,r) = TrL2 [H,r, f (v · x)]g (H,r) .

The Hamiltonian H0,r admits edge states: for any   R, if

then F0,r(, ·) is a plane wave in x1, i.e. along the interface; decays transversely along the interface, i.e., in x2; and satisfies the stationary Dirac equation (H0,r - )F0,r(, ·) = 0. From
Lemma 2.1 we deduce that H,r also admits edge states:

2.2. Dynamics of edge states. We review here how edge states give rise to an infinitedimensional family of ballistic waves for Dirac operators with linear domain walls.

The functions (2.5) are the ballistic waves generated by edge states: they propagate along the interface Rv and decay rapidly along Rv. Our scaling casts (2.5) as wavepackets:

3. Dynamical analogues of edge states along curved interfaces

We now consider non-linear domain walls, opening the possibility for curved topological interfaces. We relax (1.2) to a global transversality condition:

inf (y) : (y) = 0} > 0.

(3.1)

We recall that all derivatives of  are uniformly bounded:   Cb(R2). We plan to produce a dynamical analogue of edge states: a solution to

(Dt + H) = 0,

H=

(x) Dx1 + iDx2

Dx1 - iDx2 -(x)

,

that propagates for long time along the topological interface  = -1(0).

The equation (2.6) motivates the ansatz

(t, x) = -1/2a t, x- yt , where: 

· a  S(R2, C2) has a full expansion in powers of 1/2; · y0   and yt   is the solution of the ODE

yt = v(yt),

(y) v(y) = |(y)| ,

w =

0 1

-1 0

w.

The vector v(y) is the local analogue to v: at each point y  , it is the unit tangent vector to  obtained by rotating counterclockwise (y). Since (y0) = 0, yt   for any t:

d(yt) dt

=

yt

·

(yt)

=

v(yt)

·

(yt)

=

0.

Let t and rt be such that

(yt) = rt

- sin(t) cos(t)

,

so that

v(yt) = -

cos(t) sin(t)

,

see Figure 2. With these notations in place, we define Kt : S(R)  S(R2, C2) by:

Ktf (x) = rt1/4f

f  S(R).

(3.3)

Then uniformly for   (0, 1] and t > 0:

(3.4)

Theorem 2 constructs a solution to (Dt + H)t = 0, propagating dispersion-free along yt, for times t -1/2. Under geometric conditions on , we can extend this time of validity;
see Theorem 4. These two results focus on maximizing the lifespan of approximate solutions. We can instead focus on improving their accuracy: see Theorem 3 for solutions up to O(n)
for every n, but fixed lifetime.

EDGE STATE DYNAMICS ALONG CURVED INTERFACES

Figure 6. A straight interface but a non-linear domain wall: (x) = (1-0.9 sin(x1))x2. We have yt = -te1 hence rt = 1 + 0.9 sin(t). This quantity
nearly degenerates for t near -/2 + Z, inducing lateral spreading of the wavepacket for
such times, but reconstruction
in between.

When rt is not constant ­ corresponding to (3.1) holding instead of (1.2) ­ the state in (3.4) is coherent in a relaxed sense: there may be lateral spreading at scale rt (which remains bounded above and below by our assumptions on ). See the expression (3.2) for Ktf and Figure 6 for a numerical illustration.
The initial data (3.3) is quite specific: the rescaled amplitude K0f is in the range of K0. To obtain a full picture of evolution of states initially microlocalized along C, we need to understand how orthogonal initial data propagate:

0(x)

=

1 

·

K0f

x - y0


.



This suggests a refinement of Conjecture 1. Let  : S(R2, C2)  S(R2, C2) be the orthogonal
projection on the range of K0. We observe that K0 is an isomorphism to its range; therefore, for any a  S(R2, C2), there exists a unique f  S(R) such that a = K0f .

Conjecture 2. There exists  < 3/4 with the following. Let a  S(R2, C2), f  S(R) such that a = K0f , and t be the solution to (Dt + H)t = 0 with initial data

0(x)

=

1 

·

a

x - y0 

.

Then uniformly in   (0, 1], t > 0:

t(x)

=

1 

·

Ktf

x- yt 

+ OL2 1/2t + OL -t-1/2 .

According to Conjecture 2, any function localized (in a semiclassical sense) near (y0, 0) splits in propagating and dispersive parts, with the analogue of an edge state emerging dynamically. See Figure 4 for a numerical confirmation.

3.1. Structure of proof of Theorem 2. We will prove Theorem 2 by establishing the following statements.

(1) Approximate solutions of the Dirac equation solve a hierarchy of transport equations,

In the second line we used the first sum starts at j, k = 1, since j + k  m + 1 and j, k  m.

We note that T1 is the sum of Dt and a polynomial of degree 2. For j  2, Tj is a polynomial of degree j + 1; and Rm is bounded by C|x|m+2. All coefficients involved depend
on derivatives of ; in particular their values at yt are uniformly bounded in time. In particular, after extracting Dt, we can bound all multiplicative terms by C x m+2. We

We will show in the following how to construct solutions aj to the hierarchy (3.7), and then bound their derivatives and moments. Together with Lemma 3.1 this will give a rigorous construction of approximate solutions to the Dirac equation.

3.3. Spectral analysis of leading order transport operator. The dominant equation of the hierarchy (3.7) is T0a0 = 0, where T0 is defined in (3.5); the other equations are

j-1
T0aj = - Tj- a ,
=0

1  j  m.

Solving these equations amounts to (i) find ker(T0); and (ii) establish a stability estimate (here, a spectral gap) for T0-1 away from ker(T0). Below we write T0 = Lt,rt, where

L,r =

cos() sin()

Dx +

r,r(x) Dx1 + iDx2

Dx1 - iDx2 -r,r(x)

=

cos() sin()

Dx + Hr,.

(3.11)

We now focus on the analysis of L,r on S(R2, C2). We first compute its kernel (Lemma 3.2) and prove it is one to one on the orthogonal complement (Lemma 3.3).

Lemma 3.2. For every r > 0 and   R, the nullspace of L,r : S(R2, C2)  S(R2, C2) is

kerS(R2)(L,r) =

f

(Rx)1

e-

r(R 2

x)22

e-i/2 -ei/2

, f  S(R)

.

(3.12)

Proof. As in (2.3), U-1L,rU = L0,r, with U = RU. Indeed, U-1R- 1HRU = H0 and

U-1

cos() sin()

· DxU = R e1 · R Dx = Dx1.



Moreover, if Srf (x) = f ( rx), then we have

Sr-1 H0,r Sr

=

 rH0,1.



Hence, H,r and H0,1 are conjugated (up to multiplication by r). The identity (3.11) implies

that the same holds for L,r and L0,1:

Sr-1 U-1 L,r U Sr

=

 rL0,1.

(3.13)

Thus, to find the kernel of L,r, it suffices to find that of L0,1. We have

L0,1 =

Dx1 + x2 Dx1 + iDx2

Dx1 - iDx2 Dx1 - x2

=

1 1

1 1

Dx1 +

x2 iDx2

-iDx2 -x2

.

We claim that

kerS(R2)(L0,1) =

f

(x1)e-

x22 2

1 -1

: f  S(R)

.

(3.14)

The right inclusion follows from a computation. To prove the left inclusion, we pick u such that L0,1u = 0. We take the Fourier transform in x1: this gives L0,1()u = 0, where

L0,1() = 

1 1

1 1

+

x2 iDx2

-iDx2 -x2

.

We fix . The operator L0,1() is a linear differential operator; hence the space of decaying solutions to L0,1()v = 0 is at most one-dimensional. Indeed, if v1, v2 are such functions, then

EDGE STATE DYNAMICS ALONG CURVED INTERFACES

17

their Wronskian is constant; and they decay. Thus their Wronskian vanishes; this implies that v1, v2 are linearly dependent. We then observe that

L0,1

(

)e-

x22 2

1 -1

= 0.

This shows that the kernel of L0,1() is one-dimensional. Superposing over  yields (3.14). Applying the equivalence between L0,1 and L,r, we conclude that the kernel of L,r is precisely made of functions

f  S(R).

 This corresponds to (3.12), where we rescaled f by r (this preserves the Schwartz class).

We define the space

S,r(R2) = u  S(R2, C2) : u  kerS(R2,C2)(L,r) ,
with orthogonality computed with respect to the L2-scalar product. We provide S,r(R2) with the seminorms inherited from S(R2, C2).

Lemma 3.3. For every   R and r > 0, the operator L,r acting on S,r(R2) is one to one, with inverse L-,r1 bounded on S,r(R2).

Proof.

1.

We

recall

that

L,r

and

 rL0,1

are

conjugated

by

operators

on

S(R2, C2),

see (3.13). Thus, it suffices to prove the lemma for L0,1 only.

We introduce the annihilation and creation operators a and a, as well as its associated

quantum harmonic oscillator h = aa and quantum states n:

a = x2 + x2, a = x2 - x2, h = -x22 + x22 - 1,

n(x2)

=

).

The quantum states n form a complete orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of h: for every n,

n L2 = 1 and hn = 2nn. Moreover they satisfy the creation and annihilation relations:

a0 = 0 and for n  N, 
an = 2n + 2n+1,

 an+1 = 2n + 2n.

(3.15)

Introduce

L~0,1 =

and the associated space S~0,1(R2) ­ defined similarly as S0,1(R2):

S~0,1(R2) = u  S(R2) : u  kerS(R2)(L~0,1)

= u  S(R2) : x1  R, u1(x)0(x2)dx2 = 0 .

The lemma boils down to prove that L~0,1 is invertible on S~0,1(R2).

2. Let W be the Fr´echet space of functions w  C(R × N, C2) such that w1(·, 0) = 0, equipped with the seminorms

N,,(w) = sup n 2   w(, n) , , ,   N. n,

R2

u1(x)n+1(x2) u2(x)n(x2)

dx,

u  S~0,1 R2 , n  N,   R.

We first observe that S : S~0,1(R2)  W is continuous. Indeed, if u  S~0,1(R2) and , ,   N, we have

2n 2   DSu(, n) = Sv(, n), v(x) = h 2 Dx1  (-x1)u(x).

Moreover, v  S(R2) when u  S(R2). The Cauchy­Schwarz inequality yields

where we used n L2 = 1. The RHS is controlled by Schwartz semi-norms of v = h 2 x1  Dx1u, thus of u. Hence u  0 and S is continuous.
Moreover, S is invertible. The range of S is W: if w  W then we have Su = w with

1 u(x) =

eix1

R

n=0

n+1(x2)w1(, n) n(x2)w2(, n)

using the Fourier inversion formula and orthogonality relations for the n. We now show that S is one-to-one. If u  S~0,1(R2) is such that Su  0 then

x1  R, n  N,

R

u1(x)n+1(x2) u2(x)n(x2)

dx2 = 0

(3.18)

from the Fourier inversion formula. Since n forms an orthonormal basis of L2(R), (3.18) implies that u2  0 and u1(x) = c(x1)0(x2). From u  S~0,1(R2) and (3.17), u1  0. Hence
S is invertible.

3. Because of the closed graph theorem, invertible continuous operators between Fr´echet

spaces have continuous inverses. Hence the inverse of S is continuous from W to S~0,1(R2).

Hence, to prove the lemma it suffices to show that SL~0,1S-1 : W  W is continuously invert-

ible. But SL~0,1S-1 is actually a simple multiplication operator: using that Dx1 corresponds to  in Fourier space and a, a are shift operators ­ see (3.15) ­ in Hermite space, we have:



SL~0,1S-1w(, n) =

0 2n + 2

2n + 2 2

w(, n).

(3.19)

This is a continuous operator on W; and (3.19) yields a formula for L~-0,11:

This completes the proof.

3.4. Solving the dominant equation. We now focus on solving the hierarchy of equations (3.7), starting with the first two:

T0a0 = 0, T0a1 + T1a0 = 0.
Below we abuse notation: we allow functions in S(R) or S(R2, C2) to also depend smoothly on time, and we consider the operator Kt from (3.2) on functions depending on t. For instance, we write (3.20) as

a0(t, x) = Ktf0(t, x) = rt1/4f0

t, (Rtx)1

e-

rt (Rt 2

x)22

e-it/2 -eit/2

(3.20)

Since T0 = Lt,rt, Lemma 3.2 implies that for any f0  S(R) (potentially depending on t), (3.20) solves the equation T0a0 = 0.

3.5. Solving the subleading equation. The subleading equation in the hierarchy (3.7) is

T0a1 + T1a0 = 0 where T0 = Lt,rt and

T1 = Dt +





(yt) !

x3

.

||=2

(3.21)

Given a0 satisfying (3.20), we regard T0a1 + T1a0 = 0 as an equation with unknown a1  S(R2, C2). According to Lemma 3.3, a solution exists if for any t  R, T1a0(t, ·)  St,rt(R2).
We now look for f0 such that this holds.

We note that T1a0  St,rt(R2) if and only if for every t  R and g  S(R):

t, x1  R,

e-

rt x22 2

Using this identity in (3.29) completes the proof.

From (3.23) and Lemma 3.4, we obtain the transport equation for f0: Dtf0 = 0. Hence, f0 depends on x1 only, and we write f0(t, x1) = f0(x1). Therefore, if

the general solution to T0a1 + T1a0 = 0 by adding an element of ker(Lt,rt): a1 = b1 + Ktf1:

3.6. Proof of Theorem 2. We are now in a position to prove Theorem 2. We start with a classical result based on Duhamel's formula.

Lemma 3.5. Let t  S(R2) be a solution to (Dt + H)t = 0. Then for any vt  S(R2),

vt - t L2 

v0 - 0

1 L2 + 

t 0

(Ds + H)vs L2ds.

Proof. Let wt = vt - t and rt = (Dt + H)vt. Then, (Dt + H)wt = rt. By Duhamel's formula,

vt

We bound both sides in L2, using that e-itH is unitary:

vt - t L2 

v0 - 0

1 L2 + 

t 0

(Ds + H)vs L2ds.

This completes the proof.

Proof of Theorem 2. 1. Let f0  S(R). Let a0 as in (3.20), b1 is as in (3.31) and a(1) = a0 + 1/2a1. We apply Lemma 3.1 with m = 1:

(Dt + H)W [a(1)]yt L2  C3/2 Dtb1 L2 + x 3 a0 L2 + x 3 b1 L2 .

(3.32)

2. We now bound the right-hand-side of (3.32), starting with

a0 = Kt,rtf0, where

K,r = r1/4f

(Rx)1

e-

r(R 2

x)22

e-i/2 -ei/2

x 3 a0 in L2.

We write

We note that we have the identity K,r = Dr U K0,1, where Dr is a partial dilation operator and U was introduced in (2.2):

Drg(x) = r1/4g

 x1, rx2

,

Ug(x) =

e-i/2 0

0 ei/2

g(Rx).

(3.33)

The operator K0,1 is bounded from S(R) to S(R2, C2); U is uniformly bounded from S(R2) to S(R2, C2) for   R; and Dr is bounded uniformly on S(R2) for r in compact subsets of
(0, ). Moreover, rt = (yt) lives in a compact subset of (0, ), because of   Cb(R2) and (3.1). We deduce that a0  S(R2), with uniform-in-time bounds on its seminorms. In particular, x 3 a0 L2 is uniformly bounded.

For later use, we observe that ta0 is also uniformly bounded in S(R2). Indeed, from (3.33), we have

ta0 = rtrDrt Ut K0,1f0 + t Drt Ut K0,1f0.

(3.34)

The operators Ut and rDrt are uniformly bounded on S(R2) ­ the latter because rt lives in a compact subset of (0, ). The quantities rt and t are uniformly bounded:

|rt| =

(yt), 2(yt) 2 (yt)



(yt) · 2(yt)

 C;

and likewise,

t

=

d (yt) dt rt

 1 + |2(yt)|  C.

rt

rt

Therefore, we deduce from (3.34) that ta0 is uniformly bounded in S(R2).

3. We now control in L2 the terms Dtb1 and x 3 b1 that appear in (3.32). We use (3.13)

to write b1 as:

b1(t, ·) = -L-t1,rt a0 = -rtSr-t1U-t 1L-0,11Ut Srt a0.

(3.35)

As in Step 2, all operators involved in (3.35) are uniformly bounded in S(R2), and we deduce
that b1  S(R2) uniformly in time. Also similarly to (3.34), taking time derivatives produces
quantities such as rt, rt-1/2, t (all uniformly bounded); operators such as rDrt, rDrt-1, Ut and U-t, all uniformly bounded on S(R2); and the function ta0 ­ also bounded uniformly in S(R2). We deduce that b1, tb1 are uniformly in S(R2). Hence, x 3 b1 L2 and tb1 L2 are uniformly bounded.

4. Going back to (3.32), we have for any t:

(Dt + H)W [a(1)]yt L2  C3/2.

(3.36)

Let t be the solution to (Dt + H)t = 0 with initial data 0 = a0(0, ·); and vt = W [a(1)]yt. We note that v0 - 0 = 1/2b1(0, ·) and that vt satisfies the bound (3.36). Thanks to Lemma
3.5, we get

Therefore,

vt - t L2  1/2 b1(0, ·) L2 + C1/2t.

t = W [a(1)]yt + OL2 1/2 t = W [a0]yt + OL2 1/2 t .

This completes the proof.

3.7. Subsequent equations. We now focus on deriving a version of Theorem 2 that favors accuracy over lifetime. This requires to solve higher-order transport equations.
The base case is the result of §3.4-3.5, summarized as follows:
(H1) For any f0  S(R), there exists b1 such that for any f1(t, ·)  S(R) if a0 = Ktf0 and a1 = b1 + Ktf1, then a0 and a1 solve (3.7) with m = 1, i.e.
j
Tj- aj = 0, 0  j  1.
=0
To construct a0 and a1, we had to enforce a condition on f0. Likewise, to construct am we will enforce a condition on fm-1.
Our inductive assumption is, for m  1:
(Hm) For any f0  S(R), there exist b1, f1, . . . , bm-1, fm-1, bm  S(R) depending smoothly on t, such that for any fm  S(R), if a0 = Ktf0 and a = b + Ktf then
j
Tj- aj = 0, 0  j  m.
=0

EDGE STATE DYNAMICS ALONG CURVED INTERFACES

23

We proved (H1) in §3.5. We now assume that (Hm-1) holds and we prove (Hm) for m  2. Because of Lemma 3.1, this boils down to constructing am = bm + Ktfm such that:

T0(bm + Ktfm) + T1am-1 + · · · + Tma0 = 0, where:

(3.37)

· The operators Tk are defined in (3.6); · The amplitudes a0, . . . , am-2 are fully specified by (Hm-1); · The amplitude am-1 = bm-1 + Ktfm-1, with bm-1 given by (Hm-1) and fm-1  S(R)
remains be selected.

Since the operator Kt parametrizes the kernel of T0, (3.37) is equivalent to

T0bm = m-1 - T1Ktfm-1, m-1 = -T1bm-1 - T2am-2 - · · · - Tma0.

(3.38)

Note that (Hm-1) fully prescribes m-1.
As in §3.5, to solve (3.38), it suffices that for any t, m-1 - T1Ktfm-1 (t, ·) is in the kernel of T0. This is equivalent to

t, x1  R,

e-

rt x22 2

Thanks to Lemma 3.4, this is equivalent to:

(3.40)

When fm-1 is given by this formula, the equation (3.38) admits a solution bm(t, ·)  S(R2, C2). This completes the proof of (Hm). The following result summarizes our findings:

Theorem 3. Fix T > 0 and n  N. If aj  S(R2) are constructed as above, then (Dt + H)t = 0 has a solution of the form

uniformly for   (0, 1] and t in [0, T ].

According to Theorem 3, after adequately correcting the initial data (3.3) we obtain
approximate solutions concentrated near yt at arbitrary accuracy in . Correcting the initial data is necessary: otherwise the subleading amplitude (which is of order 1/2) likely contains
a dispersive part, hence cannot remain fully concentrated near yt.

Remark 2 (Timescale of validity of error estimates). Including higher order correctors as in

(3.41) does not extend the timescale of validity -1/2 of the approximation solution. Indeed,

By construction, the functions aj are smooth in t and Schwartz in x. In particular, they satisfy uniform Schwartz-class bounds for t in compact intervals. Hence, thanks to Lemma 3.1, we have uniformly in t  [0, T ]:

4. The effect of curvature

It is natural to wonder which quantities affect the lifetime of our quantum state. For instance, when  is linear, the interface is straight and the edge states have infinite lifetime. If  is asymptotically linear, the interface is asymptotically straight and we expect an extended time of validity. In contrast, numerical simulations indicate that circular interfaces come with gradual dispersion: see Figure 3.
This suggests that an integrated curvature limits the lifespan. Curvature however cannot be the only limiting factor: as Figure 6 shows, even straight interfaces can generate dispersion. To isolate the effects of curvature, we consider in this section domain walls  that satisfy a geometric condition:

y  -1(0)  (y) = 1, 2(y) · (y) = 0.

(4.1)

Example of  satisfying (4.1) include:

· (x) =  · x with || = 1, for a straight interface; · (x) = x21 + x22 - 1, for a circle.

The condition (4.1) is not geometrically restrictive: given , we can always find  with
 = -1(0), satisfying (4.1) ­ see §4.2. This condition excludes scenarios such as those giving rise to Figure 6. Under (4.1), t is the curvature of  at yt; and in a suitable frame, the Hessian of  along  depends only on t:

Rtx, 2(yt)Rtx = tx21.

(4.2)

Theorem 4. Under (4.1), the solution (1.4) to (Dt + H)t = 0 of Theorem 1 satisfies, uniformly in t > 0 and   (0, 1]:

EDGE STATE DYNAMICS ALONG CURVED INTERFACES

25

When  is asymptotically straight (i.e. it has L2-curvature), the remainder in (4.3) remains small for t -1: our quantum state is longer-lived. In contrast, if  is a closed loop then t grows linearly and our state is only close to the exact solution for t2 1, that is t -1/2: there is no improvement over Theorem 1. Thus, such states ­ which are not globally topological ­ have a shorter lifetime.
Theorem 4 highlights effective limitations of dynamical edge states: they do not survive in strongly curved environments; see Figure 7. This means that our results rely on  being sufficiently regular. Other limitations include cross-type or knot-type interfaces, for which  degenerates quadratically; see Figure 8. Such scenarios form interesting open problems.

4.1. Proof of Theorem 4. The proof of Theorem 4 relies on the precise calculation of the corrector a1 = b1 + Ktf1 involved in §3.4-3.5.

Lemma 4.1. In the setup of Theorem 4, the subleading amplitude a1 = b1 + Ktf1 satisfies

(4.4)

Proof of Lemma 4.1. The proof relies on the hierarchy of transport equations studied in §3.4. We use the notations introduced there, keeping in mind that rt = 1 here.

We first compute b1. From the initial condition (1.3),

a0(0,

x)

=

e-

x2 2

e-i0/2 -ei0/2

.

Hence f0(x1) = e-x21/2. Moreover b1 is the unique solution in ker(T0) to T0b1 + T1a0 = 0. With qt(x) = x, 2(yt)x , this equation reads

where we used the identities (3.25). To find b1, we use the operators Ut and Rt introduced in (2.2) and we look for b1 of the form

b1 = Rt Ut

We observe a growing amplitude loss as the corner gets sharper.

Figure 8. Left: interface (x) = x1x2; right: an interface consisting of two rings parametrized by |x + e1||x - e1| = 1 both with  = 2 · 10-2. While the direction of propagation can be heuristically predicted using the bulk-edge
correspondence, establishing a rigorous theory remains an open problem.

We take advantage of the relation T0 = Lt,1 = RtUtL0,1U-t1R-t1 (see (3.11) and the beginning of the proof of Lemma 3.2) and apply the operator U-t1R-t1 to the equation (4.5). We deduce that c1 and c2 must solve:

We now use the operator L~0,1 of (3.16) and get:

0 a a 2Dx1

c1 - c2 c1 + c2

=

e-

x2 2

t - qt Rtx

0 1

.

From a(c1 + c2) = 0, we obtain c1 = -c2 because a has trivial kernel. Thus,

b1(t, x) = c1(t, Rtx)Ut

ac1(t, x)

We now use (4.2): qt Rtx = tx21. Hence c1 satisfies the equation

ac1(t, x)

=

x21

e-

x2 2

t.

From the condition b1  ker(T0) we deduce that c1(t, x1, ·)  e-x22/2 for every (t, x1). Therefore, c1 is explicitly given by:

c1(t, x)

This yields the identity (4.4) for b1.

where by (3.38) 1 = -T1b1 - T2a0. In view of (3.6), T2 is carried by 3 and we deduce from (3.25) that

-

eit/2 -e-it/2

· 1(t, x) = 2Dt c1(t, Rtx)

Proof of Theorem 4. We set a(2) = a0 + 1/2a1 + b2, with a0, a1, b2 solutions of T0a0 = 0, T0a1 + T1a0 = 0, T0b2 + T1a1 + T2a0 = 0;

From the explicit expression (3.30) for a0, x 4 a0 L2 is uniformly bounded. From the explicit expression (4.4) for a1, x 4 a1 L2 is bounded by 1 + t. It remains to bound
x 4 b2 L2 and Dtb2 L2. By construction, recalling that rt = 1:

b2(t, ·) = -L-t1,1 T1a1 + T2a0 .

The explicit expressions for a0 and a1 allow us to bound Schwartz-class seminorms of T1a1 + T2a0 by 1 + t (the term tt = (tt)2 is uniformly bounded). Arguing as in (3.35), we deduce that Schwartz-class seminorms of b2(t, ·) and Dtb2(t, ·) are bounded by 1 + t. In particular:
Dtb2 L2 + x 4 b2 L2  C(1 + t).
We deduce that

(Dt + H)W

a(2) yt

We note that at t = 0, t and W a(2) yt coincide up to OL2(1/2). Thus, applying Lemma 3.5, we conclude that

 C1/2 + Ct (1 + t) .

This completes the proof of Theorem 4.

4.2. Geometric setup. We prove here the geometric facts stated above. First, if  is a nodal set, then we can find a function  satisfying (4.1) with -1(0) = .

Lemma 4.2. If  = ~-1(0) for a function ~  Cb(R2) satisfying the transversality condition (3.1), then we can find   Cb(R2) satisfying (4.1) such that  = -1(0).

Proof of Lemma 4.2. Without loss of generalities, we may assume that |~(y)| = 1 along . We aim to construct   Cb(R2) with |~| < 1 such that if



=

~

-

~2 

=

~

1 - ~

2

(4.10)

then  satisfies (4.1). Under the condition || < 1, -1(0) = ~-1(0) = . Moreover,  = ~ (1 - ~) - ~2 ; 2
hence if y   then (y) = ~(y). Also

2 = 2~(1 - ~) - ~~ - ~ - ~~ - ~2 2. 2
So, if y   then 2(y) = 2~(y) - (y)~(y)~(y) . We deduce that for y  ,

(y), 2(y)(y) = ~(y), 2~(y)~(y) - (y) ~(y), ~(y)~(y) ~(y) = ~(y), 2~(y)~(y) - (y).

We now pick ~  C(R2), such that ~(y) = ~(y), 2~(y)~(y) for y  . Then, with

~(y) (y) = 1 + ~(y)2~(y)2

EDGE STATE DYNAMICS ALONG CURVED INTERFACES

29

we still have (y) = ~(y), 2~(y)~(y) for y  ;   Cb(R2); and finally,

|~|

=

|~~| 1 + ~2~2



1 .
2

The function  given by (4.10) now satisfies the requirements of the lemma. Indeed, by construction we have for y  :

(y) = ~(y) = 1, (y), 2(y)(y) = 0.

(4.11)

We can then write ||2 = 1 +  for some smooth function . Taking the gradient on both

sides produces the identity:

22 ·  =  + .

In particular, pairing with  gives

2 , 2 ·  =  ,  .

Specializing at y   produces

(y), 2(y) · (y) = 0,

which together with the second identity of (4.11) yields 2(y)(y) = 0 when y  .

We now prove the useful relation (4.2).

Proof of (4.2). We recall that Rte1 = -yt = -(yt) and Rte2 = -yt = (yt). Therefore, proving (4.2) boils down to showing

yt, 2(yt)yt = t, yt, 2(yt)yt = 0, yt, 2(yt)yt = 0.

(4.12)

The last two identities are direct consequences of 2(y)(y) = 0 for y  -1(0). For the first identity in (4.12), we note that

cos(t) = - yt, e1 = (yt), e2 sin(t) = - yt, e2 = - (yt), e1

.

Taking time-derivatives, and the identity sin(t)e2 + cos(t)e1 = -yt, we deduce that

t sin(t) = - 2(yt)yt, e2 t cos(t) = - 2(yt)yt, e1

 t = 2(yt)yt, yt .

This completes the proof of (4.2).
