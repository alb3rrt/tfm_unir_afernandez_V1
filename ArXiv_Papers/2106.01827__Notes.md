## Abstract

The article proposes a computer program for calculating economic crises according to the generalized mathematical model of S.V. Dubovsky. This model is represented by a system of ordinary nonlinear differential equations with fractional derivatives in the sense of Gerasimov-Caputo with initial conditions. Furthermore, according to a numerical algorithm based on an explicit nonlocal finite-difference scheme, oscillograms and phase trajectories were constructed. It is shown that changing the orders of fractional derivatives in the model can give rise to various modes, for example, damped modes with a steady-state amplitude. It is concluded that the orders of fractional derivatives are responsible for the intensity of the process.
