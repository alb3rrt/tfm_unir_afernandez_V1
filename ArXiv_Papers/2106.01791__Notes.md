## Abstract

We consider interacting massive scalar quantum field theory in the future Rindler wedge. This is a model example of quantum field theory in curved space--time. On this simple example we show how dynamics of correlation functions depends on the choice of initial Cauchy surface, basis of modes and on the choice of initial state build with the use of the corresponding creation and annihilation operators. We show which choice of modes in the future Rindler wedge respects Poincare symmetry. But we do not restrict our attention only to these modes and the corresponding state.
