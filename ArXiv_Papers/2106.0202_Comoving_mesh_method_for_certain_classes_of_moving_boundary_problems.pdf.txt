Abstract A Lagrangian-type numerical scheme called the "comoving mesh method" or CMM is developed for numerically solving certain classes of moving boundary problems which include, for example, the classical Hele-Shaw flow problem and the well-known mean curvature flow problem. This finite element scheme exploits the idea that the normal velocity field of the moving boundary can be extended throughout the entire domain of definition of the problem using, for instance, the Laplace operator. Then, the boundary as well as the finite element mesh of the domain are easily updated at every time step by moving the nodal points along this velocity field. The feasibility of the method, highlighting its practicality, is illustrated through various numerical experiments. Also, in order to examine the accuracy of the proposed scheme, the experimental order of convergences between the numerical and manufactured solutions for these examples are also calculated.

1 Introduction

We are interested in the numerical approximation of solutions to certain classes of moving boundary problems for d-dimensional (d = 2, 3) bounded domains that includes,
specifically, the so-called single phase Hele-Shaw problem. The classical Hele-Shaw
moving boundary problem seeks a solution to a Laplace's equation in an unknown
region whose boundary changes with time. In the present study, we are actually inter-
ested with the more general Hele-Shaw problem that also arises in shape optimization
problems. Let T > 0 be fixed and B be an open bounded set in Rd (d = 2, 3) with a smooth
boundary B. For t  [0, T], consider a larger open bounded set (t)  Rd containing B with boundary (t) := (t) such that B  (0) =  (i.e., dist(B, (0)) > 0). Denote by  the outward unit normal vector on the boundary of (t) \ B as illustrated in Fig. 1. Given the functions f : Rd × [0, T]  R, qB : B × [0, T]  R,  : Rd × [0, T]  Rd, the constant   R, and the initial profile 0 of (t), with Vn := Vn(x, t), x  (t), describing the outward normal velocity of the moving interface (t), we consider the
following moving boundary problem:

Problem 1. Find (t)  B and u(·, t) : (t) \ B  R such that

on (t), t  [0, T],

(1.1)



Vn = (-u + ) ·  +  on (t), t  [0, T], (0) = 0,

where   {0, 1}.

Here, for simplicity, we assume that the boundaries B and (t) are smooth, or equivalently, of class C. The topological situation illustrating the above problem is
depicted in Fig. 1. In (1.1), the parameter  indicates whether the boundary condition

Figure 1: The moving domain (t) and fixed domain B
on the fixed boundary B is a Dirichlet boundary condition ( = 0) or a Neumann boundary condition ( = 1). The fourth equation in (1.1) expresses the motion of the free boundary that evolves according to Vn = (-u + ) ·  + , where the function u satisfies the first three equations in (1.1). Here, equation (1.1) with f  0,   0 and
2

 = 0 is also known in the literature as the classical Hele-Shaw problem or simply the Hele-Shaw problem (see, e.g., [13]): Let us discuss more about the case f  0 and  = 0 in (1.1). If  = 1, qB > 0, and   0, problem (1.1) describes a model of the expanding (two-dimensional) Hele-Shaw flow (see, e.g., [5, 9, 10, 11, 34]) which provides a simple description either of the flow of a viscous Newtonian liquid between two horizontal plates separated by a thin gap, or of a viscous liquid moving under Darcy's law in a porous medium [6] (see also [30]). In a typical situation, u represents the pressure in an incompressible viscous fluid blob  \ B, and because the Neumann flux qB is positive, more fluid is injected through the fixed boundary B. As a result, the blob expands in time and is modelled by the moving boundary . The problem is sometimes formulated with the prescribed pressure (i.e., qB is now interpreted as a given pressure instead of a Neumann flux) on the fixed boundary, i.e., with the non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition u = qB on B (see, e.g., [14]). This situation corresponds to the case  = 0 in (1.1). For further classical applications of (1.1) at the current setting, we refer the readers, for example, to [5, 10, 11, 17]. In the case that   0, the given quantity may, in a sense, be interpreted as an (external) background flow. Here, we do not consider the interesting question of existence of unique classical solution to the general problem (1.1), but readers may refer to [13] for existence result in the case of f  0 and qB > 0. Nevertheless, this issue will be the topic of our future investigation. Meanwhile, results regarding existence of a weak solution to the Hele-Shaw problem via variational inequalities can be found in [10, 11, 22]. Of course, it would be nice if we could actually transform equation (1.1) into an elliptic variational inequality formulation such as in the case of the classical Hele-Shaw problem (see [11]). However, it seems that such method which employs the so-called Baiocchi transform [4] does not apply directly to our problem due to the presence of the external background flow . Moreover, we emphasize that we are not aware of any existing solution methods to treat the given problem. So, as in many past studies, this motivates us to at least find an approximate numerical solution to the problem for concrete cases by providing a simple and convenient numerical method in accomplishing the task.
Problem 1 is also related to the Bernoulli free boundary problem. Suppose now that f = f (x),   0, and  < 0, and that the shape solution to (1.1) happens to converge to a stationary point as t increases indefinitely, i.e., there exists a domain  such that Vn = 0 on  = , then we call (1.1) a generalized exterior Bernoulli-like free boundary problem:

Problem 2. Given a negative constant  and a fixed open bounded set B, find a bounded domain   B and a function u :  \ B  R such that

 

-u = f in  \ B,

(1 - )u + u ·  = qB on B,

(1.2)

 u = 0 and u ·  =  on .

Bernoulli problems find their origin in the description of free surface for ideal fluids (see, e.g., [18, 19]). However, it also arises in the context of optimal design, such as in electro chemical machining and galvanization [5, 29], as well as in insulation problems

3

[1, 15]. For some qualitative properties of solutions to the Bernoulli problem, including existence, classifications, and uniqueness of its solution, and some ideas about numerical approximations of its solutions via fixed-point iterations, we refer the readers to [16], as well as to the references therein (see also [33]).
As mentioned earlier, our main objective in this study is to present a simple numerical scheme for solving the moving boundary problem (1.1). Of course, there are already several numerical approaches to solve the present problem, especially in the case of the Hele-Shaw flow Vn = -u ·  (with f  0,   0,  = 0,  = 1, and qB > 0 in (1.1)). In fact, it is well-known that the Hele-Shaw problem can be solved numerically using the boundary element method which was employed, for instance, in [23], or the charge simulation method (CSM) applied in [26, 35]. The latter method can also be used to other two-dimensional moving boundary problems, but is not actually easy to utilized in the case of three-dimensional problems. To address this difficulty, the authors in [28] proposed an improvement of CSM by combining it with the level-set method. Still, however, to the best of our knowledge, no convenient and effective numerical approach has yet been developed to numerically solve the more general equation (1.1) with f  0 and   0. The purpose of this investigation, therefore, is to fill this gap by developing a numerical method to solve (1.1) with the following three main characteristics:
· firstly, as opposed to CSM, our proposed method is easier to implement and can easily treat three-dimensional moving boundary problems without ad hoc procedures;
· secondly, in contrast to existing traditional finite element methods used to solve many moving boundary problems, our propose scheme does not require mesh regeneration at every time step in the approximation process;
· and, lastly, our method can easily be adapted to solve other classes of moving boundary problems, such as the mean curvature problem.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formally introduce and give the motivation behind our proposed method which we termed as the `comoving mesh method'. We also write out the structure of the numerical algorithm for the method, and then illustrate its applicability in solving the Hele-Shaw problem. Moreover, we evaluate the correctness and accuracy of the scheme through the method of manufactured solution. Then, in Section 3, we will discuss how equation (1.1) is closely related to the so-called exterior Bernoulli problem in connection with a shape optimization formulation of the said free boundary problem (FBP). In addition, we numerically solve the FBP using our propose scheme. Meanwhile, in Section 4, as further application of CMM, we will also apply our method to curve shortening problem, thus showcasing the versatility of the method. Furthermore, in Section 5, we state and prove two simple qualitative properties of the proposed numerical approximation procedure. Finally, we end the paper by giving out a concluding statement in Section 6 and a brief remark about our future work.

2 The Comoving Mesh Method for the Hele-Shaw Problem
This section is mainly devoted to the introduction of the proposed method. The motivations behind its formulation are also given in this section. Moreover, the structure of the algorithm that will be used in the numerical implementation of the method is also provided here. This is followed by a presentation of two simple numerical examples illustrating the applicability of the scheme in solving concrete cases of problem (1.1), one with (·, t)  0 and the other one with (·, t)  constant = 0 on (t) (t  [0, T]). To check the accuracy of the proposed scheme, we also examine the error of convergence or EOC of the method with the help of the method of manufactured solutions [36].
2.1 Idea and motivation behind CMM
As alluded in Introduction, the main purpose of the present paper is the development of a simple Lagrangian-type numerical scheme that we call "comoving mesh method," or simply CMM, for solving a class of moving boundary problems. To begin with, we give out a naive idea of the method. For simplicity, we set  = 1. Let T > 0 be a given final time of interest, NT be a fixed positive integer, and set the time discretization stepsize as  := T/NT. For each time-step index k = 0, 1, · · · , NT, we denote the time discretized domain by k  (k) (similarly, k  (k)) and the associated time discretized function as uk  u(·, k), f k  f (·, k), qkB  qB(·, k), and k  (·, k). The rest of the notations used below are standard and will only be stressed out for clarity.
After specifying the final time of interest T > 0 and deciding the value of NT  N, a naive numerical method for the Hele-Shaw problem (1.1) consists of the following three steps:
Conventional scheme for (1.1) At each time t = k:
Step 1. The first step is to solve uk over the domain k \ B:
-uk = f k in k \ B, uk · k = qkB on B, uk = 0 on k.
Step 2. Then, we define the normal velocity of k in terms of the function uk and the normal vector k to k, i.e., we set Vnk := (-uk + k) · k +  on k.
Step 3. Finally, we move the boundary along the direction of the velocity field Vnk, i.e., we update the moving boundary according to
k+1 := x + Vnk(x)k(x) x  k .
However, there are two obstacles in the realization of this naive idea in a finite ele-
5

ment method (FEM). The first main difficulty is that if uk is a piecewise linear function

on a triangular finite element mesh, then Vnk only lives in the space P0(kh) (here, of

course,

k
h

denotes

the

exterior

boundary

of

the

triangulation

k
h

\

Bh

of

the

domain

 \ B with the maximum mesh size h > 0, at the current time step k). Unfortunately,

this local finite element space is not enough to uniquely define Vnk on nodal points of the mesh, and, in fact, it must belong to the (conforming piecewise) linear finite ele-

ment space P1(kh) in the third step. The second one is not actually an impediment in implementing the method, but more of a preference issue in relation to mesh genera-

tion. Typically, moving boundary problems requires mesh regeneration when solved

using finite element methods; that is, one needs to generate a triangulation of the do-

main k \ B at each time step k after the boundary moves. To circumvent these issues,

we offer the following remedies.

We first address the second issue. In order to avoid generating a triangulation of the

domain at every time step, we move not only the boundary, but also the internal nodes

of the mesh triangulation at every time step. By doing so, the mesh only needs to be

generated at the initial time step k = 0. This is the main reason behind the terminology

used to name the present method (i.e., the `comoving mesh' method). In order to move

the boundary and internal nodes simultaneously, we first create a smooth extension

wk of the velocity field Vnkk into the entire domain k \ B using the Laplace operator. This is done more precisely by finding wkh  P1(kh \ Bh; Rd) which is a finite element solution to the following Laplace equation:

- wk = 0 in kh \ Bh,

wk = 0 on Bh,

wk = Vnkk on kh,

(2.1)

given, and P1(kh \ Bh; Rd) denotes the Rd-valued piecewise linear function space on

Th(kh \ Bh). Then, kh+1 and Th(kh+1 \ Bh) = {Klk+1}lN=e1 are defined as follows:

(2.2) (2.3)

for all k = 0, 1, · · · , NT, see Fig. 2 for illustration.

Remark 1. If wkh is belongs to P2 or higher order finite element space, then, instead of (2.3), we set the triangular mesh Th(kh \ Bh) with the set of nodal points Nhk = {pkj }Nj=p1 :



Th (kh+1

:=

  Klk+1



pkj +1 Nlk+1

wkh(pkj ) Nlk.

(2.4)

Note that the definition of the (discrete) time evolution of the annular domain  \ B given in (2.2) clearly agrees with the original characteristic (at least for the interior

6

boundary) of its desired evolution. This is because the choice of extension for the vector field Vn fixes the boundary B of the interior domain B throughout the entire time evolution interval [0, T]. It is worth to emphasize that a similar idea is adopted in the so-called traction method developed by Azegami [2] for shape optimization problems (see also [3]).

On the other hand, concerning the first issue, we treat the P0(kh)-function by using a Robin approximation wk · k + wk = Vnkk of wk = Vnkk in (2.1), where  > 0 is a sufficiently small fixed real number. In other words, given  > 0, we define wkh  P1(kh \ Bh; Rd) as the finite element solution to the following mixed Dirichlet-Robin boundary value problem:

 

-wk = 0

wk = 0

 wk · k + wk = Vnkk

where H1B,0( \ B; Rd) denotes the Hilbert space {  H1( \ B; Rd) |  = 0 on B}. Obviously, the integral equation in (2.6) can be evaluated even for Vnkk  P0(kh).
To summarize the above idea, we provide the following algorithm for the comoving
mesh method.

2.2 Application of CMM to a classical Hele-Shaw problem

In this subsection, we apply the comoving mesh method to solve two concrete examples of problem (1.1). First, let us consider the classical Hele-Shaw problem:

 

-u u · 

= =

u=0

on (t), t  [0, T],

(2.7)



Vn = -u ·  (0) = 0.

on (t),

t  [0, T],

Note that, because of the maximum principle and the unique continuation property [24], u is positive in  \ B. This means that u ·  < 0 on the moving boundary, and, in this case, since the normal velocity Vn is always positive, the hypersurface expands.

Numerical Example 1. In this example, the initial profile 0 of the moving domain (t) (t  [0, T]) is given as an ellipse, as shown in Fig. 3a (along with its mesh triangulation), and
the final time of interest is set to T = 2. Algorithm 1 is executed using mesh sizes of uniform width h  0.1 with parameter value  = 0.1 and time step size  = 0.1.

The numerical results of the present experiment are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3b, in par-

ticular, shows the shape of the annular domain at the final time of interest T = 2 (with

its mesh profile). Meanwhile, Fig. 3c plots the trajectory of the boundary nodes, and we

see from this figure that the nodes are well-spaced at every time-step. The last plot, Fig.

2.3 EOC of CMM for the Hele-Shaw problem

To check the accuracy of CMM for Hele-Shaw problems of the form (1.1), with  = 1 and  = 0, we use the method of manufactured solutions [36]. Therefore, we construct a proper manufactured solution for the Hele-Shaw problem (1.1).

Proposition 1. We suppose (x, t) is a smooth function with  < 0 for x  B and || = 0

on { = 0}, for t  [0, T]. We define f := , qB := - · ,  :=

-

t ||2

+1



(where t means the partial derivative of  with respect to t), and 0 := {(x, 0) < 0}. Then, u(x, t) = -(x, t) and (t) := {x  Rd | (x, t) < 0)} satisfy the moving boundary value

problem (1.1) with  = 1 and  = 0.

Proof. The proposition is easily verified by straightforward computation noting that the

normal velocity of the moving boundary Vn and the unit normal vector  with respect

to the moving boundary (t) can be expressed in terms of the level set function ; that

is,

Vn

=

-

t ||

and



=

 ||

(see, e.g.,

[27]).

We check the experimental order of convergence (EOC) by comparing the approximate solution ukh with the manufactured solution k. In this case, k is viewed as the interpolated exact solution to the solution space of the discretized problem. Now, with
regards to EOC, we define the numerical errors as follows:

err := max max dist(x, (k)),
0 k NT xkh

errX k

:=

max
0 k NT

ukh - hu(·, k) X k ,

where X k  {L2(kh \ B), H1(kh \ B)}, and h : H1()  P1(Th()) is the projection map such that hu(p) = u(p) for all nodal points p  Nh of Th().

Numerical Example 2. As an example, we perform a numerical experiment with the following conditions:   {10-4, 10-2}, h   = 0.05,

(x, t)

:=

x12 2(t +

1)

+

t

x22 +1

t  [0, 1],

(x := (x1, x2)),

so B := x  R2 x12 + x22 0.52 and 0 := x  R2 0.5x12 + x22 < 1 .
The computational results of Example 2 are shown in Fig. 4. The initial profile of  is depicted in Fig. 4a, while its shape at time T = 1 is shown in Fig. 4b. Meanwhile, Fig. 4c and Fig. 4d plot the evolution of the moving boundary  (on the first quadrant) from initial to final time of interest T = 1 with  = 10-4 and  = 10-2, respectively. Notice that we get more stable evolution, in the sense that the boundary nodes are well-spaced at every time step, of the moving boundary for a higher value of  than with a lower value (refer, in particular, to the encircled region in the plots). In fact, for higher values of , we observe better mesh quality than when  is of small magnitude. Consequently, we notice in our experiment the obvious fact that there is a trade-off between accuracy and stability of the scheme when  is made smaller compared to the time step size   h.

In fact, as already expected, the scheme is stable when the step size is taken relatively small compared to . Results regarding accuracy are illustrated in further illustrations below.
We also check how the error changes with the magnitude of the time step  along with the maximum mesh size h of the triangulation Th by calculating the EOC of the present numerical example. Here, the mesh size h is as large as the time step , i.e., h  . The results are depicted in Fig. 5. Notice in these figures that the orders are mostly linear when  is sufficiently small, except, of course, in Fig. 5b. Nevertheless, we can expect that the numerical solution converges to the exact solution by reducing the time step as well as the mesh size in the numerical procedure. Based on these figures, the error is evidently reduced by choosing smaller . However, in Fig. 5b, for sufficiently small , the errors become saturated and the saturated values decrease with order O().

3 Bernoulli Free Boundary Problem
In this section, we showcase the practicality of the method for solving stationary free boundary problems.

3.1 Application of CMM in solving the Bernoulli free boundary problem

Here, we shall show that our proposed finite element scheme can actually be applied

to numerically solved the well-known Bernoulli problem, a prototype of stationary free

boundary problems [16]. The applicability of our method in solving the said problem

is not surprising since the kinematic boundary condition Vn = (-u + ) ·  +  with   0 where  < 0, in fact provides a descent direction for a gradient-based descent

algorithm for solving the Bernoulli problem in the context of shape optimization. To see

this, let us briefly discuss how the Bernoulli problem can be solved using the method

of shape optimization, a well-established tool for solving FBPs [7].

The Bernoulli problem splits into two types: (i) the exterior case, similar to the topo-

logical profile of the domain  \ B examined in previous sections, and (ii) the interior

case which is the exact opposite of the exterior problem (i.e., the free boundary is the

interior part of the disjoint boundaries). In the discussion that follows, we shall focus

on the former case which can be described by the following overdetermined boundary

value problem:

 

-u = 0 in  \ B,

u = 1 on B,

(3.1)

 u = 0 and u ·  =  on .

There are several ways to reformulate the above problem into a shape optimization setting (see, e.g., [33] and the references therein), and the one we are concerned with here is the minimization of the shape functional [12]

J() = |(u())|2 + 2 dx,

(b)  vs err

where u = u() is a unique weak solution to the underlying well-posed state problem:

Find u  H1,0( \ B), with u = 1 on B, such that

u :  dx = 0,
\B

  H1,0( \ B).

(3.2)

We like to emphasize here that the positivity of the Dirichlet data on the fixed boundary B implies that the state solution u is positive in . This, in turn, yields the identity |u|  -u ·  on  because u takes homogenous Dirichlet data on the free boundary .
The solution to the exterior Bernoulli problem (3.1) is equivalent to finding the solution pair (, u()) to the shape optimization problem

min J(),

(3.3)



where u()  H1,0( \ B), with u = 1 on B, satisfies the variational problem (3.2). This results from the necessary condition of a minimizer of the cost functional J(), that is,

dJ()[V ]

has to hold for all sufficiently smooth perturbation fields V . Here,  stands for a deformation of  along the deformation field V vanishing on B. For more details of how to compute dJ()[V ], and for more discussion on shape optimization methods, in general, we refer the readers to [7] and [37].
To numerically solve (3.3), a typical approach is to utilize the shape gradient (i.e., the kernel of the shape derivative dJ()[V ], see, e.g., [7, Thm. 3.6, p. 479­480]) in a gradient-based descent algorithm. For instance, given enough regularity on the boundary  and on the state u, we can take 0  V = - 2 - (u · )2   L2(). This
implies that, formally, for small t > 0, we have the following inequality

J(t)

J(

)

O(t2)

= J() + t 2 - (u · )2 Vn ds + O(t2)


= J() - t |Vn|2 ds + O(t2) < J().


Here, we observe that we can simply take (-u ·  + ) as the descent vector V . This issues from the fact that u ·  +  < 0 on  since |u|  -u ·  on . Indeed, with

14

V = (-u ·  + ), we see that

J(t) = J() + t (u ·  + ) (-u ·  + ) Vn ds + O(t2)

= J() + t (u ·  + ) |Vn|2 ds + O(t2) < J().
 <0

It is worth to mention here that simply taking the kernel of the shape derivative of the cost function (multiplied to the normal vector on the free boundary) as the deformation field V may lead to subsequent loss of regularity of the free boundary, hence forming oscillations of the free boundary. To avoid such phenomena, the descent vector is, in most cases, replaced by the so-called Sobolev gradient [31]. A strategy to do this is to apply the traction method or the H1 gradient method which are popular smoothing techniques in the field of shape design problems (see, e.g., [3]).
Now, the evolution of the free boundary (t) of the Bernoulli problem according to a shape gradient-based descent algorithm (see, e.g., [12]) describes a similar evolutionary equation for the Hele-Shaw problem with the moving boundary given as (t):

 

-u u

where T > 0. Before we give a concrete numerical example illustrating the evolution of
the solution of (3.4), note that the convergence of the solution of the moving boundary
problem in CMM to a stationary (non-degenerate) shape solution will be given in Sec-
tion 5 (see Proposition 3). Furthermore, we infer from this claim that the convergence of (t) to , as time t increases indefinitely, does not depend on the choice of the
value of the parameter  in the -approximation of the normal-velocity flow Vn of the moving boundary (t).

Numerical Example 3. Let us now consider a concrete example of the exterior Bernoulli prob-
lem and apply CMM to approximate its numerical solution. We consider the problem with  = -10, and define the fixed interior domain as the L-shaped domain B = (0.25, 0.25)2 \ [0.25, 0.25]. Also, we solve the problem for different choices of initial boundary (0). In particular, we consider it to be a circle 01, a square with rounded corners 02, and a rectangle with rounded corners 03. We carry out the approximation procedure discretizing these domains with (initial) triangulations having mesh of width h  5 × 23. We set the time step to  = 0.001 and take T = 1 as the final time of interest. Hence, the procedure terminates after NT = 1000 time steps. Lastly, we set the CMM parameter  to 0.1.

The results of the experiments are summarized in Fig. 6­Fig. 9. Fig. 6 depicts the initial mesh triangulation of each mentioned test cases. Fig. 7, on the other hand, shows the mesh profile after NT time steps (i.e., the computational mesh profile at time

15

T = 1). Notice from these plots that the mesh quality actually deteriorates in the sense that the area of some of the triangles become very small (see the part of the discretized shape near the concave region of the domain in Fig. 7). This is not actually surprising since we do not imposed any kind of mesh improvement or re-meshing during the approximation process. Of course, as a consequence, the step size may become too large in comparison with the minimum mesh size of the triangulation after a large number of time steps have passed, and this may cause instability within the approximation scheme. Even so, we do not encounter this issue in these present test examples. Meanwhile, to illustrate how the nodes changes after each time step, we plot the boundary nodes' trajectory from initial to final time step for each test cases, and these are projected in Fig. 8. Moreover, in Fig. 9a, we plot the shapes at T = 1 (i.e., the shape ki , i = 1, 2, 3, at final time step k = NT) against each of the test cases. Notice that the computed shapes are slightly different, but are nevertheless close to the shape obtained via shape optimization methods (see [33]). This is primarily due to the fact that the number of triangles within the initial mesh profile generated for each test cases are also different. Nonetheless, as we tested numerically, the resulting shapes at time T = 1 for each cases coincide at one another under smaller time steps and finer meshes. Lastly, Fig. 9b graphs the histories of the L2()-norms between u and , for each cases.
We mention here that we also tested the case where the initial shape actually contains entirely the closure of the stationary shape (which is typically the experimental setup examined in the literature), and, as expected, we also get an almost identical shape with the ones obtained for the given cases. Here, we opted to consider the abovementioned test setups to see whether our scheme works well in the case that the initial shape does not contain some regions of the stationary shape.

4 Mean Curvature Flow Problem

4.1 Application of CMM to mean curvature flow problem

As further application of CMM, we will showcase in this section how CMM can easily be adapted to handle mean curvature flows:

Vn = - on (t),

(4.1)

where,  denotes curvature of (t) for d = 2, or the sum of principal curvature of (t)

for d 3. The corresponding problem under this situation is often referred to in the literature as the curve shortening problem when d = 2 (see, e.g., [20, 21]), and is called, in

general (i.e., d 3), as the mean curvature flow problem (see, e.g., [8, 25]). Here, we use the

latter terminology in any dimensional case. For other numerical methods used to solve

the problem such as the CSM coupled with the level-set method, or via a finite element

method using approximation by a reaction-diffusion equation, we refer the readers to

[28] and [32], respectively. Now, let k be the curvature of k = k. Similarly to (2.5), the smooth extension of
Vn according to CMM satisfies the following problem for wkh : kh \ Bh  Rd:

 

-wk = 0

wk = 0

 wk · k + wk = -kk

in kh \ Bh, on Bh, on kh.

(4.2)

In variational form, the system of partial differential equations (4.2) is given as follows: find wk  H1B,0(k \ B; Rd) such that

(4.3)

where div denotes the tangential divergence (see, e.g., [7, Chap. 9, Sec. 5.2, eq. (5.6), p. 495] or [27, Chap. 3, Sec. 1, Def. 2.3, p. 53]). Evaluating the mean curvature term numerically is quite problematic, especially when implemented in a finite element method. Here, however, we point out that to numerically evaluate the integral consisting of the mean curvature , one may utilize the so-called Gauss-Green formula on  (see, e.g., [27, Chap. 2, Sec. 2, Thm. 2.18, p. 56] or [7, eq. (5.27), p. 498]):

 · v ds = div v ds,

(4.4)





which is valid for C2 regular boundary  and vector-valued function v :   Rd that belongs at least to C1(; Rd). Hence, the variational problem (4.3) can be solved at once without the need to evaluate the mean curvature k at every time step k = 0, 1, · · · , NT.

18

To implement in a finite element method the right side integral appearing in the

variational problem (4.3), we remark that the identity div  = div  - ( · ) ·  on

, actually holds for smooth  and  :   Rd. So, for a polygonal mesh h and

h := h, with triangular mesh Th and element ih  Pl(Th) (i = 1, 2, . . . , d), l  N,

we have

h divh h ds = h

Numerical Example 4. With the above at hand, we perform a numerical experiment for the

mean curvature flow problem which we execute under the following conditions:  = 0.1,

 = 5 · 10-4, with the maximum mesh size of width h  0.2, t  [0, T], T = 1, 0 :=

2 , and B is the circle C(0, 0.5) as in Example 2.

The results of the experiment are summarized in Fig. 10. Here, the initial, plotted with its mesh triangulation, is shown in Fig. 10a. Fig. 10b, on the other hand, plots the mesh profile at selected time steps. The third figure, Fig. 10c, depicts the evolution of the moving boundary from its initial profile (outermost exterior boundary) up to its final shape (innermost exterior boundary), and at some intermediate time steps. Fig. 10d again plots the time evolution of the moving boundary, but now viewed on the first quadrant and with emphasis to the location of the boundary nodes at time steps k = 100j, for j = 0, 1, . . . , 20. As expected, the curvature flow equation Vn = - on (t) has the effect of flattening uneven parts of the boundary, hence shrinking the whole domain into the geometric profile of the interior boundary B (as evident in the figures), after a sufficiently large time has passed.

4.2 EOC of CMM for the mean curvature flow problem

We also check the accuracy of CMM for curvature flows in the same way as in subsection 2.3. That is, we construct a manufactured solution and then compare the numerical solution obtained through the proposed scheme. For this purpose, we state the following construction of the appropriate manufactured solution.

Proposition 2. We suppose (x, t) is a smooth function with  < 0 for x  B and || = 0

on { = 0} for t  [0, T].

We define g : Rd × [0, T]

as

g

and

Then, the moving domain (t)

:=

{x

|

(x, t) < 0)} satisfy Vn = - + g on (t), t  [0, T], and (0) = 0.

Proof. The proposition easily follows from straightforward computation of Vn, , and the mean curvature  in terms of the level set function .

We now examine the EOC of the scheme when applied to solving the mean cur-
vature problem using Proposition 2. In this experiment, the domains are initially discretized with uniform mesh size of width h  100 × , and we set  = 1/(100 · 2m), where m = 0, 1, . . . , 5. The results are depicted in Fig. 11. We observe from Fig. 11a an EOC of order one for  against the boundary error err. On the other hand, it seems

that, for h  100 × , we only have a sub-linear order for the EOC with respect to  against err. In fact, the plot shown in Fig. 11b shows that the behavior due to the change of  is similar to Fig. 5b. This is because CMM is an explicit method, and since the right side of the variational problem (4.3) contains the mean curvature term which is a second derivative, then the time step size  must be well less than h to stabilize the numerical calculation. In relation to this, notice in Fig. 11a that there is no corresponding error value for  = 1/(100 · 25) in case of  = 10-3. This is because the scheme is becoming unstable after several time steps under this set of parameter values, causing the algorithm to stop. So, for these reasons, we perform another experiment where h  200 ×  and consider different values for . The results are summarized in Fig. 12 where we now observe an almost linear convergence behavior of the scheme with respect to  against the boundary err as conspicuous in Fig. 12b. However, for small times steps, err is already saturated for  of magnitude around or less than 10-3 as evident in Fig. 12a. Nevertheless, the error values became smaller, which implies that the numerical solution is improved by taking sufficiently small time steps.

5 Some Qualitative Properties of CMM

In this section, we state and prove two simple properties of CMM related to the convergence to a stationary point  of the moving boundary (t), t 0, under a general
description of the normal flow Vn, and another property we call the -approximation property of CMM. In relation to the former result, let us consider the following abstract
autonomous moving boundary problem.

Problem 3. Given the initial profile 0 and a real-valued function F( · ; ) :   R, find a moving surface (t), t 0, which satisfies

Vn(x, t) = F(x; (t)), x  (t), t 0, (5.1)
(0) = 0. The particular forms of F(x; (t)) that are of interest here are as follows: · F(x; (t)) = (-u + ) ·  +  in (1.1);

· F(x; (t)) = - in (4.1).
Next, we define a stationary solution to Problem 3.
Definition 1. A domain  is said to be a stationary solution to Problem 3 if  = , and F(x; ) = 0 for almost every x  .

Then, we associate with Problem 3 the -regularized moving boundary problem given as follows:

Problem 4. Let B and  be two bounded domains with respective Lipschitz boundary B and  :=  such that B  . Given the initial profile 0, a real-valued function F( · ; )  L2(), and a fix number  > 0, we seek to find a moving surface (t), which satisfies

With respect to Problem 4, a stationary solution  is define as follows.
Definition 2. A domain  is said to be a stationary solution to Problem 4 if  = , and w  H1B,0( \ B; Rd) satisfies the variational equation.



w :  dx + w ·  ds

\B



= F(·; ) ·  ds,


  H1B,0( \ B; Rd),

and w ·  = 0 on .

(5.3) (5.4)

For Lipschitz domain  \ B and F( · ; )  L2(), the variational problem (5.3) can be shown to have a weak solution w  H1( \ B; Rd) via Lax-Milgram lemma. With
the above definition of a stationary point, we now state and prove our first result.

Proposition 3. We suppose   B,  =  is Lipschitz, and F( · ; )  L2(). Then, the following conditions are equivalent:

(i)  is a stationary solution to Problem 3,

(ii)  is stationary solution to Problem 4, for any  > 0,

(iii)  is stationary solution to Problem 4, for some  > 0.

Proof. Consider equation (5.2) over the stationary shape  with Lipschitz boundary . For the implication (i)  (ii), we assume that L2()  F( · ; ) = 0, and we need to show that w ·  = 0 on . To do this, we apply integration by parts to (5.3), and note
that w = 0 on B, to obtain

0

|w|2 ds = -




w

0.

Evidently, w  0 on , and in particular, w ·  = 0 on .
The proof of the direction (ii)  (iii) is trivial. Finally, for the implication (ii)  (iii), we need to prove that if w ·  = 0 on , where w satisfies the system (5.2) on  \ B, then F = 0 on . In (5.3), we take  = w  H1B,0( \ B; Rd) so that we get



w : w dx + |w|2 ds = F( · ; ) · w ds = 0.

\B





This implies, obviously, that w  0 on . Going back to (5.3), we see that  F( · ; ) ·  ds = 0, for all   H1B,0( \ B; Rd), from which we conclude that F = 0 on . This proves the assertion.

In the rest of this section, we want to prove what we call the -approximation prop-
erty of CMM. For this purpose, we again fix  and B and suppose that  and B are Lipschitz regular. Given a function g :   Rd, our main concern is the convergence

23

of its Robin approximation to an original Dirichlet boundary condition associated with the following Laplace equation with pure Dirichlet boundary condition:

- v = 0 in  \ B, v = 0 on B, v = g on .

(5.5)

For a given data g  H1/2(; Rd) and Lipschitz domain  \ B, it can be shown via LaxMilgram lemma that the corresponding variational equation of (5.5) admits a unique weak solution v  H1( \ B; Rd).
Now, we consider system (5.5) and denote its solution, depending on g  H1/2(; Rd), by vi := v(gi). Also, we define the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map  : H1/2(; Rd)  H-1/2(; Rd). Then, we have the following lemma whose proof is given in the Appendix.
Lemma 5.1. The map ( · , · ) : H1/2(; Rd) × H1/2(; Rd)  R defined as (g1, g2) := (g1, g2)L2(;Rd), for g1, g2  H1/2(; Rd), is an inner product on H1/2(; Rd), and is equivalent to the usual norm on H1/2(; Rd).
Now, for  > 0 and g  H1/2(; Rd), we define g such that g + g = v ·  + v =: g, and consider the boundary value problem (5.5) with v and g replaced by v and g, respectively, and, instead of the Dirichlet condition, we imposed on  the Robin condition v ·  + v = g. More precisely, we consider the mixed Dirichlet-Robin problem

- v = 0 in  \ B, v = 0 on B, v ·  + v = g on .

(5.6)

Let us define the bilinear form a( · , · ) as follows:

a(, ) := H-1/2 ( + I),  H1/2 = (, ) + (, )L2(;Rd).

Then, we may write a weak formulation on  for g as follows: find g  H1/2(; Rd)

such that

a(g, ) = (g, )L2(;Rd),

for all   H1/2(; Rd).

(5.7)

Again, the existence of unique weak solution g  H1/2(; Rd) to the above variational

problem can be proven using Lax-Milgram lemma.

We now exhibit our second convergence result in the following proposition which

simply states the convergence of the Robin approximation to the original Dirichlet data in L2() sense as the parameter  goes to zero provided that the Neumann data g is

square integrable.

Proposition 4. Let g  H1/2(; Rd) and  be Lipschitz regular. If g  L2(; Rd), then the following estimate holds g - g L2(;Rd)  g L2(;Rd).

Proof. Taking the test function in (5.7) as  := g - g  H1/2(; Rd) gives us the fol-

lowing sequence of equations: a(g - g, g - g) = (g, g - g)L2(;Rd) - (g, g - g) -

(g, g - g)L2(;Rd) = -(g, g - g).

This gives us the estimate

g - g

2 L2 (;R d )

-(g, g - g). Furthermore, if g  L2(; Rd), then we can write this inequality as

g - g L2(;Rd)  g L2(;Rd), as desired.

6 Conclusion
We have developed a finite element scheme we called the `comoving mesh method' or CMM for solving certain families of moving boundary problems. We applied the proposed scheme in solving the classical Hele-Shaw problem and the exterior Bernoulli free boundary problem. In the latter case, we found that the generalized Hele-Shaw problem with normal velocity flow Vn = -u ·  + , where  < 0 converges to a stationary point which coincides with the optimal shape solution of the said free boundary problem. We have also demonstrated the applicability of CMM in solving a moving boundary problem involving the mean curvature flow equation Vn = -. The numerical experiments performed here showed that the experimental order of convergence of the approximate solutions obtained using CMM are mostly linear for both the HeleShaw problem and the mean curvature problem. In case of the former problem, this linear order of convergence was seen for time step sizes that is as large as the mesh size value. On the other hand, for the mean curvature problem, it was observed that the magnitude of the time step-size has to be well less than the width of the mesh in order for the numerical scheme to be stable and obtained a (nearly) linear order of convergence with respect to the parameter  against the boundary shape error. Finally, we have also presented two simple properties of CMM pertaining to its stationary solution and a convergence result regarding the -approximation of Vn.
In our next investigation, we will apply the method in solving more general moving boundary problems such as the Stefan problem and the two-phase Navier-Stokes equations. Moreover, we want to treat the Gibbs-Thomson law which assumes the condition u =  on the moving boundary.
A Proof of Lemma 5.1
Let us now prove Lemma 5.1.
Proof. Consider system (5.5) whose solution is given by vi := v(gi). Also, consider the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map  : H1/2(; Rd)  H-1/2(; Rd). Then, for g1, g2  H1/2(; Rd), the binary operation (g1, g2) := (g1, g2)L2(;Rd) is an inner product on H1/2(; Rd). Indeed, we have the following arguments
(i) since, for any g3  H1/2(; Rd) and c  R, we have ((cg1 + g2), g3)L2(;Rd) = (cv1 + v2) ·  v3 ds = c(g1, g3)L2(;Rd) + (g2, g3)L2(;Rd), then ( · , · ) is
linear with respect to its first argument;
(ii) the binary operation ( · , · ) is positive definite because, for any g2  H1/2(; Rd), we have (g, g)L2(;Rd) = (v · )v ds = \B |v|2 dx 0;
(iii) also, it is point-separating, that is (g, g)L2(;Rd) = 0 if and only if g  0; and,
(iv) lastly, the operation is symmetric because (g1, g2)L2(;Rd) = (v1 · )v2 ds = \B v1 : v2 dx =  v1(v2 · ) ds = (g1, g2)L2(;Rd).
25

Additionally, for Lipschitz , the inner product ( · , · ) is equivalent to the natural one in H1/2(; Rd). Here, H1/2(; Rd) is viewed as the image of the trace operator  on  (i.e., Im() = (H1(; Rd))). Consequently, by Riesz representation theorem, together with the embedding H-1/2(; Rd)  L2(; Rd)  H1/2(; Rd), we conclude that   Isom(H1/2(; Rd), H-1/2(; Rd)). This proves the lemma.
