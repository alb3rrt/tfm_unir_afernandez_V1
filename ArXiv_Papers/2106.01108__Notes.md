## Abstract

Since leader election is an important module in algorithms for various other tasks, the presented algorithm can be useful for speeding up other algorithms under the assumption of a strong scheduler. This leaves open the question: "can a deterministic algorithm be as fast as the randomized ones also under weaker schedulers?"
