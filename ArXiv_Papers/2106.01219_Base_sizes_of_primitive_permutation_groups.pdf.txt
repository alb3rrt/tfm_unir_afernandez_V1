BASE SIZES OF PRIMITIVE PERMUTATION GROUPS
MARIAPIA MOSCATIELLO AND COLVA M. RONEY-DOUGAL
Abstract. Let G be a permutation group, acting on a set  of size n. A subset B of  is a base for G if the pointwise stabilizer G(B) is trivial. Let b(G) be the minimal size of a base for G. A subgroup G of Sym(n) is large base if there exist integers m and r  1 such that Alt(m)r  G  Sym(m)  Sym(r), where the action of Sym(m) is on k-element subsets of {1, . . . , m} and the wreath product acts with product action. In this paper we prove that if G is primitive and not large base, then either G is the Mathieu group M24 in its natural action on 24 points, or b(G)  log n + 1. Furthermore, we show that there are infinitely many primitive groups G that are not large base for which b(G) > log n + 1, so our bound is optimal.
1. Introduction
Let the permutation group G act on a set  of size n. A subset B of  is a base for G if the pointwise stabilizer G(B) is trivial. Let b(G, ), or just b(G) when the meaning is clear, be the minimal size of a base for G.
In the 19th century, a problem that attracted a lot of attention was that of bounding the order of a finite primitive permutation group. It is easy to show that |G|  nb(G), so one can find an upper bound on the order of a permutation group by bounding the minimal base size. One of the earliest results in this direction is a theorem of Bochert [2] from 1889, which states that if G is a primitive permutation group of degree n not containing the alternating group Alt(n), then b(G)  n/2.
Bases also arise naturally in other contexts, which also benefit from good upper bounds on base size. For example, they have been used extensively in the computational study of finite permutation groups, where the problem of calculating base sizes has important practical applications. The knowledge of how an element g of G acts on a base B completely determine the action of g on , so once a base and a related data-structure called a strong generating set are known for G, we may store elements of G as |B|-tuples, rather than as permutations, of .
A permutation group G is large base if there exist integers m and r  1 such that Alt(m)r  G  Sym(m)  Sym(r), where the action of Sym(m) is on k-element subsets of {1, . . . , m} for some k, and if r > 1 then G has product action. Note that this includes the natural actions of Alt(n) and Sym(n).
Using the Classification of Finite Simple Groups (CFSG), and building on earlier work by Cameron [12], in 1984 Liebeck [20] proved the remarkable result that if G is a primitive group of degree n that is not large base, then b(G)  9 log n. (In this paper, all logarithms are to base 2, unless otherwise indicated.) Much more recently, Liebeck, Halasi and Mar´oti showed in [18] that for most non-large-base primitive groups G, the base size b(G)  2log n + 26; the second author and Siccha then noted in [24] that this bound applies to all primitive groups that are not large base.
The main result of this paper is as follows.
Theorem 1. Let G be a primitive permutation group of degree n. If G is not large base, then either G is the Mathieu group M24 in its 5-transitive action of degree 24, or b(G)  log n + 1. Furthermore, there are infinitely many such groups G for which b(G) > log n + 1.
If G is M24 in its 5-transitive action of degree 24 then b(G) = 7. In Theorem 4.3 we shall completely classify the non-large-base primitive groups G for which b(G) > log n + 1: there is one infinite family, and three Mathieu groups.
Our notation for groups is generally standard: for the orthogonal groups, by GOd(q) we denote the full isometry group of our standard quadratic form of type , as given in Definition 2.1.

Definition 1.1. Let G be almost simple with socle G0, a classical group with natural module V over a field of characteristic p. A subgroup H of G not containing G0 is a subspace subgroup if for each maximal subgroup M of G0 containing H  G0 one of the following holds.
(1) M = GU for some proper nonzero subspace U of V , where U is either totally singular, or nondegenerate, or, if G is orthogonal and p = 2, a nonsingular 1-space. If G0 = PSLd(q) then we shall consider all subspaces of V to be totally singular.
(2) G0 = Spd(2f ) and M  G0 = GO±d (2f ). A transitive action of G is a subspace action if the point stabiliser is a subspace subgroup of G.
Definition 1.2. Let G be almost simple with socle G0. A transitive action of G on  is standard if, up to equivalence of actions, one of the following holds, and is non-standard otherwise.
(1) G0 = Alt() and  is an orbit of subsets or partitions of {1, . . . , }; (2) G is a classical group in a subspace action.
Cameron and Kantor conjectured in [12, 13] that there exists an absolute constant c such that if G is almost simple with a faithful primitive non-standard action on a finite set  then b(G)  c. In [9, Theorem 1.3], Liebeck and Shalev proved this conjecture, but without specifying the constant c. Later, in a series of papers [5, 10, 7], Burness and others proved that b(G)  7, with equality if and only if G is M24 in its 5-transitive action of degree 24; that is, the Cameron-Kantor conjecture is true with the constant c = 7.
In stark contrast with the non-standard case, the base size of a group with a standard action can be arbitrarily large. The bulk of this article therefore concerns such actions. For many of the standard actions we shall use results due to Halasi, Liebeck and Mar´oti [18], however we sometimes require more precise bounds.
Notation 1.3. Let G be a classical group, with natural module V . We shall write S(G, k) for a Gorbit of totally singular subspaces of V of dimension k, and N (G, k) for a G-orbit of non-degenerate or non-singular subspaces of V of dimension k. For the orthogonal groups, let W be a space in the orbit if dk is even, and the orthogonal complement of such a space if dk is odd. Then we write N (G, k), with   {+, -}, to indicate that the restriction of the form to W is of type : if d is odd then the symbol N (G, k) is not used, since k or d - k is even.
The next result is a key tool in the proof of Theorem 1, but may be of independent interest. It will follow immediately from the results in Section 2: bounds for smaller dimensions may be found there.
Theorem 2. Let G be one of PGLd(q), PGUd(q), PSpd(q), or PGOd(q). Let k  {1, 2}, and let  be S(G, k) or N (G, k), with  either +, -, or blank.
(1) Assume that d  5, that G is PGLd(q), and that k = 2. Then b(G)  d/2 + 2. (2) Assume that d  3, that G is PGUd(q) or PSpd(q), and that k = 1. Then b(G)  d. (3) Assume that d  6, that G is PGOd(q), and that k = 1. Then b(G) = d - 1. (4) Assume that d  7, that G is not PGLd(q), and that k = 2. Then b(G)  d/2. Additionally, if q is even, d  6, and  is the right coset space of GO±d (q) in G = Spd(q), then b(G) = d.
We shall prove this result by giving explicit bases of the stated size. These bounds are very similar to those proved by Burness, Guralnick and Saxl in [8] for algebraic groups, although we consider the full projective isometry group. Unfortunately we were not able to directly transfer many of their proofs over to the finite case, but we have taken some inspiration from their arguments.
We notice in passing that the value of b(G, ) for  the right coset space of GO±d (q) in G = Spd(q) is only one less than the value of the largest irredundant base size for this action, as proved in [16]: in general these two quantities can be very different.

2. Explicit bases for some subspace actions

Let G be a finite almost simple classical group with natural module V . In this section we present explicit bases for the action of G on a G-orbit of totally singular, non-degenerate, or non-singular one- or two-dimensional subspaces of V , and for the action of Spd(q) on the right cosets of GO±d (q), with q even.
Definition 2.1. Let F = Fq2 in the unitary case, and F = Fq otherwise, and let  be the automorphism of F mapping x  xq. Write F for the non-zero elements of F.
We fix our standard classical forms and bases on V = Fd. Our standard basis for GLd(q) will be (v1, . . . , vd). If d = 2a then our standard unitary and symplectic forms B have basis (e1, . . . , ea, f1, . . . , fa) whilst if d = 2a + 1 then our standard unitary form has basis (e1, . . . , ea, f1, . . . , fa, x). In both cases, for all i and j we set B(ei, ej) = B(fi, fj) = 0, B(ei, fj) = i,j (the Kronecker ), B(ei, x) = B(fi, x) = 0, and B(x, x) = 1.
Our standard quadratic form Q, with symmetric bilinear form B, has basis

(e1, . . . , ea, f1, . . . , fa) 
(e1, . . . , ea, f1, . . . , fa, x, y) (e1, . . . , ea, f1, . . . , fa, x)

if d = 2a and Q is of + type, if d = 2a + 2 and Q is of - type, if d = 2a + 1,

where for all i and j we set Q(ei) = Q(fi) = 0, B(ei, fj) = i,j, B(ei, x) = B(fi, x) = B(ei, y) = B(fi, y) = 0, Q(x) = B(x, y) = 1 and Q(y) = , where X2 + X +   F[X] is irreducible. We will work, at times, with orthogonal groups of odd dimension in characteristic two, and this is our standard form in this case as well: see, for example, [25, p139] for more information.
A pair (u, v) of vectors in V is a hyperbolic pair if B(u, u) = B(v, v) = 0, B(u, v) = 1, and (in the orthogonal case) Q(u) = Q(v) = 0.

We now collect a pair of elementary lemmas. The first two parts of the following are well known, and the third is easy. By the support of a vector v, denoted Supp(v), we mean the set of basis vectors for which the coefficient is nonzero.
Lemma 2.2. Let W = Fdq with basis w1, . . . , wd, let H = GLd(q), and let A = { w1 , . . . , wd }.
(1) H(A) is a group of diagonal matrices, and is trivial when q = 2. (2) For all µ := (µ1, . . . , µd)  (Fq)d, let A(µ) = A{ µ1w1+· · ·+µdwd }. Then H(A(µ)) = Z(GLd(q)). (3) Let T = u, v  W , and let g  H be such that T g = T . If there exists an s  Supp(v) such that
for all t  Supp(u), the vector s / Supp(tg), then u g = u .

In the presence of a non-degenerate form, we can make stronger statements.

Lemma 2.3. Let B be a non-degenerate sesquilinear form on V = Fd, with d > 2. Let u, v  V be such that u, v is non-degenerate, and let g be an isometry of V such that ug = u for some   F.
(1) Assume that vg = v, for some   F. If (u, v, w) are such that 0 = w  u, v , and g stabilises 1u + 2v + 3w for some i  F with 13 = 0, then wg = w. Furthermore, if 2 = 0 then  = , and if, in addition, B(u, v) = 0 then  = -q.
(2) Assume instead that B is symmetric, and that (u, v) are a hyperbolic pair. If vg  u, v , then vg = -1v.

Proof. (1). Since u, v is non-degenerate, g preserves the decomposition V = u, v  u, v . Let

{w = w3, w4, . . . , wd} be a basis of u, v . Then there exist 3, . . . , d such that wg =

d i=3

iwi.

Further, there exists µ  Fq such that

d
µ(1u + 2v + 3w) = (1u + 2v + 3w)g = 1u + 2v + 3( iwi).
i=3
Hence µ =  = 3 and i = 0 for 4  i  d. Furthermore, if 2 = 0 then  = . The final claim is clear. (2). Let vg = u + v. From 1 = B(u, v) = B(ug, vg) = , we deduce that  = -1 = 0. Then

0 = Q(v) = Q(vg) = Q(u + v) = 

implies that  = 0.

2.1. Totally singular subspaces. In this subsection we consider the unitary, symplectic and orthogonal groups acting on S(G, k) for k  {1, 2}, where S(G, k) is as in Notation 1.3. We shall use without further comment the fact that the trace map from Fq2 to Fq, given by tr() =  + q, is surjective.
Lemma 2.4. Let G be PGUd(q), PSpd(q), PGOd(q), with d  5 if G is orthogonal, and d  3 otherwise, and let  = S(G, 1). Then the set B in Table 1 is a base for the action of G on . In particular, b(G)  d and if G is orthogonal then b(G)  d - 1.

Proof. Let H = GUd(q), Spd(q), or GOd(q). First let B be one of the sets listed in Table 1. A straightforward calculation shows that each subspace in B is singular, so B  . Let g  H(B). We shall show that g is scalar, from which the result will follow. To do so, we shall repeatedly apply Lemma 2.3(1), with
(u, v, w) set to be equal to various triples of vectors.
For PGU3(q) it suffices to apply Lemma 2.3(1) to (e1, f1, x). So we can assume that d  4. Apply Lemma 2.3(1), first to (e1, f1, ei) and then to (e1, f1, fj) to see that there exists   F such that

(2.1)

eig = ei, fjg = fj,

for 1  i  a and

2ja

if H is GUd(q) or Spd(q),

2  j  a - 1 if H is orthogonal.

Now, B(e1g, f1g) = 1 yields (2.2)

f1g = -qf1.

For PGU2a+1(q) the result follows by applying Lemma 2.3(1) to (e1, f1, x). For PGU2a(q), PSp2a(q) and PGO+2a(q), we deduce from B(e2g, f2g) = 1 that  = -q, hence if G is not orthogonal then g is scalar.
For PGO2a+1(q), applying Lemma 2.3(1) to (e1, f1, x) shows that xg = x = ±x. Similarly, for PGO-2a+2(q), applying Lemma 2.3(1) to both (e1, f1, x) and (e1, f1, y) yields xg = x = ±x and yg = y. Combining these with (2.1) and (2.2), we deduce that if H is orthogonal then g stabilizes ea, fa , and so stabilizes ea, fa . Then Lemma 2.3(2) shows that fag = fa, so g is scalar.

Lemma 2.5. Let G = PGLd(q) and let  = S(G, 2). Then the set B in Table 2 is a base for the action

Proof. Let g  GLd(q)(B): we shall show that g is scalar. The arguments for d = 4 are similar to, but easier than, those that follow, so let d  5, and let X = X1  · · ·  Xa-1. Then g stabilises
Y1  X = v2 + v4 + · · · + v2a-2 . Hence there exists   Fq such that

v2jg = v2j, for 1  j  a - 1.

Furthermore, g stabilises X1  Y2 = v1 , and hence v1g = v1 for some   F . Now, this and the fact that g stabilizes X2  · · ·  Xa = v3, v4, . . . , v2a-1, v2a means that we may apply Lemma 2.2(3), with u = v1 + v3 + · · · + v2a-1, v = v2 + v4 + · · · + v2a-2, and s = v2 to deduce that

v2i-1g = v2i-1, for 1  i  a.

Now, vdg  vd-1, vd if d = 2a is even (and vdg = vd otherwise), so Lemma 2.2(3), with T = Y2, u = v3 + v2a-2 + vd and s = v1 yields u g = u , so  =  and g is scalar.

Since

(2.3)

e1g = 1e1 + 2e2, e2g = 1e1 + 2e2 f1g = 1f1 + 2f2, f2g = 1f1 + 2f2.

Let A be as in Table 2, and let X = A . We shall first show that

(2.4)

eig = 1ei and fig = 2fi for i = {1, 3, 4, . . . , a - 1}, e2g = 2e2, f2g = 1f2.

Let U = V1  V2, and let W = U , so that W g = W . For 3  i  a - 1, the element g stabilises Ui := V1, V2, Wi , and so stabilises UiW = ei, fi . Then Lemma 2.2(3), with u = e1 +ei, v = e2 -f1 +fi, and s = f1 shows that there exists   F such that (e1 + ei)g = (e1 + ei) = 1e1 + 2e2 + eig, where the last equality holds by (2.3). Hence (2.4) holds for ei for i = 2. Similarly, for 3  i  a - 1, there exist ,   F such that
(e2 - f1 + fi)g = (e1 + ei) + (e2 - f1 + fi) = 1e1 + 2e2 - 1f1 - 2f2 + fig.

Equating coefficients, we deduce from fig  ei, fi that 2 = 0 and 2 = 1, so that f1g = 2f1, and also deduce that fig = 1ei + 2fi for 3  i  a - 1. For i  {1, 2}, let Ai = ei, fi . Then Ag1 = A1, so g stabilises A1  U = A2, and consequently stabilizes V1  A2 = e2 and V2  A2 = f2 , and so 1 = 1 = 0. Finally, B(e1g, f1g) = B(e2g, f2g) = 1 yields

1 = 2-q, and 2 = 2-q,

hence 1 = 2, and so (2.4) follows.

We now complete the proof that g = 1Id, so B is a base for G. If d = 2a - 1 then (2.4) yields

(X)g = x g = x . Let u = -e1 + f1 + x if G is orthogonal and u = -e1 + f1 + x otherwise. Then

Lemma 2.2(3), with v = e3 + f2 and s = f2, shows that u g = u , and so g = 1Id, as required.

u = -e1 + f1 + f2 + y and s = e2 shows that g is scalar.

Finally, consider PGU2a(q), PSp2a(q) and PGO+2a(q). From (2.4) we see that ea, fa g = ea, fa . Then, by Lemma 2.2(3), with T = V3, u = e1 + ea, and s = e2, we deduce that eag = 1ea. Moreover, letting u = e2 - ea - f1 + f2 + fa, v = e1 + ea, and s = e1, we see that u g = u , and so g = 1I2a, as required.

2.2. Non-degenerate subspaces. In this subsection we consider N (G, k), where k  2 and N (G, k) is as in Notation 1.3.

Lemma 2.7. Let d  3, let G = PGUd(q), and let  = N (G, 1). Then the set B in Table 3 is a base for the action of G on , so b(G)  d.

Proof. First assume that either d is odd or q > 2. Let  be a primitive element of F. Then for at least one value of µ in {, -1, 2} the vector v(µ) = v1 + · · · + vd-1 + µvd is non-degenerate, so B  . Let g  GUd(q)(B) and U = v1, . . . , vd-1 . Since U is non-degenerate, (U )g = vd g = vd , and hence g is diagonal by Lemma 2.2(1). Then g also stabilises v(µ) , and so is scalar, by Lemma 2.2(2).
For q = 2 and d even, g stabilises v1, v2  = v3, . . . , vd . Therefore Lemma 2.3(1), applied to (v1, v2, vi), for 3  i  d, shows that GUd(q)(B) is scalar.
When q is odd, PGOd(q) has two orbits of non-degenerate 1-spaces. If d is even then the orbits can be distinguished by considering the discriminant of the restriction of the quadratic form to the subspace, and the actions on the two orbits are equivalent, so it is enough to consider one of them. If d is odd then the orbits can be distinguished by the sign of the restriction of the form to the orthogonal complement.

Lemma 2.8. Let d  4, let G = PGOd(q) with  = - if d = 4, and let  be a G-orbit of non-degenerate

or non-singular 1-spaces. Then, up to equivalence, the set B in Table 3 is a base for the action of G on

In

addition,

Proof. The first that B

result for PGO-4 (3) is an easy calculation. Let H is contained in a single G-orbit of the appropriate

= GOd(q). We start with d  type. For GO-4 (q), all 1-spaces

5, in

and show x, y are

non-degenerate. For q odd, they are partitioned into (q + 1)/2 spaces v such that Q(v) is square, and

(q + 1)/2 with Q(v) non-square. Thus for q = 3, we may find v1, v2  x, y that are linearly independent,

not multiples of x, and such that Q(vi) is square, so that B is a subset of a G-orbit. For (d, ) = (5, +), notice that e1 + x  = e1, x - 2f1, e2, f2 is of plus type, and similarly for the rest

of B, so B  .

7
For (d, ) = (5, -), notice that w1()  = e1 - f1  = e1 + f1, x  e2, f2 , and the determinant of the restriction of the bilinear form B to e1 + f1, x is 4, which is square if and only if  is square. Since - is non-square,  is a square if and only if q  3 mod 4, so w1()   by [19, Prop 2.5.10]. Similarly, the restriction of B to w1() + e2  = e1 - f1 + e2  = e1 + f1, x, f1 - f2, e2 has determinant -4, which is always non-square, so w1() + e2  . Notice also that w2(1 + ) + f1 + x  = e2 - (1 + )f2 + f1 + x  = e2 + (1 + )f2, x - 2e1, f1, x - 2f2 , so a short calculation shows that this 1-space is also in . The argument for the remaining 1-spaces is similar, so B  .
We show next that B is a base, so let g  H(B). If d = 4 then the assumption that v2 is not a multiple of either x or v1 combines with Lemma 2.3(1) applied to (x, v1, e1) to show that g| x,y,e1 = ±I3. Since g stabilises x, y  = e1, f1 , Lemma 2.3(2) shows that g = ±I4. For d = 5 and  = -, it is straightforward to see that B forms a base for G. For d = 5 and  = +, notice that g stabilises both x  and x, e1 + x, f1 + x , so stabilises ei, fi for i = 1, 2. It is then easy to see that g| x,e1,e2,f1 = ±I4, from which Lemma 2.3(2) shows that g = ±I5.
For the rest of the proof, assume that d  6. In cases (, ) = (+, ) and  = - with q = 3, the arguments that B is contained in a single G-orbit of the appropriate type, and that B is a base for H = GOd(q), are identical to those for d  5, so we will omit them. In the other cases, let g  H(B). We shall show that B is contained in a single G-orbit and that g is scalar.
First consider  = +. Then Q(z) = 1 for all z  B, so B is contained in a single G-orbit. Let (w1(-1))g = (e1 + f1)g = µ(e1 + f1), so that µ  {±1}. For 2  i  a, there exists i  Fq such that
(w1(-1) + ei)g = i(w1(-1) + ei) = µ(w1(-1)) + eig.
Hence eig = (i - µ)(w1(-1)) + iei, and Q(eig) = 0 yields i = µ, so eig = µei for i  2. Similarly, fig = µfi for 2  i  a - 1, and Lemma 2.3(2) then yields fag = µfa. Since (w2(-1)) + e1  B, we deduce in the same way that e1g = µe1, and then (w1(-1))g = µe1 + f1g shows that f1g = µf1, as required.
Next consider  = - and q = 3. Then Q(y) = 2, so Q(y + w1(1)) = Q(y + e1 - f1) = 1. It is clear that Q(z) = 1 for all other z in B, so B is contained in a single G-orbit. Notice that g stabilises W1 := x, e1 + x, f1 + x = x, e1, f1 and also stabilises W2 := W1, w1(1) + y = e1, f1, x, y . Hence g stabilises W1  W2 = x + y , and so stabilises U := x, y and U . Then g stabilises w1(1) + y and w1(1)g  U , so g stabilizes y . Lemma 2.3(1), applied to both (x, y, ei) and (x, y, fj), yields eig = µei and fjg = µfj for 1  i  a and 1  j  a - 1. The result follows from Lemma 2.3(1) applied to (y, x, w1(1)) and Lemma 2.3(2) applied to (ea, fa).
Finally, consider (, ) = (-, ). First notice that g stabilises
V2 := w1()  = e1 + f1, x, e2, . . . , ea, f2, . . . , fa .
In particular eig = ui for some ui  V2 for 2  i  a. Hence there exist µ  {±1} and i  Fq such that
(w1() + ei)g = i(w1() + ei) = µ(w1()) + ui,
and so ui = eig = µei for 2  i  a. Similarly, fjg = µfj for 2  j  a - 1. Then applying Lemma 2.3(1) to (e2, f2, e1 + w2()) shows that e1g = µe1 and then f1g = µf1, by Lemma 2.3(2). We now deduce that xg  ea, fa, x , and so from w2(1 + ) + f1 + x  B we see that xg = µx. The result follows from Lemma 2.3(2).
We now prove that the bound for even-dimensional orthogonal groups in Lemmas 2.4 and 2.8 is tight.
Lemma 2.9. Let d  6 be even, and let G = PGO±d (q). Let A = { v1 , . . . , vd-2 } be a set of d - 2 one-dimensional subspaces of the natural module V for G. Then G(A) is nontrivial. In particular, if  is a G-orbit of 1-dimensional subspaces, then b(G, ) = d - 1.
Proof. Let H = GO±d (q), let W be any (d - 2)-space containing A , and let K denote the subgroup of H that acts as scalars on W . We shall show that there exists a nonscalar element of K, from which the result will follow.

If W is non-degenerate, then K contains a subgroup which acts as GO(W ) = 1 on W , so the result is immediate. Thus we may assume that W is degenerate, so U := Rad(W ) = W  W  is a non-zero subspace of W , of dimension 1 or 2.
First assume that there exists a u  U such that Q(u) = 0. This implies that q is even, so H has a single orbit on non-singular 1-spaces, and without loss of generality we can assume that u = e1 + f1. This implies that e1, f1  W . We define g  GL(V ) by
e1g = f1, f1g = e1, zg = z for all z  e1, f1 .
Let v  V . Then v = e1 + f1 + z, for some ,   Fq and z  e1, f1 , and it is easy to verify that Q(vg) = Q(v), and so g  H. Furthermore, if w  W then B(w, e1 + f1) = 0, so w = e1 + f1 + z, for some   Fq (recalling that q is even) and z  e1, f1 . Hence wg = w, so g  K, as required.
Assume instead that Q(u) = 0 for all u  U , and consider first the case dim(U ) = 1. Then we can write W = u  W , with Rad(W ) = 0. If q is even this contradicts the fact that dim W = d - 2 is even, so q is odd. There exists a u  V \ W such that B(u, u) = 0, and we let W1 = W, u . Then W1 is non-degenerate, and dim(W1) = d - 1, so dim(W1) = 1. Let z = W1, and define g  GL(V ) by
zg = -z, wg = w for all w  W1.
Let v  V . Then v = w + z, for some w  W1 and   Fq, so Q(vg) = Q(w - z) = Q(w) + (-)2Q(z) = Q(v), so g  K, as required.
Finally consider the case dim(U ) = 2. We fix u1  U \ {0}. There exists a vector t1  V \ W such that (u1, t1) is a hyperbolic pair. Furthermore, u1, t1   U is 1-dimensional, with basis u2, say, and there exists t2  u1, t1  \ W such that (u2, t2) is a hyperbolic pair. Since t1, t2  W , we may define an element g  GL(V ) by
t1g = t1 + u2, t2g = t2 - u1, wg = w for all w  W.
Let v  V . Then v = t1 + t2 + w for some ,   Fq and w  W , and so
Q(vg) = Q((t1 + u2) + (t2 - u1)) + Q(w) + B((t1 + u2) + (t2 - u1), w) = - +  + Q(w) + B(t1 + t2, w) = Q(v),
so g  K, as required.

Next, notice that g stabilises V1  V2 = e2 , so e2g = e2, where  = -q since B(e2g, f2g) = 1.

We shall show next that

(2.5)

eig = ei and fig = -qfi for 1  i  a - 1.

For 3  i  a - 1, the element g stabilises V1, V2, Wi  V1, V2  = ei, fi . Then Lemma 2.2(3), applied to T = Wi, first with u = e1 + ei and s = f2, since f2g  e2, f2 , and then with u = f2 + fi and s = e1, since e1g  V1, shows that there exist i, i, ,   F such that

(e1 + ei)g = i(e1 + ei) = (e1 + f1) + eig (f2 + fi)g = i(f2 + fi) = (-qf2 + e2) + fig.

Equating coefficients shows that e1g = e1, eig = ei, f2g = -qf2, and fig = -qfi. Finally,
B(e1g, f1g) = 1 yields  = , and so (2.5) follows.
Finally, we apply Lemma 2.2(3) to the final subspace, T = a, b say, in Table 4. When d is odd, setting u = a and s = e2 shows that a g = a , so  = -q and xg = x. If d is even, we deduce both that a g = a and b g = b , and hence g = Id.

A pair (u, v) of vectors is an elliptic pair if Q(u) = 1, Q(v) = , for some   F such that X2 + X +  is irreducible, and B(u, v) = 1. Any elliptic pair spans a 2-space of minus type.

Proof. Fix  such that X2 + X +  is irreducible, with  = Q(y) if  = -. Let a = d/2  4. One may check that the given ordered basis vectors for each 2-space in B form an elliptic pair, and so B  . For example, Q(e1 + f1) = 1, Q(e2 + f1 + f2) = B(e2, f2) = , and B(e1 + f1, e2 + f1 + f2) = B(e1, f1) = 1. Let H = GOd(q), and let g  H(B). To show that B is a base for G, it suffices to show that g is scalar.
We shall show first that there exists  = ±1 such that
(2.6) (e1 + f1)g = (e1 + f1), eig = ei for 2  i  a - 1, fig = fi for 3  i  a - 1.
Let U = V1, V2 = e1, e2, f1, f2 . Then g stabilises Ui := U, Wi for 3  i  a - 1, and so stabilises Ui  U  = ei, fi . Since g stabilises Wi and V1, there exist µi, i, ,   F such that
(e1 + ei + f1)g = µi(e1 + ei + f1) + i(e2 + ei + fi)  Wi
= (e1 + f1)g + eig = (e1 + f1) + (e2 + f1 + f2) + eig.
Since eig  ei, fi , looking at f2, we see that  = 0. Hence i = 0, and so (e1 + f1)g = (e1 + f1) and eig = ei for 3  i  a - 1. We now apply Lemma 2.3(2) to (ei, fi) to see that fig = -1fi for 3  i  a - 1.
To prove (2.6), it remains to prove that e2g = e2 = ±e2. Considering W3 shows that (e2 + e3 + f3)g = e2g + e3g + f3g = e2g + e3 + -1f3 = (e2 + e3 + f3) + µ(e1 + e3 + f1),
for some , µ  F. Then e2g  U , so considering f3 gives  = -1. Then considering e3 yields µ = ( - -1), and so e2g = -1e2 + ( - -1)(e1 + f1). Finally, Q(e2g) = 0 shows that  = -1 = ±1 and so (2.6) is verified.
Let A  B be as in Table 5, and let X = A . Then g stabilises X. If we can show that either of e1g = e1 or f1g = f1, then it follows from (2.6) that the same is true for the other. In particular, this will imply that e1, f1 g = e1, f1 . It will then follow from U g = U that e2, f2 g = e2, f2 . Hence, it will

follow from Lemma 2.3(2) applied to (e2, f2) that f2g = -1f2 = f2. Hence, to show that g is scalar it suffices to show that vg = v for either v = e1 or v = f1, and for whichever of v  {ea, fa, x, y} is defined. We shall use (2.6) implicitly.
If d is odd, then Lemma 2.2(3) with T = V3 and initially with u = e1 + e3 + f3 and s = x, gives ug = u, and so e1g = e1 and hence f1g = f1. Now, setting u = e2 + f1 + x and s = e1 shows that ug = u. Hence xg = x, and so g is scalar.
If  = + then Lemma 2.2(3) applied to T = V4, u = e3 + f1 + f3 and s = fa  X shows that ug = u. Hence f1g = f1 and so e1g = e1. Next, letting s = f1 shows that fag = fa. Finally, Lemma 2.3(2) applied to fa, ea  X proves that g is scalar.
Finally, if  = - then X = x, y . Lemma 2.2(2), applied to T = V5 with s = f3 yields (e1 - e3 + x)g = (e1 -e3 +x), and applied again with s = e3 shows that (f1 +f3 +y)g = (f1 +f3 +y). Hence g = Id.
2.3. Symplectic groups on the cosets of orthogonal groups. We consider Spd(q), acting on the cosets of GO±d (q), with q even.
Proposition 2.12. Let G = Sp2m(q) with 2m  6 and q even, and let M = GO±2m(q). Then b(G, M \G) = 2m.
Proof. We shall use the isomorphism Sp2m(q) = GO2m+1(q) to consider the equivalent actions of H = GO2m+1(q) on N ±(H, 2m), where the natural module for H is V = F2qm+1 with quadratic form Q as in Definition 2.1. That is, we shall consider the actions of H on non-degenerate 2m-dimensional subspaces of + and - type, since the point stabiliser of H in these actions is GO±2m(q).
We shall first show that the set B in Table 6 is a base for H, and then show that B is of minimal size. First notice that (ei, fi), (ei, ei + fi + x), and (ei + fi + x, fi) are hyperbolic pairs, therefore Ai, ei, fi + x and ei + x, fi are 2-spaces of + type. The basis of Bi is an elliptic pair, so in each case B  .
Let g  H(B). Then we shall show that g = 1. From Q(x) = 1 and x = Rad(V ) = V  V , we deduce that xg = x. We first consider N -(H, 2m). For 2  i  m, the element g stabilises
T  Ui = B1  A2  · · ·  Ai-1  ei  Ai+1  · · ·  Am,
and so stabilises Rad(T  Ui) = ei . Hence there exists i  Fq such that eig = iei, for 2  i  m. Similarly, Rad(T  Vi)g = Rad(T  Vi) so fig = -i 1fi, for 2  i  m - 1. Since m  3, the space S := A2, . . . , Am-1 is non-degenerate and stabilised by g, so g also stabilises
S  W1 = A1, Am, x  W1 = A1, Am .
Hence g stabilises A1, Am W2 = e1, Am , and so fixes the radical of this space, which is e1 . Moreover, g stabilises e1, Am  T = Am = em, fm . Hence, since emg = mem, Lemma 2.3(2) shows that fmg = -m1fm. In addition, g stabilises Am  A1, Am = A1, and Lemma 2.3(2) now yields f1g = -1 1f1. Next, for 2  i  m we deduce from (fi + x)g = -i 1fi + x  Ui that i = 1, and the same follows for 1 from (f1 + x)g  W2.
The arguments for N +(H, 2m) are very similar but easier. Consideration of T  Ui shows that for all i there exists an i  Fq such that eig = iei. Then an identical argument applied to T  Vj shows that

11

fig = -i 1fi for i  m - 1. Therefore, g stabilises A1, . . . , Am-1   T = em, fm , and so fmg = -m1fm, also. Finally, notice that (fi + x)g = -i 1fi + x  Ui for all i, and hence i = 1, as required.
It remains only to show that these bases are of minimal size. Let A := {T, S1, . . . , S2m-2} be a set of 2m - 1 non-degenerate 2m-spaces of V of sign  (either + or -). We shall show that H(A) = 1. The stabiliser in H of T is HT = GO2m(q), which acts naturally on T as GO2m(q). It suffices to show that the stabiliser in HT of all of the spaces T  Si for 1  i  2m - 2 is nontrivial.
Since dim(T  Si) = 2m - 1, the restriction of B to T  Si is degenerate, and so T  Si has a onedimensional radical vi . Hence the 2-point stabiliser HT,Si stabilises vi  T . Furthermore, since T is non-degenerate, it follows that dim(vi  T ) = 2m - 1, and so T  Si = T  vi. Hence HT,Si is equal to HT, vi and so H(B) = 2i=m1-2HT,Si contains (HT ) v1 ,..., v2m-2 . This group is nontrivial by Lemma 2.9.
3. Proof of Theorem 1 for almost simple groups

In this section, we shall prove the following theorem, which in particular implies Theorem 1 for almost simple groups.
Theorem 3.1. Let G  Sym() be a primitive almost simple group of degree n that is not large base. If b(G) > log n + 1, then G = M24, n = 24 and b(G) = 7. Furthermore, if b(G)  log n + 1 then (G, n, b(G))  {(M12, 12, 5), (M23, 23, 6), (M24, 24, 7)} or G = PSp2m(2) with m  3, n = 22m - 2m-1 and b(G) = 2m = log n + 1.

We shall first consider the standard actions of Alt() and Sym() on partitions, then the actions of the
classical groups on totally singular and non-degenerate k-spaces, and (for the orthogonal groups in even characteristic) non-singular 1-spaces. Then we shall look at the action of groups with socle PSpd(2f ) on the cosets of the normaliser of GO±d (2f ), before considering the remaining subspace actions. Finally, we will deal with the non-standard actions, and hence prove Theorem 3.1.

3.1. Action on partitions. We first consider the non-large-base standard actions of Alt() and Sym().

Theorem 3.2. Let s  2 and t  2, with  := st  5, and let G be Sym(). Let  be the set of partitions of {1, 2, . . . , } into s subsets of size t, and let n = ||. Then b := b(G, ) < log n + 1.

Proof.

so again

b < log n.

For the remaining cases, by [1, Theorem 4(ii)]

(3.1)

b  logs t + 3  logs t + 4 = logs(/s) + 4 = logs  + 3.

Next consider s = 2, so that t  3. We check in Magma [3] that if t = 3, 4, 5 then b is at most 4, 5, and 5, respectively, whilst n = 10, 35, 126, and so b < log n + 1 in each case. Assume therefore that   12. Then

In particular, since   12, we deduce from (3.1) that

Next, let s = 3. We may assume that t > s, so   12. Then, reasoning as for s = 2, we deduce that

We are therefore left with 4  s < t, so that   20. For all , the groups Alt() and Sym() have no

3.2. Subspace actions. We now prove Theorem 3.1 for the subspace actions of almost simple groups. First we record two lemmas concerning base size and automorphism groups.

Lemma 3.3. Let G be a finite almost simple primitive permutation group on  with socle G0 a nonabelian simple classical group, and let G0  G1  G  . If G/G1 has a subnormal series of length s with all quotients cyclic, then b(G)  b(G1) + s.
Proof. If (G0, ) is not isomorphic to (Alt(), {1, . . . , }) with   {5, 6, 8}, then by [17, Theorem 1.2] each element of G has a regular cycle. It follows that stabilising one point for each cyclic quotient suffices to extend a base for G1 to one for G.
Let (G0, ) be (Alt(), {1, . . . , }) for some   {5, 6, 8}. Then G  Sym(), since the other automorphisms of Alt(6) do not act on 6 points, and so the result follows from b(Sym(), ) = b(Alt(), ) + 1.
Recall the meaning of S(G, k) and N (G, k) from Notation 1.3. The following bounds are established in [18, Proof of Theorem 3.3].

Lemma 3.4. Let G0 be a simple classical group.
(i) If (G0, k) = (P+2m(q), m) then b(G0, S(G, k))  d/k + 10. (ii) b(G0, N (G, k))  d/k + 11. (iii) If G0 = PSLd(q) then b(G0, S(G, k))  d/k + 5.

Lemma 3.5. G0 = P-4 (q)

Let G be almost for q  3. Let 

simple with = N (G, 1),

socle with

G0 =

one of P-4 (q), P5(q) +, - or blank, and let n

or =

P±6 (q). Assume that ||. Then b := b(G) <

log n + 1.

Proof. First let d = 4, so that q  4. Then Aut(G0)/ PGO-4 (q) has a normal series of length at most

2 with all quotients cyclic, so Lemmas 2.8 and 3.3 imply that b  5. From [6, Table 4.1.2] we see that

n

=

q (q 2 +1) (q-1,2)

>

26,

so

the

result

follows.

Next let d = 5, so that q is odd. Then Aut(G0)/ PGO5(q) is cyclic, so Lemmas 2.8 and 3.3 yield b  6,

whilst

from

[6,

Table

4.1.2]

we

see

that

n

=

q 2 (q 4 -1) 2(q2 1)



36

>

25,

so

the

result

follows.

Finally, let d = 6. From Lemmas 2.8 and 3.3 we deduce that b  5 if q = 2, and b  7 otherwise.

Moreover, by [6, Table 4.1.2],

n



q2(q3 + 1) (q - 1, 2)

if q = 2 if q  3

as required.

Proposition 3.6. Let d  8 be even, and let G be almost simple with socle G0 = Pd(q). Let  be S(G, k) or N (G, k), where  = +, - or blank, and let n = ||. If G acts primitively on  then b := b(G) < log n + 1.

Proof. We shall use throughout the proof the fact that if G0 = P+8 (q), or if  = S(G, 2) (see, for example, [4, Table 8.50]), then G/G0 has a normal series with all quotients cyclic of length at most three, and less

if q = 2 or q is prime, so that b(G)  b(G0) + 3, by Lemma 3.3. Furthermore, under the same conditions,

b(G)  b(PGOd(q)) whilst if p = 2 then

+ 2, by the same lemma. Out(G0) = Sym(3) × Cf

If .

G0

=

P+8 (pf )

and

p

is

odd

then

Out(G0)

=

Sym(4) × Cf ,

First consider  = S(G, k). By [19, Tables 3.5E and F] we may assume that 1  k  d/2, and

k  d/2 - 1 if  = -. If k  d/2 - 1 then by [6, Table 4.1.2, Cases VI and VII]

If k = 1 then Lemma 2.4 shows that b  d+1, with tighter bounds when q  3, whilst (3.3) gives n > qd-2, so log n + 1 > (d - 2) log q + 1  b. Similarly, if k = 2 then we deduce from Lemma 2.6 that b  d/2 + 3 if q is even or prime, and b  d/2 + 5 in general. From (3.3), we see that log n + 1 > (d - 1) log q + 1, so
the result follows. Next we consider the case 3  k  d/2 - 1, so that b(G0, )  d/k + 10 by Lemma 3.4(i). First assume
that q  3 and k = 3. We calculate in Magma that if (d, q) = (8, 2) then b  4. For (d, q) = (8, 3) we use the exact value of n and the fact that b(G)  b(G0) + 2 to see that log n + 1 > 15  b. For d  10 we see from (3.2) that

q10. It is shown in [18] that b(G0)  9, so b  10 when q = 2, and b  12 otherwise, and the result follows.

We now consider  = N (G, k), with   {+, -} or blank. The stabiliser of an element of  also stabilises a non-degenerate d - k space, of the opposite sign if  = - and k is even, and of the same sign otherwise. Thus by considering the stabiliser of spaces of type +, - and , we may assume that k  d/2.
First assume that k is even, so that 2  k  d/2, and if k = d/2 then  = -, by our assumption that G acts primitively. Then we deduce from [6, Table 4.1.2, Cases X, XI, XIII] (by replacing d by d - k if  = + and  = -) that

The quadratic kd- k2 - 1 attains its minimum for 4  k  d/2 at k = 4, so log n + 1 > (4d- 17) log q - 1

it

only

remains

to consider (d, k, ) = (8, 4, -). In this case, (4d - 17) log q - 1  15 log q + 1 and the result follows easily

for q  3. If q = 2 then Out(G0) is cyclic, hence by Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4(ii), b  14 and the result follows. Now let k be odd, so without loss of generality 1  k < d/2. By [6, Table 4.1.2, Cases IX, XII, XIV]

Proposition 3.7. Let d  7 and let G be almost simple with socle G0 = Pd(q). Let  be S(G, k) or N ±(G, k), and let n = ||. If G acts primitively on  then b := b(G) < log n + 1.

M. MOSCATIELLO AND COLVA M. RONEY-DOUGAL

Proof. We shall use throughout the proof the fact that Out(G0) has a normal series with at most two cyclic quotients, and Aut(G0)/ PGOd(q) is cyclic, so b  b(G0, ) + 2 and b  b(PGOd(q), ) + 1, by Lemma 3.3.
First let  = S(G, k). Then 1  k  (d - 1)/2 and by [6, Table 4.1.2, Case VII]

If k = 1 then n > qd-2  3d-2, and from Lemma 2.4 we deduce that b  d + 1, as required. If k = 2 then

n  qd, whilst Lemmas 2.6 give b  d/2 + 1. If 3  k  (d - 3)/2 then d  9 and n  qd+3. Hence

log n + 1  (d + 3) log q + 1  3d/2 + 11/2  d/3 + 12  b, by Lemma 3.4(i).

Finally, assume that k = (d - 1)/2, so that (3.5) simplifies to n =

For

4  k  d-3, the quadratic -k2+kd attains its minimum at k = d-3, so log n+1  (3d-9) log q-1. Now,

Lemma 3.4(ii) yields b  d/4 + 13, which is less than (3d + 13)/2  d log q + (2d - 9) log q - 1 = log n + 1,

so the proof is complete.

Proposition 3.8. Let d  4, and let G be almost simple with socle G0 = PSpd(q), with (d, q) = (4, 2). Let  be S(G, k) or N (G, k), and let n = ||. If G acts primitively on , then b := b(G) < log n + 1.

Proof. We shall use throughout the proof the fact that Out(G0) has a normal series with at most two cyclic quotients, so b(G, )  b(G0, ) + 2, with b(G, )  b(G0, ) + 1 if q > 2 is even or prime, by Lemma 3.3.
First let  = S(G, k). Then 1  k  d/2, and by [6, Table 4.1.2]

If k = 1 then n = (qd - 1)/(q - 1) > qd-1. By Lemma 2.4, b  d + 2, with b  d if q = 2 and b  d + 1 if

q = 3. The result now follows from a straightforward calculation, since d  4.

If k = 2 and d  6 then b  d, by Lemma 2.6, whilst log n + 1 > (2d - 5) + 1  b. If k = 2 and d = 4

then Lemma 2.6 implies that b(G0, )  4 and a routine calculation shows that b < log n + 1.

If k  3 then Lemma 3.4(i) yields b

with

First suppose that

d - 2k  2, so that d  8. If (d, q) = (8, 2) then we verify the result in Magma. Otherwise, we

notice that n > |S(PGO±d (q), k)|, and our upper bounds on b are less than the corresponding bounds for the orthogonal groups, so the result follows by the same calculations as in the proof of Proposition 3.6.

We

may

therefore

assume

that

k

so

that

so

if

then

the

result

is

immediate.

For

d = 6 and q  4, a Magma

calculation establishes the result, whilst if q  5 then log n + 1 > 14  b. For d = 8, if q = 2 then

log n + 1 > 12  b, whilst for q  3 we deduce that log n + 1 > 16 > b.

Next let  = N (G, k). Then k is even and without loss of generality k  d/2 - 1. By [6, Table 4.1.2]

If k = 2 then d  6 so log n + 1  ((d - 2) + (d - 2)) log q + 1 > d  b, by Lemma 2.10. If k  4

then

from

i2=1(q2i - 1). Putting these together shows that n  q12(qd - 1)q2 > qd+13,

so the result follows from Lemma 3.4(ii).

Proposition 3.9. Let d  3, let G be almost simple with socle G0 = PSUd(q), let  be S(G, k) or N (G, k), and let n = ||. Then b := b(G) < log n + 1.

Proof. We shall use throughout the proof the facts that Aut(G0)/ PGUd(q) is cyclic, whilst Out(G0) has a normal series with two cyclic quotients, so b(G, )  b(PGUd(q), ) + 1 and b(G, )  b(G0, ) + 2, by Lemma 3.3.
First let  = S(G, k). Then by [6, Table 4.1.2]

so n > qd if k = 1, n > q2d-4 if k = 2, and

If k = 1 then b  d+ 1  log n + 1 by Lemma 2.4, so let k = 2. If (d, q) = (4, 2) then a Magma calculation

shows the result, and otherwise if d = 4 then b  6  4 log q + 1 < log n + 1, by Lemma 2.6, as required.

If d  5 then b  d < log n + 1 by Lemma 2.6.

Finally, let k  3, so that d  6. For (d, q)  {(6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 2), (7, 3)} we verify the result

computationally.

Otherwise,

Similarly,

which covers all the remaining cases.

Now let  = N (G, k). Then by [6, Table 4.1.2]

qk(d-k) n=

di=d-k+1(qi - (-1)i ki=1(qi - (-1)i)

.

If k  2 then n > qd, and the result follows easily from Lemma 2.7 and Lemma 2.10. For k  3,

we get

ki=1(qi - (-1)i), because d  2k + 1  7. Hence n

Proposition 3.10. Let d  2 and when d = 2, let q  7. Let G be almost simple with socle G0 = PSLd(q), let  = S(G, k), and let n = ||. Then b := b(G) < log n + 1.

Proof. The group Out(G0) has a normal series with all quotients cyclic of length at most three, and G/G0 has such a series with length at most two if k = d/2, or if d = 2, or if q is prime; and is cyclic if more
than one of these conditions hold. Hence by Lemma 3.3, b  b(G0, ) + , where  = 3 in general, but with smaller values of  for the special cases above.

First let k = 1, so that n = (qd - 1)/(q - 1) > qd-1, whilst b  d + 2 by Lemma 2.2, with smaller bounds if q  3. The result follows from a lengthy but straightforward calculation, using n = q + 1  8
when d = 2. If k = 2 then n > q2d-4. If d = 4 and q  3 then a Magma calculation shows that b  5 < log n, and
if d = 4 and q > 3 then b  5 + 2 < log n, by Lemma 2.5. If d > 4 then b  d/2 + 3 < log n + 1 by
Lemma 2.5. Assume finally that d/2  k  3, so that d  6, and

Then from Lemma 3.4(iii), we deduce that b  d/3 + 8  d + 4  log n + 1.

We now meet the unique infinite family of examples that attains the upper bound in Theorem 1.

Proposition 3.11. Let q = 2f , let d = 2m  4, and let G be almost simple with socle G0 = Spd(q). Assume that (d, q) = (4, 2). Let M = NG(GOd(q)), let  = M \ G, let n = ||, and let b = b(G).
If  = - and q = 2 then log n + 1 < b = log n + 1. Otherwise, b < log n + 1.

Proof. We calculate that n = | Spd(q) : GOd(q)| = qm(qm +)/2. If q = 2 then b = 2m by Proposition 2.12. If  = + then n > 22m-1, hence log n + 1 > b. If  = - then log n + 1 = 2m = b.
It is proved in [18] that b(G0, )  2m + 1, so b  2m + 2 by Lemma 3.3 since Out(G0) is cyclic. Therefore if q  4 then
log n + 1 > log(q2m-1/2) + 1 = (2m - 1) log q  4m - 2  b,

and the proof is complete.

Our final result in this subsection deals with all of the remaining subspace actions.

Proposition 3.12. Let G be an almost simple classical group, with a primitive subspace action on a set  of size n, with point stabiliser H. Assume that  is not a G-orbit of totally singular, non-degenerate, or non-singular subspaces, and that if G0 = soc(G) = Sp2m(2f ) then (G0  H) = GO±2m(2f ). Then b := b(G) < log n + 1.

Proof. Definition 1.1 implies that G is not simple, and H is a novelty maximal subgroup of G. Consulting

[19] and [4], we see that one of the following holds:

(i) G0 = PSLd(q), d  3 and G  PLd(q);

(ii) G0 = PSp4(q), q even and G  PCSp4(q); (iii) G0 = P+8 (q) and G  PCO+8 (q) (in the notation of [4, Table 1.2]).

In particular, from [4], in each case there exists a group G1 such that G0  G1  G, the quotient G/G1 has

a normal series of length at most two with all quotients cyclic, and H  G1 is a subgroup of the stabilizer

Finally, notice that n  4|1| by the Orbit-Stabiliser Theorem, so if b1 < log |1| + 1 = log 2|1| 

log n - 1, then b < log n + 1. The result is now immediate from Propositions 3.10, 3.8 and 3.6.

3.3. Proof of Theorem 3.1.

Proof of Theorem 3.1. Let G0 = soc(G). The only non-large-base almost simple primitive groups of degree n  8 are the actions of Alt(5) and Sym(5) on 6 points, of PSL3(2) on 7 points, and of PSL2(7)

and PGL2(7) on 8 points, all of which have base size 3, which is less than log n + 1. Hence the result holds for n  8, and therefore for b(G)  4.

to many other simple groups, degree at most 6 or are large

we shall base, so

consider them next. If let G0 be PSL2(q) for

q  7, and let H = G, for some   . We work through the choices for H, as described in [4, Table

8.1]. The result for H  C1 follows from Proposition 3.10. Burness shows in [5, Table 3] that b(G)  3

17

for the majority of the remaining choices of H. More precisely, he shows that b(G)  3 if H  C2  C3,

or if H  C5 and q = q0r with r = 2, or if H  C6 and q > 7; or if H  C9 and q = 9. We therefore need

consider only equivalent to

the exceptions with q  7. If H  C5 and q = q02, then that of P-4 (q0) on non-degenerate 1-spaces. If q0 = 3

q0  then

3 and G0 =

the action of G0 on  Alt(6), and the action

is is

equivalent to the (large base) action on 2-sets. Hence we can assume that q0  4, and the result follows

 C6 and q = proof we shall

7, or H assume

q = 9, then PSL2(q).

so

the

result

follows.

Next, assume that the action of G is not standard. Burness, Guralnick and Saxl show in [7] that if G0 = Alt(n) then b(G)  3. For classical groups G, Burness shows in [5, Theorem 1.1] that either n = 1408 and b(G) = 5 or b(G)  4. For the exceptional groups G, it is shown by Burness, Liebeck

and Shalev in [9], that b(G)  6; since the smallest degree of a faithful primitive representation of an

exceptional group is 65 (see, for example, [14, Table B.2]), the result follows. Finally, Burness, O'Brien

and Wilson show in [10] that if G is sporadic, then either b(G)  5, or G is M23, M24, Co3, Co2, or Fi22.2, with a specified action. If log n + 1  5, then n  16, and the only sporadic group with a faithful primitive

action on at most 16 points, other than M12 as given in the statement, is M11 on 11 or 12 points, with

base size 4. The actions of M23 and M24 are given in the theorem statement, whilst the remaining actions have base size 6 and very large degree.

It remains to consider the standard actions that are not large base. If G0 = Alt(), then  is an orbit of partitions of {1, . . . , }, so b(G)  log n + 1 by Theorem 3.2. Hence we may assume that G is a classical

group in a subspace action.

If G0 = PSLd(q) then the result follows from Propositions 3.10 and 3.12. If G0 = PSUd(q) then we

may assume that d  3, and the result follows from Propositins 3.9 and 3.12.

If G0 = PSpd(q) then we may assume that d  4, and (d, q) = (4, 2), since PSp4(2) = PSL2(9). If the

action is on k-spaces then the result follows from Proposition 3.8; if q is even and the point stabiliser is

GO±d (q), If G0

then it follows from = Pd(q) then our

Proposition assumption

3.11; and otherwise it follows from Proposition 3.12. that G0 = PSL2(q) implies that d  5, so assume

first

that

d  {5, 6}, and let H0 be whichever of PSp4(q), PSL4(q) or PSU4(q) is isomorphic to G0. If the action

is on totally singular subspaces, then the action of G0 is equivalent to that of H0 on totally singular

subspaces. If the action is on non-degenerate 2-spaces, then the action of G0 is equivalent to that of

H0 on the maximal subgroups in Class C2 or C3, and b(G)  3 by [5, Table 3]. If the action is on an

orbit of non-degenerate 1-spaces, then the result follows from Lemma 3.5, and otherwise it follows from

Proposition 3.12. Hence we may assume that d  7, and the result follows from Propositions 3.6, 3.7 and

3.12.

4. Proof of Theorem 1

In this section, we prove Theorem 1.

Proposition 4.1. Let G  Sym() be a primitive group of diagonal type and degree n. Then b := b(G)  max{4, log log n}. In particular, b < log n.

Proof. Let soc(G) = T k, where T is a non-abelian simple group and k  2. Then n = |T |k-1 and we may assume that G = T k.(Out(T ) × Sym(k)). For the final claim, notice that n  60, so log n > 4, and so it
suffices to prove the first claim. If k = 2 then b  4, as proved by Fawcett in [15]. It is also proved in [15] that if k  3 then

(4.1)

If 3  k  |T | then b  3 and the result follows, so assume that k > 60. Then n  6060, so log log n > 8,

Proposition 4.2. Let G  Sym() be a primitive group of product action type and degree n. If G is not large base then b := b(G) < log n + 1.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that G = H  Sym(k), where H  Sym() is primitive, and either H is almost simple and not large base or H is of diagonal type. Let || = m, so n = mk. Let {1, . . . , c}   be a base of minimal size for the action of H on , and let i := (i, . . . , i)  k =  for 1  i  c. It is shown in the proof of [11, Proposition 3.2] that there exists a set of log k 2partitions of {1, . . . , k} such that the intersection in Sym(k) of the stabilizers of these partitions is trivial. Let a = log k and r = log m . Then, as in the proof of [11, Lemma 3.8], there exists a subset {1, . . . , a/r} of  with the property that an element g  G which factorizes as g = (1, . . . , 1), where 1  H and   Sym(k), fixes each i if and only if  = 1. Hence, as noted in [11, Equation (13)], the set
B := {1, . . . , a/r}  {1, . . . , c}
is a base for G. In particular, we deduce that

From Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 4.1, we see that either b(H, )  log m + 1  log m + 2, or

(H, m, b(H, )) = (M24, 24, 7). In this lattter case

For the general case, assume first that k  4, so that in particular log k  log m. Then by (4.2)

b  1 + b(H, )  log m + 3 < 2 log m + 1  k log m + 1 = log n + 1.

If instead k  5, then

as required.

Finally, we state and prove a slightly more detailed version of Theorem 1.

Theorem 4.3. Let G be a primitive subgroup of Sym() with || = n. Assume that G is not large base. Then b := b(G)  log n + 1 if and only if G is one of the following.
(i) A subgroup of AGLd(2), with b = d + 1 = log n + 1. (ii) The group Spd(2), acting on the cosets of GO-d (2) with d  4, for which log n+1 < b = log n+1. (iii) A Mathieu group Mn in its natural permutation representation with n  {12, 23, 24}. If n = 12 or
23 then b = log n + 1, while if n = 24 then b = 7 > log n + 1.

Proof. We work through the cases of the O'Nan-Scott Theorem. If G is of affine type, then without loss of generality G = AGLd(p) with n = pd, and the point stabiliser
of G is GLd(p), acting naturally on the set  = Fdp. Let B be a base of minimal size for GLd(p) on . Then B is a basis for Fdq, so b = |B| + 1 = d + 1 as required.
If G is of twisted wreath product type, then by [23, Section 3.6] the group G is a subgroup of a
primitive product action group H  P  Sym(), with H of diagonal type. Hence the result follows from
Proposition 4.2.
If G is almost simple, or of diagonal type, or of product action type, then the result follows from
Theorem 3.1, Proposition 4.1 or Proposition 4.2, respectively.

We conclude with a question.

Question 1. Which primitive groups G  Sym(n) satisfy b(G) = log n + 1?

Notice that such a G must be a subgroup of AGLd(2) for some d, and that if d is even then groups such as 2d : Sp(d, 2) have this property.
