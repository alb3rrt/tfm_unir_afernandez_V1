## Abstract

We present here a novel cantilever based apparatus to perform translational stress or strain controlled rheology in very soft solids, and obtain simultaneous confocal imaging of the 3 dimensional microstructure. The stress is measured using eddy based sensors. Both the stress and strain are controlled by applying PID control loops on measured quantities and changing position using a micromanipulator. To get rid of surface tension forces, the sample and cantilever are immersed. This enables stress measurement and control down to 3mPa. With this apparatus, we can independently apply shear and normal stress, or strain, with same precision. We demonstrate the technical capability of the setup with steady shear strain or stress experiments on a soft protein gel system. The simultaneous confocal imaging offers insight into the macroscopic breaking observed in an increasing shear strain experiment.
