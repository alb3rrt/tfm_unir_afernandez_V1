UPPER BOUNDS FOR FRACTIONAL JOINT MOMENTS OF THE RIEMANN ZETA FUNCTION
MICHAEL J. CURRAN

arXiv:2106.00165v1 [math.NT] 1 Jun 2021

ABSTRACT. We establish upper bounds for the joint moments of the 2kth power of the Riemann zeta function with the 2hth power of its derivative for 0  h  1 and 1  k  2. These bounds are
expected to be sharp based upon predictions from random matrix theory.

1. INTRODUCTION

In the past two decades, conjectural connections between the zeros of the Riemann zeta function (s) and eigenvalues of random unitary matrices have led to many interesting developments in understanding the moments of the zeta function. In the recent random matrix theory literature, there has been a fair bit of interest in understanding the joint moments of the characteristic polynomial of a random unitary matrix with its derivative. In this paper, the primary objects are the joint moments of (s), given by

as well as the joint moments of the Hardy Z function

that

|Z (t)|

and

that Z(t)

is

R.

The

work

of

Keating and Snaith [22, 23], Hughes [20], and Hall [19] has led to the conjecture that whenever

IT (k, h)  C(k, h)T (log T )k2+2h, JT (h, k)  CZ(k, h)T (log T )k2+2h

(1)

for a certain constants C(k, h), CZ(k, h) as T  . There are conjectured values for the constants CZ(k, h) for general real h, k, but values for C(k, h) are only conjectured for integral h, k. In both cases, the constants split as a product of an arithmetic factor and a random matrix factor. The
arithmetic factor is a well understood product over primes. The random matrix factor has many
different expressions including combinatorial sums [13, 14, 20], a multiple contour integral in the case h = k [12], and a determinant of Bessel functions [2, 12]. For h, k not necessarily equal, the random matrix factor can be solved for finite N and is related to the solution of a Painleve´ V type differential equation [4]. Furthermore, the limit as N   is related to the solution of a certain Painleve´ III equation [1, 2, 4, 15].
Previously the asymptotics (1) were known for h, k  {0, 1, 2} with h  k due to Ingham [16] and Conrey [8], and upper bounds of the right order were only known for half integer valued
1

h, k  2 due to work of Conrey [8] and Conrey Ghosh [11]. The aim of this paper is to establish upper bounds for IT (k, h) and JT (k, h) of the right order in a larger range of h and k.

Theorem 1. Let 1  k  2 and 0  h  1. Then for large T

IT (k, h)  T (log T )k2+2h, and the same bound holds for JT (k, h).

The proof we give is based on the work of Heap, Radziwill and Soundararajan [18] which in

turn is based on the method introduced in Radziwill and Soundararajan [26]. The general principle

in these works is that if one can compute the 2kth moment of a given L-function twisted by an

arbitrary Dirichlet polynomial then one can find upper bounds of the right order for all of its lower

order moments. In particular, this approach is used to prove Theorem 1 in the case h = 0. We

combine the ideas of the paper [18] with twisted joint moment calculations to deduce Theorem 1

in the case of h = 1 and then deduce the result from Ho¨lder's inequality­ the bounds we obtain

are of the right order since the exponent of log T in (1) is linear in h. We are forced to take

k  [1, 2] because 2k - 2h is only nonnegative when k  1 at the boundary case h = 1. It is

likely

that

one

could

establish

sharp

bounds

on

IT (k, h)

JT (k, h)

2. OUTLINE OF THE PROOF

We will deduce Theorem 1 from the following.

Proposition 1. Let T be large and 1  k  2. Then

(

1 2

+

(

1 2

T

and

the

same

bound

holds

when



(

1 2

+

it)

is

replaced

by

Z (t).

Proof of Theorem 1. Recall theorem 1 of [18] gives for 0  k  2

by

and

The

case

of

the

joint

moments

of

Z (t)

is

similar

since

|Z (t)|

=

|

(

1 2

+

it)|.

To prove Proposition 1, we will approximate the logarithm of (s) by a truncated sum over primes pX p-s. Following the works [17, 25, 27], we will break up this sum into increments which have
progressively smaller variance. This in turn allows us to work with a Dirichlet polynomial of length

2

T  for some small but fixed  > 0, which is long enough to give a good enough approximation of

 (s).

We follow the notation introduced in [18]. Denote by logj the j-fold iterated logarithm, and take  to be the largest integer so that log T  104. Now define a sequence Tj for 1  j   by T1 = e2 and

Tj = exp

log T (logj T )2

for 2  j  , and for 2  j   and s  C set

Pj(s) =

1 ps

,

Tj -1 p<Tj

and Pj =

1 p

.

Tj -1 p<Tj

The hope is then that on average log (s) will be controlled by the sum of the increments Pj(s), where Pj is the variance of the jth increment on the half line. By Merten's second estimate, note
that

Pj  2 logj T - 2 logj+1 T. Next define for 2  j   the truncated Taylor expansion

Nj(s; ) =

(n)g(n) ns

Tj -1 p<Tj

(n)500Pj

where g is the multiplicative function given by g(pm) = 1/m! on prime powers. So for most

t  [T, 2T ] we expect

2j

Nj

(

1 2

+

it; )

to

behave

similarly

to



(

1 2

+

it).

Now

each

Nj

is

a

Dirichlet polynomial of length at most Tj500Pj so

2j

Nj

(

1 2

+

it;

)

is

a

Dirichlet

polynomial

of length at most T 1/10, which is amenable to analysis.

We will deduce Proposition 1 in two steps. First we bound the integrand by a product of integral powers of  and  with short Dirichlet polynomials.

The same bound holds when (s) is replaced by Z(t).

The proof of Proposition 2 is almost identical to the proof of proposition 1 in [18], so it is omitted.

The

only

difference

is

that

one

uses

the

conjugate

exponents

p

and

q

,

and

then

one

multiplies the resulting inequality by |(s)|2 or |Z(t)|2. This reduces the proof of Proposition 1

to the calculation of two types of twisted moments.

We will derive estimates for general twisted joint moments of  in the following section, and then use these estimates to prove Propositions 3 and 4 in the final section. Before we undertake

this, let us see how these estimates imply Proposition 1.

where the final bound follows by the same reasoning as [18]. The conclusion for the Z function is the same.

3. TWISTED MOMENT FORMULAE
We will derive the necessary twisted joint moment formulae from formulae for twisted moments of (s) with small shifts off of the critical line. Fortunately there are many known formulae for computing twisted moments of  due to connections with the proportion of zeros of  lying on the critical line [7, 24]. Then following work of Young [28], we can differentiate these formulae with respect to the shifts to obtained the desired twisted joint moments. The formula in [28] is valid for Dirichlet polynomials of length T 1/2-, and we note that work of Bettin Chandee and Radziwill [6] provides asymptotics for the twisted second moment without shifts for any Dirichlet polynomial of length at most T 17/33-. The twisted fourth moment formula we use was first proven by Hughes and Young [21] for Dirichlet polynomials of length at most T 1/11-, which was later increased to T 1/4- by Bettin Bui Li and Radziwill [5].

Following these works, we will bound the desired twisted moments by introducing a smooth cutoff. Going forward, we fix a smooth  : R  R such that supp   [3/4, 9/4] and (t) = 1 for all t  [0, 1].

4. PROOF OF PROPOSITIONS 3 AND 4

The proofs of Propositions 3 and 4 are straightforward modifications of the proof of proposition 3 in [18]. In fact we will see Proposition 4 is an immediate consequence of Lemma 2 and a bound for G(z1, z2, z3, z4) proven in [18]. This will then conclude the proof of Theorem 1.

Proof of Proposition 3. We will apply Lemma 1 to the Dirichlet polynomials

(n)=(n)=r

In both cases, we will estimate

(m, n)z1+z2 mz1 nz2

which holds under the assumptions |zj|  9/ log T and m, n  T 1/10. First we handle (6). Using Rankin's trick, we may drop the condition (n), (n)  500Pj
incurring an error term of at most
