Abstract We use blow up analysis for local integral equations to provide a blow up rates of solutions of higher order Hardy-He´non equation in a bounded domain with an isolated singularity, and show the asymptotic radial symmetry of the solutions near the singularity. This work generalizes the correspondence results of Jin-Xiong [8] on higher order conformally invariant equations with an isolated singularity.

1 Introduction

This article aims to study the local behaviors of positive solutions for the higher order Hardy-

He´non equation

(-)u = |x| up in B1\{0},

(1)

where 1

is an integer,

In the special case of  = 1, the local behavior of the positive solutions for (1) with isolated

singularity

has

been

very

well

understood.

For

is obtained by a number of authors, where u denotes the gradient of u and C stands for the different positive constants. For more precise estimates and details, we refer the interested reader to [1, 2, 6, 9, 16, 17, 18, 21]. In the classical paper [3], Caffarelli-Gidas-Spruck established the asymptotic behavior for local positive solutions of (1),

u(x) = u¯(|x|)(1 + O(|x|)) as x  0,

where

p



n+2 n-2

and

u¯(|x|)

:=

-Sn

u(|x|)d

is

the

average

of

u.

Li

[10]

improved

their

results

for

and

simplified

the

proofs.

For

the

fractional

1

case 0 <  < 1, Caffarelli-Jin-Sire-Xiong [4] studied the sharp blow up rate, asymptotically radially symmetric and removability of the positive solution for the fractional Yamabe equation with an isolated singularity

(-) u

=

n+2
u n-2

in B1\{0}.

Motivated by the work of the above, we have studied the fractional Hardy-He´non equations in our previous work [15], and not only derived that there exists a positive constant C such that the blow up rates

u(x)



C

|x|-

2+ p-1

|u(x)|



C

|x|-

2+ +p-1 p-1

near x = 0,

for

,

but

also

obtained

the

asymptotically

radially

symmetric

u(x) = u¯(|x|)(1 + O(|x|)) as x  0,

for

-2

<





0,

n+ n-2

<

p



n+2+2 n-2

,

which

is

consistent

with

the

classic

case



=

1.

Recently, by using blow up analysis Jin-Xiong [8] proved sharp blow up rates of the positive

solutions of higher order conformally invariant equations with an isolated singularity

(-) u

=

n+2
u n-2

in B1\{0},

where

1





<

n 2

is

an

integer,

and

showed

the

asymptotic

radial

symmetry

of

the

solutions

near the singularity. In detail, they proved that there exists a positive constant C such that

u(x)



C |x|-

n-2 2

near x = 0,

and u(x) = u¯(|x|)(1 + O(|x|)) as x  0.

This is an extension of the celebrated theorem of Caffarelli-Gidas-Spruck [3] for the second

order Yamabe equation and Caffarelli-Jin-Sire-Xiong [4] for the fractional Yamabe equation

with isolated singularity to higher order equations.

Inspired by the above work, we are interested in the higher order Hardy-He´non equation

(1),

where

1





<

n 2

is

an

integer,

in

a bounded

domain

with

an

isolated

singularity

in this

paper. Our results provide a blow up rate estimate near the isolated singularity and show that

the solution of (1) is asymptotically radially symmetric near the isolated singularity, which is consistent with the case 0 <   1.

Theorem 1.1.

Suppose that 1 



<

n 2

is

an

integer,

and

u



C 2 (B1 \{0})



L

n n-2

(B1)

is

a

positive solution of (1).

(i)

If

-2

<

,

n+ n-2

<

p

<

n+2 n-2

and

(-)mu  0 in B1\{0}, m = 1, 2, · · · ,  - 1,

(2)

2

then there exists a positive constant C = C(n, , , p, ) such that

u(x)



C

|x|-

2+ p-1

,

|u(x)|



C

|x|-

2+ +p-1 p-1

near x = 0.

(ii)

If

-2

<





0,

n+ n-2

<

p



n+2+2 n-2

and

the

solution

satisfies

(2), then

u(x) = u¯(|x|)(1 + O(|x|)) as x  0,

where u¯(|x|) := -Sn u(|x|)d is the spherical average of u.

The main idea of our approach is to carry out blow up analysis to get the blow up rate estimate near the isolated singularity, and by the method of moving spheres to study the asymptotically radially symmetric as in Caffarelli-Jin-Sire-Xiong [4] for the fractional Yamabe equation 0 <  < 1. The method of moving spheres (see [11, 12, 13, 14]) has become a very powerful tool in the study of nonlinear elliptic equations, i.e. the method of moving planes together with the conformal invariance, which fully exploits the conformal invariance of the problem. It is known that one of the conformal invariance, i.e. the Kelvin transform of u defined as

ux,(y) :=

 |y - x|

n-2
u

x

+

2(y - x) |y - x|2

in Rn,

with  > 0 and x  Rn, plays an important part in our proof. However, in our local situation (1), the sign conditions (2) may change when performing the Kelvin transforms. Inspired by a unified
approach to solve the Nirenberg problem and its generalizations by the authors Jin-Li-Xiong in [7], we shall make use of integral representations. In details, we first prove |x| up  L1(B1) under the assumptions of Theorem 1.1, and then we can rewrite the differential equation (1) into
the integral equation involving the Riesz potential

u(x) =

B1

|y| |x -

up(y) y|n-2

dy

+

h(x)

in B1\{0},

where h  C1(B1) is a positive function. Thus, the sign conditions (2) will ensure the maximum principle and are essential for applying the moving spheres method. As a result, we just need to study the integral equation.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we shall show that (1) can be written as the form of (3), and then give some results about the integral equation, which implies that Theorem 1.1 follows from these results. In Section 3, we prove the upper bound near the isolated singularity for the solution of (3), and the asymptotic radial symmetry will be obtained in Section 4.

dy

h(x)

in B1\{0},

(3)

where h  C1(B1) is a positive function, otherwise we consider the equation in a smaller ball. About the integral equation (3), we shall first show some results, which will recover our previous

work [15] for the fractional Yamabe equation 0 <  < 1, and the proof will be given later in

Section 3 and Section 4. Now we first introduce the upper bound of the positive solution near

the singularity.

Theorem 2.1.

Suppose that 0

n+2 n-2

,

if

u  C(B1\{0}) is a positive solution of (3) and |x| up(x)  L1(B1), then there exists a

positive constant C = C(n, , , p) such that

One consequence of the upper bound of the solution near the singularity in Theorem 2.1 is the following Harnack inequality.

Corollary

Assume as

in

Theorem

then

for

then

there

exists

a

positive

constant C independent of r such that

The following theorem shows the asymptotic radial symmetry of the positive solution near the singularity.

if u  C(B1\{0}) is a positive solution of (3) and |x| up(x)  L1(B1), then

u(x) = u¯(|x|)(1 + O(|x|)) as x  0,

where u¯(|x|) := -Sn u(|x|)d is the spherical average of u.

2.1 Proof of Theorem 1.1

Next we shall show that we can rewrite the differential equation (1) into the integral equation

if

,

where  is the Gamma function, and h1 is smooth in Br and satisfies (-)h1 = 0 in Br. As a result, we can finish the proof of Theorem 1.1 by Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 2.3. For the

purpose, we first need the following proposition.

Proposition 2.4.

Suppose that 1





<

n 2

is an integer, 

>

-2, p

>

n+ n-2

,

and

u



C2(B1\{0}) is a positive solution of (1), then |x| up  L1(B1).

Proof. To do so, we take a smooth function  defined in R as the cut-off function with values in

[0, 1] satisfying

0, (t) :=
1,

if |t|  1, if |t|  2.

For

let

Since

we

conclude

that

|x| up < |x| up  C.

By sending   0, we obtain

|x| up  C.
B1
Thus, we obtain that |x| up  L1(B1) and complete the proof.

Furthermore, we also need to recall some known facts. Let G1(x, y) be the Green function of - on the unit ball, i.e.

G1(x, y)

=

(n

-

1 2)wn-1

|x - y|2-n -

x |x|

-

|x|y

2-n

for x, y  B1,

and define

G(x, y) :=

G1(x, y1)G1(y1, y2) · · · G1(y-1, y)dy1 · · · dy-1,

B1 ×···×B1

then we have

G(x, y) = B(n, )|x - y|2-n + A(x, y),

where A(·, ·) is smooth in B1 × B1. Let

H1(x, y)

:=

-

 y

G1

(x,

y)

=

1 - |x|2 wn-1|x - y|n

for x  B1, y  B1,

where wn-1 is the surface area of the unit sphere in Rn, then for 2  i  , define

Hi(x, y) :=

G1(x, y1)G1(y1, y2) · · · G1(yi-2, yi-1)H1(yi-1, y)dy1 · · · dyi-1.

B1 ×···×B1

Furthermore, for a function u  C2(B1)  C(B1), we have

u(x) = G1(x, y)(-u)(y)dy + H1(x, y)(-u)(y)dSy.

B1

B1

By induction, we have for 2 < n, u  C2(B1)  C2-2(B1), we have



u(x) = G(x, y)(-)u(y)dy +

Hi(x, y)(-)i-1u(y)dSy.

B1

i=1 B1

Now, we start our proof of Theorem 1.1 by using the above argument

Proof of Theorem 1.1. We can suppose that u  C2(B1\{0}) and u > 0 in B1, otherwise we just consider the equation in a smaller ball. By the above argument, we know that we only need to obtain (5), then we can finish the proof. To prove (5), let

m

v(x) := G(x, y)|y| up(y)dy +

Hi(x, y)(-)-iu(y)dSy,

B1

i=1 B1

and w := u - v.

6

Then

(-)w = 0 in B1\{0}.

By the generalized Bocher's Theorem [5] for polyharmonic function,

w(x) =

AD(|x|2-n) + g(x),

||2-1

where  = (1, 2, · · · , n) is multi-index, A are constants, and g(x) is a smooth solution of (-)g(x) = 0 in B1. If we can claim that A = 0 for ||  2 - 1, then w(x) is a classical polyharmonic function on B1, that is,

(-)w(x) = 0 in B1.

Moreover, since w = w = · · · = -1w = 0 on B1, w = 0 which implies that u = v.

Thus,

u(x) = B(n, )

Br

|y| |x -

up(y) y|n-2

+ h1(x),

where

h1(x) = A(x, y)|y| up(y)dy +

G(x, y)|y| up(y)dy

Br

B1 \Br



+

Hi(x, y)(-)i-1u(y)dSy.

i=1 B1

Since -u  0 in B1\{0}, and u > 0 in B1, we know from the Maximum Principle that

c1 := infB1 u = minB1 u > 0. By |y| up(y)  L1(B1) from Proposition 2.4, we can find that

r

<

1 4

such

that

for

x

Hence, by condition (2), we have for x  Br,

Hi(x, y)u(y)dSy
B1



-

c1 2

+

inf
B1

On the other hand, h1 is smooth in Br and satisfies (-)h1 = 0 in Br. Then we can finish the proof.

7

To do it, by contradiction, we may assume that there exists a multi-index 0  Rn satisfying |0|  2 - 1 such that A0 = 0. Thus, for large , we infer

|{x

|w(x)|

.

(6)

On the other hand, combining with |y| up(y)  L1(B1) and the fact that the Riesz potential

n

|y|2-n is weak type

1,

n n-2

, then we obtain that v  Lwn-ea2k (B1)  L1(B1). Moreover, for

every  > 0 we can choose  > 0 such that B2 |y| up(y)dy < , then for all sufficiently large

, we have

{x  B : |v(x)| > } 

x  B :

B2

G(x, y)|y| up(y)dy

which implies that

This is a contradiction with (6) provided that  is small enough. Up to now, we complete the proof.

3 The upper bound near the isolated singularity
In this section, we shall give proofs of Theorem 2.1 and Corollary 2.2 respectively. The following we start our proof.

8

3.1 Proof of Theorem 2.1
First, we recall the Doubling Property [19, Lemma 5.1] and denote BR(x) as the ball in Rn with radius R and center x. For convenience, we write BR(0) as BR for short.
Proposition 3.1. Suppose that  = D    Rn,  is closed and  =  \ D. Let M : D  (0, ) be bounded on compact subset of D. If for a fixed positive constant k, there exists y  D satisfying
M (y)dist(y, ) > 2k,
then there exists x  D such that

M (x)  M (y), M (x)dist(x, ) > 2k,

and for all z  D  BkM-1(x)(x),

M (z)  2M (x).

Next, in order to prove Theorem 2.1, we start with the following lemma.

Lemma

3.2.

Let

1

<

p

<

n+2 n-2

,

0

<





1

and

c(x)



C 2, (B1 )

satisfy

c C2,(B1)  C1, c(x)  C2 in B1

(7)

for some positive constants C1, C2. Suppose that h  C1(B1) and u  C2(B1) is a nonnega-

tive solution of

u(x) =

B1

c(y)up(y) |x - y|n-2

dy

+

h(x)

in B1,

(8)

then there exists a positive constant C depending only on n, , p, C1, C2 such that

p-1
|u(x)| 2

p-1
+ |u(x)| p+2-1



C[dist(x, B1)]-1

in B1.

Proof. Arguing by contradiction, we assume that for k = 1, 2, · · · , there exist nonnegative functions uk satisfying (8) and points yk  B1 such that

p-1
|uk(yk)| 2

p-1
+ |uk(yk)| p+2-1

>

2k[dist(yk, B1)]-1.

(9)

Define

p-1

p-1

Mk(x) := |uk(x)| 2 + |uk(x)| p+2-1 .

Via Proposition 3.1, for D = B1,  = B1, there exists xk  B1 such that

Mk(xk)  Mk(yk), Mk(xk) > 2k[dist(xk, B1)]-1  2k,

(10)

9

and for any z  B1 and |z - xk|  kMk-1(xk),

Mk(z)  2Mk(xk).

(11)

It follows from (10) that

k := Mk-1(xk)  0 as k  ,

(12)

dist(xk, B1) > 2kk,

for k = 1, 2, · · · .

(13)

Consider

2

2

wk(y) := kp-1 uk(xk + ky), vk(y) := kp-1 hk(xk + ky)

in Bk.

Combining (13), we obtain that for any y  Bk,

|xk

+

k y

-

xk |



k |y |



k k

<

1 2

dist(xk

,

B1),

that is,

xk

+

k y



B

1 2

dist(xk

,

B1

)(xk

)



B1.

Therefore, wk is well defined in Bk and

|wk

(y

)|

p-1 2

=

k |uk (xk

+

k

y)|

p-1 2

,

p-1

p-1

|wk(y)| 2+p-1 = k|uk(xk + ky)| 2+p-1 .

From (11), we find that for all y  Bk,

p-1

p-1

p-1

p-1

|uk(xk + ky)| 2 + |uk(xk + ky)| 2+p-1  2 |uk(xk)| 2 + |uk(xk)| p+2-1 .

That is,

p-1

p-1

|wk(y)| 2 + |wk(y)| 2+p-1  2kMk(xk) = 2.

(14)

Moreover, wk satisfies

wk(x) =

Bk

ck |x

(y )wkp (y ) - y|n-2

dy

+

vk(x)

in Bk,

(15)

and

|wk

(0)|

p-1 2

p-1
+ |wk(0)| 2+p-1

= 1,

where ck(y) := c(xk + ky). By (12) it follows that

vk C1(Bk)  0.

10

By condition (7), we obtain that {ck} is uniformly bounded in Rn. For each R > 0, and for all y, z  BR, we have

|Dck(y) - Dck(z)|  C1|k||k(y - z)|  C1|y - z|, || = 0, 1, · · · , 2

for k is large enough. Therefore, by Arzela-Ascoli's Theorem, there exists a function c  C2(Rn), after extracting a subsequence, ck  c in Cl2oc(Rn). Moreover, by (12), we obtain

|ck(y) - ck(z)|  0 as k  .

(16)

This implies that the function c actually is a constant C. By (7) again, ck  C2 > 0, we conclude that C is a positive constant.
On the other hand, applying the regularity results in Section 2.1 of [7], after passing to a subsequence, we have, for some nonnegative function w  Cl2o,c(Rn),
wk  w in Cloc(Rn)

for some  > 0. Moreover, w satisfies

w(x) =

Rn

C wp (y) |x - y|n-2

dy

in Rn

(17)

and

|w(0)|

p-1 2

p-1
+ |w(0)| 2+p-1

= 1.

Since

p

<

n+2 n-2

,

this

contradicts

the

Liouville-type

result

[20,

Theorem

1.4]

that

the

only

non-

negative entire solution of (17) is w = 0. Then we conclude the lemma.

We now turn to prove Theorem 2.1.

Proof of

Theorem

For

Then Theorem 2.1 is proved by the fact that x0  B1/2 \ {0} is arbitrary.

3.2 Proof of Corollary 2.2

Using the upper bound, we shall prove the Harnack inequality.

Proof of Corollary 2.2. Let

2+

2+

w(y) := r p-1 u(ry), v(y) := r p-1 h(ry).

Then

w(x) =

B1/r

|y| |x -

wp(y) y|n-2

dy

+

v(x)

in B1/r\{0}.

Theorem 2.1 gives that there exists a positive constant C such that

w(x)  C in B2\B1/10.

For z  B1, let For x1, x2  B1/2(z),

g(x) =

B1/r \B9/10(z)

|y| wp(y) |x - y|n-2

dy.

g(x1) = =  

B1/r \B9/10(z)

|y| wp(y) |x1 - y|n-2

Hence, g satisfies the Harnack inequality in B1/2(z). Since h  C1(B1) is a positive function,
there exist a constant C0  1 such that maxB1/2(z) v  C0 minB1/2(z) v. On the other hand, we can write w as

w(x) =

B9/10 (z )

|y| wp(y) |x - y|n-2

dy

+

g(x)

+

v(x)

in B1/2(z),

then from Proposition 2.2 in [7] we conclude that

sup w  C inf w.

B1/2 (z )

B1/2 (z )

A covering argument leads to

sup w  C inf w.

We complete the proof of Harnack inequality by rescaling back to u.

4 Asymptotical radial symmetry
Last, we give a proof of the Theorem 2.3 for completely.

4.1 Proof of Theorem 2.3
Proof of Theorem 2.3. Assume that there exists some positive constant   (0, 1) such that for all 0 <  < |x|  , y  B3/2\(B(x)  {0}),

ux,(y)  u(y),

(18)

where

ux,(y) :=

Let r > 0 and x1, x2  Br be such that

and define

Then

|x3| =

(x1 4|x1

r

.

(19)

Via some direct computations and |x1|2 = |x2|2 = r2, we find that

|x3|2

which

follows

from

this

and

(19)

that

It follows from (18) that

ux3,(x2)  u(x2).

Since

=

then

and

2(x2 - x3) |x2 - x3|2

It follows that

u(x) = u¯(|x|)(1 + O(r)) as x  0.

Therefore, in order to complete the proof of Theorem 2.3, it suffices to prove (18).

4.2 The proof of (18)

Replacing

2+
u(x) by r p-1 u(rx) and

h(x)

by

2+
r p-1

h(rx) for

r

=

2 3

,

we can

consider

the

equation

(3) in B3/2 for convenience, namely,

u(y) =

B2/3

|z| up(z) |y - z|n-2

dz

+

h(y)

in B3/2\{0},

(20)

with h  C1(B3/2) is positive and | ln h|  C in B3/2. Moreover, if we extend u to be identically 0 outside B3/2, then (20) can be written as

u(y) =

Rn

|z| |y -

up(z) z|n-2

dz

+

h(y)

in B3/2\{0}.

For

all

0

<

|x|

<

1 16

and



>

0,

it

is

a

straightforward

computation

to

show

that

ux,(y) =
Rn

 |z - x|

p

|zx,| upx,(z) |y - z|n-2

dz

+

hx,(y)

in B3x/,2,

15

where

zx,

:=

x

+

2 (z -x) |z-x|2

,

p

:=

n

+

2

-

p(n

-

2),

B3x/,2

:=

yx,, y  B3/2 . It follows

that

u(y) - ux,(y) =

K(x, ; y, z)

|z-x|

+ h(y) - hx,(y),

|z| up(z) -

 |z - x|

p
|zx,| upx,(z)

where

K(x, ; y, z)

:=

|y

-

1 z|n-2

-

 |y - x|

n-2

|yx,

1 - z|n-2

.

On the other hand, since h  C1(B3/2) is positive and | ln h|  C in B3/2, then by [8, Lemma

3.1], there exists r0  (0, 1/2) depending only on n,  and C such that for every x  B1 and

0 <   r0, there holds

hx,(y)  h(y) in B3/2.

(21)

The aim is to show that there exists some positive constant   (0, r0) such that for |x|  ,

  (0, |x|),

ux,(y)  u(y) in B3/2\(B(x)  {0}),

(22)

that is (18).

4.3 The proof of (22)
To prove (22), for fixed x  B1/16\{0}, we first define
¯(x) := sup 0 < µ  |x| ux,(y)  u(y) in B3/2\(B(x)  {0}),  0 <  < µ ,
and then show ¯(x) = |x|. For sake of clarity, the proof of (22) is divided into three steps. For the first step, we need
the following Claim 1 to make sure that ¯(x) is well defined. Claim 1: There exists 0(x) < |x| such that for all   (0, 0(x)),

ux,(y)  u(y) in B3/2\(B(x)  {0}).

Second, we give that Claim 2: There exists a positive constant   (0, r0) sufficiently small such that for all
|x|  ,   (0, |x|), ux,(y) < u(y) in B3/2\B1/4.

Last, we are going to prove that Claim 3:

¯(x) = |x|.

16

Proof of Claim 1. First of all, we are going to show that there exist µ and 0(x) satisfying 0 < 0(x) < µ < |x| such that for all   (0, 0(x)),

ux,(y)  u(y) in Bµ(x)\B(x).

(23)

Then we will prove that for all   (0, 0(x)),

ux,(y)  u(y) in B3/2\ Bµ(x)  {0} .

(24)

Indeed,

for

every

0

<



<

µ

<

1 2

|x|,

we

have

| ln u|  C0

in B|x|/2(x).

Then for all 0 < r < µ := min

For any y  Bµ(x), 0 <  < |y - x|  µ, let



=

,

r1 = |y - x|,

r2

=

|y

2 - x|2

r1.

It follows that

n-2

n-2

r2 2 u(x + r2) < r1 2 u(x + r1).

That is (23). By equation (3), we have

u(x)  42-n

|y| up(y)dy =: C1 > 0,

(25)

B3/2

and thus we can find 0 < 0(x)  µ such that, for every   (0, 0(x)),

ux,(y)  u(y) in B3/2\ Bµ(x)  {0} ,

that is (24).

Proof of

Claim 2.

For

|y|

we

have

and

x

+

2(y - x) |y - x|2

.

It follows from Theorem 2.1 that

u

Thus, for 0 <  < |x| <

that

(26)

Since

n+ n-2

n+2+2 n-2

we

have

p(n-2)-n- p-1

> 0.

Then by (25),  > 0 can be chosen

sufficiently

small

to

guarantee

that

for

all

r0

and

1 4



|y|



3 2

,

p(n-2)-n-
ux,(y)  C|x| p-1 < u(y).

(27)

Proof of Claim 3. We prove Claim 3 by contradiction. Assume ¯(x) < |x|   < r0 for some

x = 0. We want to show that there exists a positive constant  

0,

|x|-¯(x) 2

such that for

  (¯(x), ¯(x) + ),

ux,(y)  u(y) in B3/2\(B(x)  {0}),

(28)

which contradicts the definition of ¯(x), then we obtain ¯(x) = |x|.
By the Claim 2, it is obviously to obtain that (28) in B3/2\B1/4. Next, we need to consider the region B1/4\(B(x)  {0}).
It is a straightforward computation to show that for every ¯(x)   < |x|  r0,

u(y) - ux,(y) 

K(x, ; y, z)

B1/2 \B (x)

+ J(x, , u, y),

|z| up(z) -

 |z - x|

p
|zx,| upx,(z)

where (21) is used in the above inequality and

J(x, , u, y) :=

K(x, ; y, z)

|z| up(z) -

 |z - x|

p
|zx,| upx,(z)

K(x, ; y, z)

It follows that [15, Proposition 1.3],

J(x, , u, y) 

K(x, ; y, z)|z| up(z) - upx,(z) dz

B3/2 \B1/2

- B3c/2 K(x, ; y, z)|z| upx,(z)dz.

By (25) and (26), we have

K(0, ; y - x, z) = 0,

and

for

(y - x) · yK(0, ; y - x, z) = (n - 2)|y - x|2-n-2(|z|2 - |y - x|2) > 0.

Thus,

(29)

holds

for

With the help of it, for y  B1/4\(B(x)  {0}), there exists positive constants C2 and C3

For  sufficiently small, we have

It follows that we can choose  

0,

|x|-¯(x) 2

such that for every ¯(x)    ¯(x) + , and

y  B1/4\(B(x)  {0}),

u(y) - ux,(y)

K(x, ; y, z) up(z) - upx,(z) dz.

B1/2 \B5/16

Since u C(B¯(x)+(x))  C, it follows that there exists some constant C > 0 such that for any ¯(x)    ¯(x) + , z  B1/4\B(x),
|upx,¯(z) - upx,(z)|  C( - ¯(x))  C.

Moreover, for z  B1/2\B5/16, there exists some constant C1 > 0 such that up(z) - upx,(z)  C1.

Hence, we have

K(0, ; y - x, z)dz.

On the other hand, since

and

21

Then we can choose  sufficient small such that for ¯(x)    ¯(x) + ,
ux,(y)  u(y) in B1/4\(B(x)  {0}).
Combining Claim 2, we get a contradiction and then we finish the proof.
