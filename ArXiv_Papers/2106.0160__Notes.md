## Abstract

We study the problem of controlling the free surface, by fluid jets on the boundary, for a two dimensional solid container in the context of the gravity waves and the sloshing problem. By using conformal maps and the Dirichlet--Neumann operator, the problem is formulated as a second order evolutionary equation on the free surface involving a self-adjoint operator. We present then the appropriate Sobolev spaces where having solutions for the system and study the exact controllability through an observability inequality for the adjoint problem.
