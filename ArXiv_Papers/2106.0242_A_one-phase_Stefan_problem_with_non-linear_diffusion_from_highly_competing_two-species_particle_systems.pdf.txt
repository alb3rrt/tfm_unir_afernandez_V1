Abstract. We consider an interacting particle system with two species under strong competition dynamics between the two species. Then, through the hydrodynamic limit procedure for the microscopic model, we derive a one-phase Stefan type free boundary problem with nonlinear diffusion, letting the competition rate divergent. Non-linearity of diffusion comes from a zero-range dynamics for one species while we impose the other species to weakly diffuse according to the Kawasaki dynamics for technical reasons, which macroscopically corresponds to the vanishing viscosity method.

1. Introduction

Consider two types of species under high competition. As the reaction rate between the two species tends to infinity, they would be spatially segregated and interface appears as boundary of their moving territories. As a mathematical problem, such a limiting procedure is called the spatial-segregation limit and was originally formulated in [9] and [3] as follows. For any positive number K, consider a pair of non-negative solutions (uK, vK ) of the reaction-diffusion system

tu = d1u - Kuv tv = d2v - Kuv

(1.1)

with some additional constraints (usually with Neumann boundary condition on a bounded domain). The spatial dimension is arbitrary in the sequel. Here d1 > 0 and d2  0 are diffusion coefficients. As the competition rate K tends to infinity, solutions (uK , vK ) converges to some (u, v) which satisfies uv  0, in addition, u and v satisfies heat equations with diffusion coefficient d1 and d2, respectively, on their moving domains. In other words, the solutions of (1.1) are spatially segregated, asymptotically as the competition rate tends to infinity, and interface governed by a free boundary problem appears. Alternatively, since the above formulation is concerned with a singular limit for reaction terms, it is also called the fast-reaction limit in some literature. In [9], the authors treated the case with d2 = 0 and derived a free boundary problem called a one-phase Stefan problem. After that, [3] proved that when d2 > 0, a pair of solutions (uK, vK ) converges to a solution of a two-phase Stefan problem under Neumann boundary condition and [2] treated the problem under inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. All the above results consider the singular limit problem for balanced reaction terms, namely when the reaction terms of the reaction-diffusion system coincide up to some constant. For the singular limit problem under unbalanced reaction, [11] studied the case when d2 = 0 and the reaction terms are given by monomials with various exponents. They derived three kinds of liming behavior as the competition rates tend to infinity. At present, few results for unbalanced reaction are known other than this. To other direction, [10] studied the spatial-segregation limit with a

presence of non-linear diffusion. They considered the reaction-diffusion system of the form

tu = (u) - Kuv tv = -Kuv

(1.2)

under an inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and studied the limiting behavior as the reaction rate K tends to infinity. Here  is an increasing function. The limiting equation becomes the following one-phase Stefan problem.

tu = (u) in {u > 0}, tv = v|t=0 in {v > 0}.

(1.3)

The paper [10] introduced the notion of weak solutions in order that the limiting problem makes sense allowing even degenerate diffusion, namely when the derivative of the increasing function  degenerates at zero.
Recently, [5] considered an interacting particle system as a microscopic counterpart of the above high competition dynamics corresponding to the system (1.1) with d1, d2 > 0 and derived the two-phase free boundary problem by which the asymptotic interface is governed, directly from the microscopic model through a scaling limit called the hydrodynamic limit. They considered two-species exclusion processes where the same kind of particles can not stay at the same site and two different kinds of particles coexisting at the same site are killed with rate K(N ), which diverges as the scaling parameter N tends to infinity. For the case where competition between two species is unbalanced, [8] considered two-species exclusion processes which macroscopically correspond to the reaction-diffusion systems studied in [11] and derived the three kinds of interface behavior directly from the particle systems through the hydrodynamic limit. In the model of [8], one species has no diffusion dynamics even microscopically, which asserts the diffusion coefficient of macroscopic density, say v, of that kind of particles exactly equals to zero. For another kind of research concerning singular limit for interacting particle systems, [7] considered a one-species exclusion process with creation and annihilation dynamics whose hydrodynamic limit equation becomes the Cahn-Hilliard equation with a double-well potential (Allen-Cahn type equation) and they studied a fast-reaction limit problem when the reaction rate diverges depending on the scaling parameter of the microscopic model. Among all these microscopic models, the diffusion dynamics is commonly the Kawasaki process, that is, the dynamics of many independent simple random walks under an exclusive restriction, which deduces linear diffusion in hydrodynamic equations.
The aim of this paper is to derive a Stefan type moving boundary problem with possibly nonlinear diffusion (1.3) by scaling limits for microscopic systems. For that purpose, we consider a zero-range process which admit the arbitrary finite number of particles to exist at one site, for which each particle jumps to neighboring sites with a rate depending only on the number of particles at that site. Then one can show that there exists a function  which is naturally determined by jump rates of microscopic particles satisfying some conditions, especially a linear growth condition (see (LG) below) for technical reasons. In this paper, we consider a two-species model on the general dimensional torus with competition which macroscopically corresponds to the reaction-diffusion system (1.2), as in [10], to derive the problem (1.3) by letting the competition rate to be divergent asymptotically as the scaling parameter tends to infinity. As a microscopic counterpart of this one-phase model, it is natural to consider interacting particle systems with two components, say type-1 and type-2 particles, where only type-1 particles diffuse according to the zero-range dynamics while type-2 particles do not move at all. However, treatment of such a situation is technically difficult since for two-species systems, spectral gap estimates, which play an important role to prove hydrodynamic limits, fail to hold unless both types of particles diffuse. To overcome this and prove the hydrodynamic limit in our model, we consider weak diffusion dynamics for type-2 particles. Moreover, since the non-compactness of configuration spaces makes the problem more technically difficult, we impose an exclusion rule

to type-2 particles and let them diffuse according to Kawasaki dynamics with asymptotically negligible diffusion. This macroscopically corresponds to the vanishing viscosity method in PDE theory as follows. We let  be the diffusion coefficient of type-2 density. If  and K is independent of the scaling parameter, then the system of hydrodynamic limit equations becomes

tu = (u) - Kuv tv = v - Kuv

for some non-negative increasing function  determined by the zero-range jump rate of type-1 particles. Here u and v are macroscopic density of type-1 and type-2 particles, respectively. Taking the limit as K   and   0 in the above system, we can derive a quasi-linear freeboundary problem as in [10] noting the existence of a viscosity term does not affect the limiting problem when the reaction rate tends to infinity. What we consider in this paper is to assume  = (N ) vanishes and K = K(N ) diverges as the scaling parameter N tends to infinity and derive the limiting free-boundary problem directly from our microscopic model.
Finally, we summarize the organization of this paper here. In Section 2, we give the precise description of our microscopic model and state the main result. Our main result is to derive a one-phase free-boundary problem with non-linear diffusion (1.3) directly from the zero-rangeKawasaki process with existence of singular competition and slow diffusion for type-2 particles. In Section 3, we give a strategy to prove the main theorem stated in Section 2. The proof is based on Yau's relative entropy method which is introduced in [16]. Then in Section 4, we show that our microscopic density profile is close to macroscopic densities whose time evolution is governed by a semi-discretized system of our hydrodynamic limit equation. This probabilistic procedure is crucial for the proof of the main theorem and it is shown assuming the multi-variable Boltzmann-Gibbs principle. In Section 5, we give some a priori estimates for the semi-discretized system. Then in Section 6, we give the proof of our Boltzmann-Gibbs principle for multi-variable functions. Finally in Section 7, we show a convergence result for the semi-discretized macroscopic system to the Stefan problem with non-linear diffusion (1.3), which completes the proof of the main result combining with the probabilistic part given in Section 4.

2. Model and main result
2.1. Microscopic model. Throughout this paper, we write N = {1, 2, . . .}, Z+ = {0, 1, . . .} and R+ = [0, ). Let TdN = {1, 2, ..., N }d and Td = [0, 1)d be d-dimensional discrete and continuous tori and let XN = XN1 × XN2 := ZT+dN × {0, 1}TdN be a configuration space. An element  = (1, 2)  XN with i = {i(x)}xTdN for i = 1, 2 denotes configuration of our two-species particle system with exclusion rules for type-2 particles. Namely, 1(x) = k  Z+ means there are k type-1 particles on a site x  TdN , and 2(x) = 1 means there exists a type-2 particle on the site. For each i = 1, 2, i(x) = 0 means there is no type-i particle on the site x. First we define an operator which governs the diffusion dynamics. For type-1 particles, we consider a zero-range operator LZ with jump rate g : Z+  R+ satisfying g(0) = 0 and g(k) > 0 for k  1, and an operator LK which corresponds to the Kawasaki process for type-2 particles, which are defined by

LZ f (1, 2) =

g(1(x))[f (1x,y, 2) - f (1, 2)],

x,yTdN ,|x-y|=1

LK f (1, 2) =

2(x)(1 - 2(y))[f (1, 2x,y) - f (1, 2)]

x,yTdN ,|x-y|=1

4

for every f : XN  R. Here for each   XN1 or XN2 , x,y denotes the configuration after a particle on a site x moves to a site y, which is defined by

(x) - 1



 x,y (z )

=

 (y)

+

1

(z)

if z = x, if z = y, otherwise.

Note that looking the form of the Kawasaki generator neither jump from an empty site nor jump to an occupied site occur. Throughout this paper, we impose the following Lipschitz and linear growth conditions on the jump rate of zero-range process g : Z+  R+.
(LIP) supk0 |g(k + 1) - g(k)| < . (LG) There exist constants C > 0, r1 > 0 and r2  N such that g(k)  Ck and g(k + r2) -
g(k)  r1 for every k  N.
Next we define a family of reference measures which are parametrized by density of each kind of particles. First, for given constant   0, let 1, be a probability measure on Z+ given by

 1, (k)

=

1 Z

k g(k)!

,

Z =



k g(k)!

k=0

where g(k)! = g(1) · · · g(k) for k  1 and g(0)! = 1. Note that under the condition (LG), the
radius of convergence of Z becomes infinity so that the measure 1, is well-defined for every   0. Moreover, through a similar manner in [13], there exists a unique function  : R+  R+ such that  = E1,()[1(x)] for each   0. This is possible under our assumption (LG) and this determines a possibly non-linear smooth function  associated with the jump rate g. Hereafter we simply write 1, := 1,(). Note that an easy computation yields () = ()/Var[1(x)] so that the function  is increasing on R+. Moreover, noting an expression () = (d/d) log Z, we have (0) = 1/(d/d)(0)  c0 for some constant c0 > 0. We extend 1,u as a product measure 1,u = xTdN 1,u(x) for every u = {u(x)}xTdN such that u(x)  0 for each x  TdN . On the other hand, for any v = {v(x)}  [0, 1]TdN , let 2,v be a product Bernoulli measure on XN2 = {0, 1}TdN whose marginals are given by 2,v(2(x) = 1) = v(x) for every x  TdN . Finally, we define a spatially inhomogeneous product measure (u,v) on XN = XN1 × XN2 by (u,v) := 1,u  2,v for each u = {u(x)}xTdN , v = {v(x)}xTdN with u(x)  0 and 0  v(x)  1 for every x  TdN . Throughout this paper, we fix a jump rate g of the zero-range process satisfying the assumption (LG).
Next we define the Glauber operator LG by

LGf (1, 2) =

1(x)2(x)[f (1x,-, 2x,-) - f (1, 2)]

xTdN

where for each   ZT+dN or {0, 1}TdN the transition   x,- decreases the number of corresponding type of particles on a site x  TdN if possible, which is defined by

x,-(z) =

(x) - 1 (z)

if z = x, otherwise.

Here we also note that the above killing action occurs only when there is at least each of one particle for both of two types on a site x since otherwise we have 1(x)2(x) = 0. Let K = K(N ) and  = (N ) be parameters which satisfy the following bounds as the scaling parameter N tends to infinity.
(B1) K = K(N ) diverges as N tends to infinity satisfying 1  K(N )  (1 log(2 log N ))1/2 with 1, 2 > 0 small enough.

(B2)  = (N ) vanishes as N tends to infinity satisfying (N )  N - for some small constant  > 0.
Then, let {tN = (1N,t, 2N,t)}t0 be a XN -valued Markov process with generator LN = N 2LZ + (N )LK + K(N )LG and initial distribution µN0 on XN which is constructed on some probability space (N , FN , PNµN0 ). When the initial distribution µN0 is clear from the context, we omit the dependence on it. We denote the expectation with respect to PNµN0 (or PN ) by ENµN0 (or EN ).
Remark 2.1. A reason why we introduced the weak diffusion for type-2 particles with intensity (N ) is mainly for using spectral gap estimates to prove the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle, which will be explained later (see Section 6). The slower the parameter (N ) decays, the easier the proof of the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle becomes. We can find that the above polynomial decay is enough for that. The bound for the reaction rate K(N ) is also needed for our strategy of proof.

Now we state some assumptions on the initial distribution µN0 . For that purpose, we prepare

some notations. For two probability measures  and µ on XN , define relative entropy of µ with

respect to  by

H(µ|) =

dµ log dµ d

XN d d

if µ is absolutely continuous with respect to , and otherwise we let H(µ|) = . Moreover, we

define the discrete gradient N by N = t(1N , . . . , dN ) with jN u(x) = N (u(x + ej) - u(x)) for any j = 1, . . . , d and any u = {u(x)}xTdN . Then we assume that there exist functions uN0 , v0N on TdN and functions u0, v0 on Td such that the following conditions hold.

(A1) There exist constants C0, C1 > 0, Mu  0 and 0  Mv < 1 such that

e-C1K(N)  uN0 (x)  Mu, |N uN0 (x)|  C0K(N ), |iN jN uN0 (x)|  C0K(N )3

e-C1K(N)  v0N (x)  Mv, |N v0N (x)|  C0-1/2K(N )

for every x  TdN and i, j = 1, . . . , d. (A2) For the product measure 0N = (uN0 ,v0N )  P(XN ) with weight (uN0 , v0N ) in the assumption
(A1), the initial distribution µN0  P(XN ) satisfies H(µN0 |0N ) = O(N d-0) for some small positive constant 0 as N tends to infinity, that is, there exists a positive constant C such that H(µN0 |0N )  CN d-0 for every sufficiently large N . (A3) u0, v0  L2(Td) and uN0  u0 and v0N  v0 weakly in L2(Td) as N tends to infinity.

Remark 2.2. As discussed in [8] there exists non-trivial macroscopic initial functions u0 and v0 and microscopic approximating sequences {uN0 }NN and {v0N }NN satisfying the above assumptions (A1), (A2) and (A3) (though [8] imposed a restriction only for the first derivative growth, we can construct an example in a similar way).

2.2. Main result. We define empirical measures associated with the Markov process {tN : t  [0, T ]} by

iN,t(d) = N -d

iN,t(x)x/N (d), i = 1, 2.

xTdN

Here  stands for the Dirac delta measure on Td. We write tN ,  = ( 1N,t, 1 , 2N,t, 2 ) with
iN,t, i = Td i()iN,t(d) for every  = (1, 2)  C(Td, R2). To state the main theorem in this paper, we introduce the notion of weak solution of the following Stefan problem.

tw = D(w) in QT , w(0, ·) = u0 - v0 on Td

(2.1)

where D is a function on R defined by D(s) = (s)1[0,)(s) and QT := [0, T ] × Td.

Definition 2.1. A function w  L(QT ) is called a weak solution of the problem (2.1) with initial function w0  L(Td) if the following conditions (i) and (ii) hold. (i) (w+)  L2(0, T ; H1(Td)), (ii) For every T > 0, the function w satisfies an integral identity

w+t - (w+) ·  (t, )ddt = 0

Td

0 Td

for any test function   L2(0, T ; H1(Td)) such that (T, ·)  0.

(2.2)

Let w be a weak solution of the problem (2.1) and suppose functions u := w+ and v := w- satisfy supp(u(t, ·))  supp(v(t, ·)) = , and the closure of the region supp(u(t, ·))  supp(v(t, ·)) is Td for every t  [0, T ]. Here w+ = max{w, 0} and w- = max{-w, 0} are positive and negative part of w, respectively. Moreover we define

u :=

{t} × u(t), v :=

{t} × v(t),  :=

{t} × (t)

t(0,T )

t(0,T )

t(0,T )

for u(t) := {u(t, ·) > 0}, v(t) := {v(t, ·) > 0} and (t) := u(t) = v(t). If u is smooth in u(t) and (t) is smooth, then we have the following strong form of one-phase Stefan problem.

tu = (u)  v = v0
u=0   u(0, ·) = u0(·),

v(0, ·) = v0(·)

in u, in v, on , on Td.

Using the above notion of weak solutions, our main theorem can be stated as follows.

Theorem 2.1. Assume initial functions uN0 , v0N , u0 and v0 satisfy (A1), (A2) and (A3), and assume the scaling parameters K = K(N ) and  = (N ) satisfy (B1) and (B2). Then there exist non-negative functions u and v on QT such that u(t, ·)v(t, ·) = 0 a.e. on Td for each t  (0, T ], and for every   C(QT ; R2) and  > 0 we have

Moreover, w := u - v is a unique weak solution of the Stefan problem (2.1). In particular, the

spatially segregated functions u and v are uniquely determined from the function w.

3. Strategy of proof

3.1. Yau's relative entropy method. In this section, we give the proof of the main theorem (Theorem 2.1) based on Yau's relative entropy method which is introduced in [16]. We first concern a probability part which asserts that at any give time, the microscopic density profile is close to the macroscopic one in the sense of relative entropy (see Theorem 3.1 below). Let uN = {uN (t, x)}t[0,T ],xTdN , vN = {vN (t, x)}t[0,T ],xTdN be a pair of solutions of the following semi-discretized reaction-diffusion system.

tuN (t, x) = N (uN (t, x)) - K(N )uN (t, x)vN (t, x) 
tvN (t, x) = (N )N uN (t, x) - K(N )uN (t, x)vN (t, x)
uN (0, x) = uN0 (x), vN (0, x) = v0N (x)

in (0, T ) × TdN , in (0, T ) × TdN , on TdN

(3.1)

with initial functions uN0 and v0N on TdN satisfying the assumptions (A1), (A2) and (A3). Here, N is the discrete Laplacian defined by

N u(x) = N 2

u(x + ej) + u(x - ej) - 2u(x)

for any u = {u(x)}xTdN where {ej }j=1,...,d is the normal basis on Zd. Let tN = (uN (t),vN (t)) be the spatially inhomogeneous product measure on the configuration space XN with uN (t) = {uN (t, x)}xTdN and vN (t) = {vN (t, x)}xTdN , and let µNt be the probability law of tN = (1N,t, 2N,t) on XN . According to a comparison argument we give in Section 5 (see Lemma 5.2), we can show that the semi-discretized solutions uN and vN take values in R+ and [0, 1], respectively, which makes the product measure tN well-defined. Then we can show the following key estimate which states the microscopic measure µNt is asymptotically close to the measure tN . Theorem 3.1. Assume (A1), (A2), (B1) and (B2). Then for every t  0 we have H(µNt |tN ) = o(N d) as N tends to infinity.

Next we extend uN and vN on QT = [0, T ]×Td as simple functions, the extensions are denoted again with the same notation, by

(3.2)

for every t  [0, T ] and  = (j)j=1,...,d  Td. For these extended functions uN and vN on QT , we can show the following convergence result, which is purely a deterministic problem.

Theorem 3.2. Assume (A1), (A3), (B1) and (B2). Let uN and vN be functions on QT defined by (3.2). There exist functions u and v on QT such that u(0, ·) = u0(·), v(0, ·) = v0(·) and
u  L(QT )  L2(0, T ; H1(Td)), v  L(QT ), 0  u  Mu, 0  v  Mv and uv = 0 a.e. in QT , uN  u strongly in L2(QT ) and a.e. in QT , vN  v weakly in L2(QT )

as N tends to infinity. Moreover, w := u - v is a unique weak solution of the problem (2.1) with initial function u0 - v0.

Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.2 will be proved in Section 4 and Section 7, respectively.

3.2. Proof of Theorem 2.1. Once Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.2 are proved, we can show the main theorem as follows. Let uN and vN be the functions on QT = [0, T ] × Td defined by (3.2). For any  > 0 and any smooth function   C(Td), let us define

A1 = A1(, ) := {  XN ; 1N,t,  - uN (t, ·),  L2(Td) > },

A2 = A2(, ) := {  XN ; 2N,t,  - vN (t, ·),  L2(Td) > }.

Then, as a corollary of the entropy inequality, we get

µNt (Ai)

H(µNt |tN ) 1/tN (Ai))

,

i = 1, 2.

The next result is a direct consequence of the exponential Markov inequality.

Lemma 3.3. For any   C(Td) and  > 0, there exists a positive constant C = C(,  L(Td)) such that
tN (Ai(, ))  exp(-CN d).
In particular, the above estimate holds uniformly in {;  L(Td) < M } for every M > 0.

Then by Theorem 3.1, we have limN µNt (Ai(i(t, ·), )) = 0 for each i = 1, 2, t  [0, T ],  > 0 and  = (1, 2)  C(QT ; R2).
Now we estimate the probability appearing in the main theorem (Theorem 2.1) by using
Markov's inequality and the triangle inequality by

(3.3)

We can see that these two terms vanish as N tends to infinity. Indeed, since uN  u and vN  v weakly in L2(QT ) by Theorem 3.2, the second term in (3.3) vanishes as N tends to infinity. On
the other hand, the integrand in the first term can be bounded above by

EµNt tN ,  - (uN (t, ·), vN (t, ·)), (t, ·) L2 (Td) ,

Ai(i(t, ·), ~) + ~

Hence we finish the proof since ~ was arbitrary.

4. Proof of Theorem 3.1

In this section, we give the proof of Theorem 3.1 as a probabilistic problem. For that purpose, we estimate the derivative of the relative entropy H(µNt |tN ) in time argument which is called the entropy production. First we define a Dirichlet energy for our diffusion dynamics. For any
non-negative function f and probability measure  on the configuration XN , define

where {ej}j=1,...,d is the normal basis of Zd. Then define D = 2N 2DZ + 2(N )N 2DK. We have the following estimate of the entropy production.

Proposition 4.1 (Yau's inequality, [12]). For any probability measures {t}t0 and m on XN which are differentiable in t and full-supported, we have

Now combining the above main estimate and Yau's inequality (Proposition 4.1) with t = tN and t = tN = dtN /dm, we can give the proof of the probabilistic part (Theorem 3.1).

Proof of Theorem 3.1. We apply Yau's inequality with  = tN integrated over [0, t]. Then, the time integral of the Dirichlet energy corresponding to Kawasaki dynamics appearing in the

right-hand side of the estimate given in Theorem 4.2 can be absorbed into the total Dirichlet

energy with negative sign in Yau's inequality. Therefore, there exists a positive constant C such

that

t
H(µNt |tN )  H(µN0 |tN ) + CK3eCK2 H(µNs |sN )ds + O(K4eCK2N d-0 )
0

as N tends to infinity. By applying Gronwall's inequality, noting H(µN0 |0N ) = O(N d-0 ) by the assumption (A2), there exists a positive constant C = C(T ) such that

H(µNt |tN )  H(µN0 |0N ) + O(K4eCK2N d-0 ) eCK3eCK2
for every t  [0, T ]. Now we take K = K(N ) so that K2  1 log(2 log N ) with 1, 2 > 0 satisfying C1  1 and 2  (0  0)/2 by assumption (B1). Then we have eC(T 1)K2  2 log N so that H(µNt |tN ) = O(N d-(00)/2), which is the desired assertion in Theorem 3.1.

Hence our task is now to show the main estimate Theorem 4.2. In this subsection, we see that one can linearize some terms in the integrand LN,tN 1-t log tN with the help of so called the `multi-variable Boltzmann-Gibbs principle' and give the proof of Theorem 4.2. To see that, fix an arbitrary local function h on XN with support in a finite square box h  TdN and parameter  = (1, 2) with 1  0 and 0  2  1. We write
h~() := E [h].
Assume that there exists a positive constant C such that

|h()|  C

g1(y, 2(y))1(y) + g2(y, 2(y))

yh

(4.1)

for every  = (1, 2)  XN where g1(y, 2) and g2(y, 2) are polynomials of {2(z); z  h} for each y  h. Given such a local function h, the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle enables us to extract the "linear part" of h. To see that, we define a residual function R : TdN × XN1 × XN2  R of h by
R(x, 1, 2) :=xh(1, 2) - h~(uN (t, x), vN (t, x))
- 1h~(uN (t, x), vN (t, x))(1(x) - uN (t, x))
- 2h~(uN (t, x), vN (t, x))(2(x) - vN (t, x))

where uN and vN are solutions to the semi-discretized reaction-diffusion system (3.1) and i denotes the derivative with respect to the i-th component (i = 1, 2) for every differentiable function on R2. In the sequel, we omit the dependence on configuration and simply write as
R(x) = R(x, 1, 2). Then the multi-variable Boltzmann-Gibbs principle is stated as follows.

as N tends to infinity. Moreover, we may take 0 = d/(3d + 1).

We postpone the proof of Theorem 4.3 in Section 6 and give a proof of Theorem 4.2 here.

Proof of Theorem 4.2. First we introduce rescaled variables

1,x

:=

1(x) - uN 1(uN (t,

(t, x) x))

,

2,x

:=

2(x) - vN (t, x) 2(vN (t, x))

where 1(1) = Var1,1 [1(0)] = (1)/(1) and 2(2) = Var2,2 [2(0)] = 2(1-2) for every 1  0 and 0  2  1. The Boltzmann-Gibbs principle enables us to extract leading terms, and to rewrite the integrand LN,tN 1 -  log tN into a linear combination of , asymptotically as N tends to infinity. As one can easily verify, the integrand can be calculated as

LN,tN 1 - t log tN

=

N (uN (t, x)) (uN (t, x))

g(1(x)) - (uN (t, x))

In this identity, we let possibly non-linear terms in  as

We apply the multi-variable Boltzmann-Gibbs principle (Theorem 4.3) to replace them by linear combination of rescaled variables 1 and 2. First, for I1 let h() = g(1(x))-(uN (t, x)). Then we have h~() = ()-(uN (t, x)) as g~() = E [g] = (), which implies h~(uN (t, x), vN (t, x)) = 0, 1h~(uN (t, x), vN (t, x)) = (uN (t, x)) and 2h~(uN (t, x), vN (t, x)) = 0. Therefore, by the
Boltzmann-Gibbs principle applied to this local function h, there exists a positive constant C

Next we show that I3 can be decomposed into a linear part plus some residual term which can be quantitatively estimated. To see that, we take a local function h as the summand appearing

in the definition of I3. Then, since 1 and 2 are independent under our reference measure  for any  = (1, 2), we calculate as

h~() =

(uN (t, x)) vN (t, x)  k + 1 (1)k

so that h~(uN (t, x), vN (t, x)) = 0. Moreover, the above explicit calculation of h~() enables us to

obtain

By this line, replace I1(resp. I3) by I~1(resp. I~3) and sum up all terms in (4.2) to see that linear terms in rescaled variables 1 and 2 cancel by virtue of the semi-discretized reaction-diffusion system (3.1).
Finally we conduct a replacement procedure for I2. If we apply the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle also for I2, which is a two-point correlation of 2, then we can replace it by a linear combination of 2. This object is expected to be asymptotically small since each 2,x is mean-zero under the local equilibrium state. To replace I2 exactly by zero for convenience for PDE part, we use the following Lemma 4.4. Note that the object to be replaced here is K2 |x-y|=1 2,x2,y since we have a gradient estimate |N vN (t, x)| = O(-1/2K) as N tends to infinity by Lemma 5.8, while
in [7] the diffusion coefficient  for v is a constant which is independent of the scaling parameter
N.

ftN ; tN + CK2H(µNt |tN ) + O(N d-0 )

4.1. Proof of Lemma 4.4. In this subsection, we prove Lemma 4.4. The key idea of the proof is similar to previous researches ([7], [5] and [8]) so we only give a sketch here. Define

V := K2

Gx+y

for G = {Gx}xTdN with + := [0,  - 1]d  Zd. We omit the dependence on i for simplicity. One can estimate the cost to replace V by its local average V  as follows.

Lemma 4.5. Assume (A1), (B1) and (B2). We choose  = N 1/d-/d when d  2 and  = N 1/2- when d = 1 with  > 0 sufficiently small. Then for any  > 0 there exists some
C = C(, ) > 0 such that

EµNt [V - V ]  N 2DK ( ftN ; tN ) + C H(µNt |tN ) + N d-1+
when d  2. When d = 1, we have the same estimate with the last term N d-1+ replaced by N 1/2+.
To give a proof of Lemma 4.5, we introduce the notion of flows on graph.
Definition 4.1. Let G = (V, E) be a finite graph where V is a set of all vertices and E is the set of all edges. For two probability measures p, q on V , we call  = {(x, y)}{x,y}E a flow on G connecting p and q if it satisfies:
· (y, x) = -(x, y) for all {x, y}  E, · zV (x, z) = p(x) - q(x) holds for all x  V .
In the sequel, we regard any finite subset in Zd as a graph where the set of all bonds means the set of all pair of two points in that set such that the Euclidean distance between them is 1. The next result is a key ingredient.
Proposition 4.6 (Flow lemma, [12]). Let 0 be the Dirac measure on Zd with mass 1 on 0  Zd and let p be the uniform probability measure on Zd with mass on  defined by p(x) = |+ |-11+ (x). Moreover, let q be the probability measure on Zd defined by q(x) =

A STEFAN PROBLEM WITH NON-LINEAR DIFFUSION FROM PARTICLE SYSTEMS

p  p(x) := yZd p(y)p(x - y). Then there exists a flow  on +2 connecting 0 and q such that (x, y) = 0 for any x  (+2)c and y  Zd, and that

(x, x + ej )2  Cdgd(),

  gd() = log

if d = 1, if d = 2, otherwise.

Taking a flow connecting 0 and q, a careful calculation (see [5] or [8]) enables us to write

V - V  = K2

(4.3)

that hx,j is invariant Moreover, since 2,x

and 2,x2,y with x = y has average zero under tN , there exists a positive constant C which is

independent of N such that

EtN [hx,j ] = 0, VartN [hx,j]  Cgd()e2C1K by the flow lemma (Proposition 4.6) and the lower bound of uN according to Lemma 5.2.

Lemma 4.7. Assume (A1) and let f be any density with respect to tN . Then we have

We next bound the summand in (4.3) with the help of the above results. DK (f ; ) = xTdN j=1,...,d DK;x,x+ej (f ; ).

Lemma 4.8. Assume (A1) and let f be any density with respect to tN . Then there exists a positive constant C such that for every  > 0, x  TdN and j = 1, . . . , d,

Recall that the residual term Rx,j has the bound (4.5) for every x  TdN and j = 1, . . . , d. Since |vN (t, x) - vN (t, x + ej)|  C-1/2KN -1 by the gradient estimate given in Lemma 5.6, estimating |hx,j|  1 + (hx,j )2, we have

for every x  TdN and j = 1, . . . , d. Therefore, the expectation with respect to µN of V - V  is bounded above by

(hx,j )2dµNt + C-1/2K3e3C1K N d-1

with some positive constant C = C(). For the second term, noting that the random variables {hx,j} are (2 - 1)-dependent, we decompose the summation xTdN into y+2 z(4)TdN TdN and then apply the entropy inequality. Then we have

for every 0 <   C0-2. Hence, choosing -1 = C0-1Cdgd()e2C1K , we can see that EµNt [V -V ] is bounded above by

N 2DK ( ftN ; tN ) + C-1dgd()K4e5C1K N -1 H(µNt |tN ) + N d-d + C-1/2K3e3C1K N d-1.
Now recall that the assumptions (B1) and (B2) assured the growth rate of K and -1 was suppressed by a monomial of N with a sufficiently small exponent. In particular, divergent elements in the above display along the parameters K and -1 can be absorbed into N in the denominators so that we may treat K and -1 as if they were constants independent of N . Hence we complete the proof by choosing  = N 1/d-/d when d  2 and  = N 1/2- when d = 1.
Lemma 4.9. Choose  = N 1/d-/d when d  2 and  = N 1/2- when d = 1. For any  > 0, there exists a positive constant C such that

5. Several estimates for the reaction-diffusion system (3.1)

Lemma 5.1 (Comparison principle). Let  be a differentiable non-decreasing function on R

and let (t, u)  f (t, x, u) be a C1-smooth function on [0, T ] × RNd for every x  TdN . Let uN = {uN (t, x)}t0,xTdN be a solution of

tuN (t, x) = N (uN (t, x)) + f (t, x, uN (t))

(5.1)

and let uN+ (resp. uN- ) be super- (resp. sub-) solution of (5.1), namely, uN+ (resp. uN- ) satisfies the equation (5.1) with "" (resp. "") instead of the equality. Assume that uN+ (0, x)  uN (t, x) (resp. uN- (0, x)  uN (0, x)) holds for every x  TdN . Then we have that uN+ (t, x)  uN (t, x) (resp. uN- (t, x)  uN (t, x)) holds for every t  [0, T ] and x  TdN .

The proof is intuitively given as follows. We may only consider super-solutions since sub-
solutions can be treated in the same way. Suppose there exists some point (t0, x0) such that uN+ (t0, x0) = uN (t0, x0). Then, since uN+ is a super-solution of (5.1) and  is an increasing function, we have

t(uN+ - uN )(t0, x0)

 N (uN+ ) - (uN ) (t0, x0) + f (t0, x0, uN+ (t0)) - f (t0, x0, uN (t0))

2d

=

(uN+ ) - (uN ) (t0, x0 + ej )  0

j=1

where we set ej+d = -ej for every j = 1, . . . , d. The above estimate implies that uN+ - uN is positively drifted at the point (t0, x0) and thus the solution uN will not be able to exceed the super-solution uN+ for any time t  [0, T ].

Proof of Lemma 5.1. We show the assertion only for super-solutions since sub-solutions can be treated similarly. Let uN+ be a super­solution of (5.1) satisfying uN+ (0, x)  uN (0, x) for every x  TdN . Then, by definition of super-solution, uN+ satisfies

tuN (t, x)  N uN (t, x) + f (t, x, uN (t))

for every t  [0, T ] and x  TdN . Then subtracting (5.1) on the above display to get t(uN+ - uN )(t, x)  N (uN+ - uN )(t, x) + f~(t, x, u+(t), u(t))(uN+ - uN )(t, x).

Here, f~ = f~(t, x, uN+ (t), uN (t)) is defined by

if uN+ (t, x) = uN (t, x), if uN+ (t, x) = uN (t, x).

Let M := sup(t,x)[0,T ]×TdN |f~(t, x, uN+ (t), uN (t))| and let wN (t, x) be a function defined by wN (t, x) = (uN+ (t, x) - uN (t, x))eMt + 2 - e-t

for any  > 0. Note here that such M <  exists since uN+ (t, x) and uN (t, x) are both continuous in t for every x  TdN . Moreover, by the assumption for the initial function we have wN (0, x) > 0 for every x  TdN . In the sequel, we prove wN  0 in [0, T ] × TdN by showing contradiction. Suppose there exists a point (t0, x0)  (0, T ] × TdN such that wN (t0, x0) = 0 for the first time and wN (t, x) > 0 for every t  [0, t0) and x  TdN . Then, since (t0, x0) attains minimum of wN in [0, t0] × TdN , we have twN (t0, x0)  0 and N wN (t0, x0) = N (uN+ - uN )(t0, x0)eMt0  0. In particular, since (uN+ (t0, x0)) - (uN (t0, x0)) = (u^)(uN+ - uN )(t0, x0) for some u^ between

16

K. HAYASHI

uN+ (t0, x0) and uN (t0, x0) by the mean-value theorem, recalling the definition of the discrete Laplacian N and that  is non-decreasing, we deduce N (uN+ (t0, x0))-(uN (t0, x0)) eMt0  0. Therefore, we have

twN (t0, x0) - N (uN+ (t0, x0)) - (uN (t0, x0)) eMt0  0.

(5.3)

On the other hand, letting u~N := uN+ - uN , we have

twN (t0, x0) - N (uN+ (t0, x0)) - (uN (t0, x0)) = tu~N (t0, x0) + M u~N (t0, x0) eMt0 + e-t0 - (uN+ (t0, x0)) - (uN (t0, x0)) eMt0  - f~(t0, x0, uN (t0), uN (t0)) + M u~N (t0, x0)eMt0 + e-t0

since uN+ is a super-solution. However, recalling the definition of M , the last quantity is bounded from below by a strictly positive constant, which is contradiction to (5.3). Therefore, we have
wN  0 in [0, T ] × TdN so that uN+ (t, x) - uN (t, x)  (e-t - 2)e-Mt for every (t, x)  [0, T ] × TdN . Since  > 0 was taken arbitrary, we complete the proof by letting  tends to zero.

In the sequel, let uN and vN be a solution of semi-discretized system (3.1). Applying the above comparison theorem, we get the following uniform estimates for values of uN and vN
which is independent of N .

Lemma 5.2. Assume there exist constants C1 > 0, Mu  0 and 0  Mv  1 such that
e-C1K  uN (0, x)  Mu, e-C1K  vN (0, x)  Mv
for every x  TdN . Then, there exists a constant C = C(C1, T ) > 0 such that e-CK  uN (t, x)  Mu, e-CK  vN (t, x)  Mv
for every t  [0, T ] and x  TdN . In particular, (uN , vN ) takes values in R+ × [0, 1].
Proof. This can be done due to the comparison theorem given above. First, we can easily see that the zero-function is a sub-solution for both two equations of the system (3.1) so that we may assume uN and vN are non-negative. Then, we see that the constant function Mu (resp. Mv) is a super-solution for the first (resp. second) equation of the system (3.1) and the upper bound is thus proved. Next we show the lower bound. Let us define uN (t, x) = e-C1Ke-MvKt and vN (t, x) = e-C1K e-MuKt. Then by the assumption, we have uN (0, x)  uN (0, x) = e-C1K and vN (0, x)  vN (0, x) = e-C1K for every x  TdN . Moreover, since uN and vN are spatially homogeneous, we have
tuN (t, x) = N (uN (t, x)) - KMvuN (t, x)  N (uN (t, x)) - KvN (t, x)uN (t, x), tvN (t, x) = N vN (t, x) - KMuvN (t, x)  N uN (t, x) - KuN (t, x)vN (t, x)
for every t  [0, T ] and x  TdN noting uN and vN stay non-negative. Therefore, uN and vN are sub-solutions and thus we obtain the desired lower bound again by the comparison principle (Theorem 5.1).

Lemma 5.3. We have that

Proof. From the first equation of (3.1), integrating over t  [0, T ] and x  TdN to represent the integration of reaction term by terms which are independent of K(N ). Since summation over x  TdN of N uN (t, x) vanishes and the term involving time derivative becomes an integration on the boundary, the proof is obvious in view of the uniform boundedness of uN (Lemma 5.2).

Recall for every   N we denote  := [-, ]d  Zd the centered rectangle with length 2 + 1 and we write its volume as || = (2 + 1)d. We have the following energy estimates for semi-discretized solutions uN and vN .

Lemma 5.4. Assume uN and vN are bounded non-negative solution of (3.1). Then there exists a positive constant C such that

with c0 > 0. Here in the last estimate we used the mean-value theorem (note here that the function  is assumed to be differentiable and non-decreasing) and dropped the second term in the penultimate line. Therefore, noting the boundedness of uN , integrate over time argument t  [0, T ] to get the desired energy estimate. The assertion for vN can be shown similarly.
On the other hand, by Jensen's inequality we have

Then, decompose uN (t, x+z)-uN (t, x) = [uN (t, x+ z) - uN (t, x + y|z|-1)] + · · · + [uN (t, x + y1) - uN (t, x)] and use (a1 + · · · + an)2  n(a21 + · · · + a2n) to conclude

Now integrating over t  [0, T ] and using the first assertion which is proved in the above, the last quantity is bounded above by Cd+2N d for some C > 0. Hence, dividing by (2 + 1)d, we
get the second assertion and complete the proof.

Next we give some L-estimates for discrete gradient for uN and vN . To see that, it is crucial
to estimate discrete derivatives of the fundamental solution of divergence operators corresponding to uN and vN , for which the next result by [4] is applicable.

18

K. HAYASHI

Proposition 5.5 ([4]). Let p(t, x, y) be the fundamental solution corresponding to a symmetric, uniform elliptic divergence operator L on Zd. Then there exist positive constants C and c such that
|N p(t, x, y)|  CN (t  1)-1/2p(ct, x, y)
for every t > 0 and x, y  TdN .

Then, as indicated in [7] or [5], letting pN (t, x, y) be the fundamental solution corresponding to a symmetric, uniform elliptic divergence operator LN on TdN , we have pN (t, x, y) =
kNZd p(N 2t, x, y + k) for every t  0 and x, y  TdN . Therefore, applying the result by [4] (Proposition 5.5), we obtain an estimate

|N pN (t, x, y)|  Ct-1/2pN (ct, x, y).

(5.4)

Now by applying this L-estimate for discrete gradient of the fundamental solution, we can also estimate discrete derivatives of uN and vN . The proof is similar to [6], which concerns a
fast-reaction limit problem for one-species model.

Lemma 5.6. There exists a positive constant C such that

|N uN (t, x)|  K(C0 + Ct1/2)

for every t  [0, T ] and x  TdN provided the assertion holds at time t = 0.

Proof. First we take j-th discrete derivative jN to the first equation of (3.1) to deduce

tjN uN (t, x) = N jN (uN (t, x)) - KjN uN (t, x)vN (t, x) .

(5.5)

The first term in the right-hand side of the last identity can further be calculated as

N jN (uN (t, x)) = N N · -eN (uN (t, x + ej)) - (uN (t, x)) = N 2N · (uN (t, x + ej )) - (uN (t, x + ej - ei)) - (uN (t, x)) - (uN (t, x - ei)) i=1,...,d.

However, by Taylor's theorem, there exist u1 between uN (t, x + ej) and uN (t, x), and u2 between uN (t, x + ej - ei) and uN (t, x) such that

(uN (t, x + ej)) - (uN (t, x + ej - ei)) =j(uN (t, x)) uN (t, x + ej) - uN (t, x + ej - ei)

+

(u1) 2

uN (t, x + ej) - uN (t, x)

2

+

(u2) 2

uN (t, x + ej - ei) - uN (t, x)

2.

Similarly, we also have an expansion

(uN (t, x)) - (uN (t, x - ei)) =j(uN (t, x)) uN (t, x) - uN (t, x - ei)

+

(u1) 2

uN (t, x) - uN (t, x - ei)

2

for some u3 between uN (t, x - ei) and uN (t, x). Hence we can rewrite (5.5) as

tjN uN (t, x) = LN jN uN (t, x) + R(t, x) - KjN uN (t, x)vN (t, x)

(5.6)

where LN1 is a second order discrete divergence operator defined by LN1 w(x) = N · (uN (t, x))-eN w(x)
for any real-valued function w on the configuration space XN . Regarding uN as a given function in the above definition, we can easily see that the operator LN1 is a symmetric, non-positive linear functional on 2(TdN ). Therefore, there exists a fundamental solution corresponding to

A STEFAN PROBLEM WITH NON-LINEAR DIFFUSION FROM PARTICLE SYSTEMS

19

the operator LN on TdN , which is denoted by pN1 (t, x, y). Hence we apply Duhamel's principle to the above identity (5.6) to obtain

t

jN uN (t, x) =

pN1 (t, x, y)jN uN (0, x) +

pN1 (t - s, x, y)R(s, y)ds

-K

pN1 (t - s, x, y)jN uN (s, y)vN (s, y) ds

for every j = 1, . . . , d. Recall here that R is a divergence form of quadratic function of uN and also note that the third term in the last identity is a divergence form. Therefore, integration by parts combining with an estimate (5.4) for pN and the uniform boundedness of uN and vN
given in Lemma 5.2 enables us to deduce

t

N uN (t, ·) L  C N uN (0, ·) L + C

for some positive constant C. Now let m(t) := sup0st supxTdN |N uN (s, x)|. Then combining with the assumption for N uN (0, x), there exists a constant C > 0 such that
m(t)  Ctm(t)2 + CK

for every t  [0, T ]. By solving this quadratic inequality, we have

m(t)  1 -

K

 t

2C t

provided t  t := (4C2K)-2 where the other inequality can be rejected due to an estimate around t = 0 by the assumption for the initial value m(0) and the continuity of t  m(t). Since
the right-hand side of the last estimate is increasing in time t, we obtain m(t)  2CK for every
t  t. On the other hand, we derive an estimate for the other range (t, T ] of the interval [0, T ].
To see that, one can notice that the non-linear diffusion operator N (·) can be regarded as a linear Laplacian. Indeed, we have for any real-valued function u on TdN that

N (u(x)) = N · -eN (u(x)) = N · -e (x, ej ; u)jN u(x) j=1,...,d

where -e denotes the shift to the direction (-1, . . . , -1)  Rd acting on any d-dimensional vectors, and (x, ej ; u) is defined by

 (u(x + ej)) - (u(x)) (x, ej ; u) =  u(x + ej) - u(x)
(u(x))

if u(x + ej) = u(x), if u(x + ej) = u(x).

Now let LN2 be a second order discrete divergence operator defined by

LN2 w(x) = N · -e (x, ej ; uN (t))jN w(x) j=1,...,d

for every real-valued function w on the configuration space XN . Similarly for the operator LN1 given above, the operator LN is a symmetric, non-positive linear functional on 2(TdN ) when uN is regarded as a given function. Therefore, there exists a fundamental solution pN2 (t, x, y) corresponding to the operator LN2 satisfying an derivative estimate (5.4). By virtue of Duhamel's principle applied to the first equation of the discrete reaction-diffusion system (3.1), we thus

obtain

t

uN (t, x) =

pN2 (t, x, y)uN (0, y) - K

pN2 (t - s, x, y)uN (s, y)vN (s, y)ds.

Then, take the discrete derivative to j-th direction and use Lemma 5.5 to get obtain |N uN (t, x)|  Ct-1/2 + CKt1/2

for some positive constant C, which holds true for every t  (0, T ]. In particular, we have |N uN (t, x)|  CK for every t  t and thus we complete the proof by combining with the
above estimate which holds for small time t  t.

Moreover, we have an L-estimate for second order discrete derivatives in the next Lemma 5.7. This is needed to estimate N (uN (t, x)) when applying the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle
for a possibly non-linear term which comes from the zero-range generator. The proof of Lemma
5.7 can be done analogously in [6]. Since it is complicated and the main idea is similar to that
of Lemma 5.6, we omit the proof here.

Lemma 5.7. There exists a positive constant C such that
|N t(N uN (t, x))|  CK3eCK2t
for every t  [0, T ] and x  TdN provided the assertion holds at time t = 0. In particular, there exists a positive constant C = C(T ) such that
|N (uN (t, x))|  CK3eCK2
for every t  [0, T ] and x  TdN .
In the proof of the L-estimate for first order derivatives given in Lemma 5.6, we used Duhamel's principle twice. This is because the fundamental solution pN (t, x, y) may not has the symmetry in spatial variables x and y in general. Indeed, since the heat kernel generated by usual Laplacian is symmetric in spatial variables, we can deduce an L-estimate by applying Duhamel's principle directly in the second equation of (3.1) for vN as follows.

Lemma 5.8. There exists a positive constant C such that

|N vN (t, x)|  -1/2K(C0 + Ct1/2)

for every t  [0, T ] and x  TdN provided the assertion holds at time t = 0.
Proof. Let pN0 (t, x, y) be the heat kernel corresponding to the discrete Laplacian N on TdN satisfying the derivative estimate given in Proposition 5.5. By applying Duhamel's principle to the second equation of (3.1), we have

t

vN (t, x) =

vN (0, y)pN0 (t, x, y) - K

uN (s, y)vN (s, y)pN0 ((t - s), x, y)ds

yTdN

0 yTdN

for every t  [0, T ] and x  TdN . Then, taking the discrete gradient for both sides to conclude that

y

|N vN (t, x)| 

|N vN (0, y)|pN0 (t, x, y) + CK

|N pN0 ((t - s), x, y)|ds.

yTdN

0 yTdN

Here we used the symmetry of the discrete heat kernel pN0 in spatial arguments to estimate the first term, while the second estimate can be deduced by the uniform boundedness of uN and vN (Lemma 5.2). Hence we complete the proof in view of the assumption and the derivative
estimate (5.4).

6. The multi-variable Boltzmann-Gibbs principle

In this section, we prove the multi-variable Boltzmann-Gibbs principle (Theorem 4.3), which is a crucial estimate to replace a multi-variable local function by a linear combination of rescaled variables 1 and 2. First we give the proof of the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle with some main ingredients at hand which are to be proved in forthcoming subsections. Several estimates for truncation (Lemmas 6.6 and 6.7) and main estimates for residual terms (Lemmas 6.8, 6.11 and 6.12) to prove the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle are given in Subsection 6.3 and 6.4, respectively. In the sequel, we fix a local function h with support in a finite square box h  TdN satisfying the bound (4.1). Recall here that for this local function h we defined its residual term R(x) = R(x, ) by
R(x) =xh(1, 2) - ~h(uN (t, x), vN (t, x))
- 1h~(uN (t, x), vN (t, x))(1(x) - uN (t, x))
- 2h~(uN (t, x), vN (t, x))(2(x) - vN (t, x)).

Throughout this section, we denote by i(x) = ||-1 z i(x + z) local averages in a box with width   N for each i = 1, 2 and x  TdN . Moreover, let

y1(x)

:=

y~2(x)

:=

be scaled local averages around a site x  TdN . We write y(x) = (y1(x), y2(x)) and y~(x) = (y~1(x), y~2(x)), and we define their norms by |y(x)| = |y1(x)|+|y2(x)| and |y~(x)| = |y~1(x)|+|y~2(x)|, for every x  TdN . We first give the proof of our Boltzmann-Gibbs principle.

Proof of Theorem 4.3. First we conduct a truncation procedure which enables us to focus on bounded type-1 configuration where there are finite numbers of particles on each site. By Lemma 6.6 and 6.7, we have

Now we decompose the summand in the last quantity as R1 + R2 + R3 where

R1(x) = R(x)1{ zh 1(x+z)A} - E [R(x)1{ zh 1(x+z)A}|1 (x), 2 (x)] 1{1 (x)B}, R2(x) = E [R(x)1{ zh 1(x+z)A}|1 (x), 2 (x)]1{1 (x)B}1{|y(x)|}, R3(x) = E [R(x)1{ zh 1(x+z)A}|1 (x), 2 (x)]1{1 (x)B}1{|y(x)|>}

with a sufficiently small positive constant . In forthcoming subsections, we give quantitative estimates for R1, R2 and R3 in Lemma 6.8, 6.11 and 6.12, respectively. Combining these

estimates altogether, there exists a positive constant C = C() such that

for sufficiently large N . Now we fix indices by 0 =  = A = 1 = d = 2 - ( + 2A + (d + 2) + 1 ) so that we may take 0 = d/(3d + 1). Therefore, we obtain

EµNt

(1(x) + 2(x)) = O(N d).

for every positive . However, since both zero-range processes have uniform exponential moment

with sufficiently small  with respect to equilibrium measures, the second term in the right-hand side of the above display has order O(N d). Thus we complete the proof recalling the assumption
H(µN0 |0N ) = O(N d).

Lemma 6.2. For every  > 0,  = (1, 2)  (0, ) × (0, 1) and t  0, we have H(µNt |) = H(µNt |tN ) + O(N d)
as N tends to infinity. In particular, H(µN0 |) = O(N d) if H(µN0 |0N ) = O(N d).

Proof. By definition of relative entropy, we have

H(µNt |) = H(µNt |tN ) +

Moreover, noting uniform boundedness of uN and vN by Lemma 5.2 and that the partition

However, our zero-range jump rate g satisfies g(k)  Ck by the assumption (LG), we have Z1  kZ+((1)/C)k/k! = e(1)/c  1 for every 1  0. Therefore, we obtain

so that EµNt [log d2N,t/d2] has order O(N d) and thus we complete the proof.

6.2. Spectral gap estimates. Next we give some preliminary results for spectral gaps. Before
that, we introduce the restriction of zero-range and Kawasaki processes on single component as follows. Let LoZ and LoK be generators corresponding to zero-range and Kawasaki dynamics with one species, respectively. Namely, for any f : XN1  R the zero-range generator LoZ acts as

LoZ f (1) =

g(1(x))[f (1x,y) - f (1)],

x,yTdN ,|x-y|=1

while the Kawasaki generator LoK acts for any f : XN2  R as

LoK f (2) =

2(x)(1 - 2(y))[f (2x,y) - f (2)].

x,yTdN ,|x-y|=1

For each   Z+, let  = [-, ]d  Zd and let LoZ, and LoK, be restriction of LoZ and LoK on , respectively, defined by

LoZ,f (1) =

g(1(x))[f (1x,y) - f (1)]

x,y,|x-y|=1

and

LoK,f (2) =

2(x)(1 - 2(y))[f (2x,y) - f (2)].

x,y,|x-y|=1

Given a weight u = {u(x) : x  }  R+, we denote the restriction on  of the product measure 1,u by 1,u,. When the weight is spatially homogeneous, i.e. u(x) = 1 for every

x  , we write 1,u, = 1,1, with abuse of notation. When there are j1 (j1  Z+) type-1

particles on , the canonical independent of 1, is invariant

the zero-range (resp. Kawasaki) generator acting on every real-valued functions on type-1 (resp.

type-2) configurations such that the total numbers of type-1 (resp. type-2) particles is j1 (resp.

j2).

Proposition 6.3 ([14]). Assume the jump rate g satisfies (LG). Then there exists a positive

constant C such that the zero-range generator LoZ,,j satisfies a spectral gap estimate with inten-

Note that when the small parameter (N ) tends to zero, the spectral gap for our Kawasaki dynamics diverges. Since our diffusion dynamics generated by N 2LZ + (N )LK is governed by both zero-range dynamics for type-1 particles and Kawasaki dynamics for type-2 particles, we
get a spectral gap estimate by combining the above result for Kawasaki and zero-range dynamics.

Lemma 6.5. We fix any   Z+ and (j1, j2)  Z2+. Let 1 be a spectral gap for the zero-range generator LoZ,,j1 and let 2 be a spectral gap for the Kawasaki generator LoK,,j2. Then, the generator LZ,,j1 + LK,,j2 satisfies a spectral gap estimate with intensity (21 + 2-12)-1.

Proof. We take an arbitrary function f : XN  R. We abbreviate the parameter  = (1, 2) and   N here, and recall that our reference measure has a product form  = 1  2 with this convention. By an elementary inequality (a + b)2  2a2 + 2b2 for a, b  R, we have

Var1,j1 2,j2 [f ]  2E1,j1 2,j2 [(f - E1,j1 [f ])2] + 2E1,j1 2,j2 [(E1,j1 [f ] - E1,j1 2,j2 [f ])2]. Since the zero-range generator satisfies a spectral gap estimate with intensity 1-1, the first term in the above display can be bounded above by

21E2,j2 [ f, -LZ,,j1f ] L2(1,j1 ) = 21 f, -LZ,,j1f . L2(1,j1 2,j2 )
On the other hand, due to a spectral gap estimate for Kawasaki dynamics, the second term can be bounded above by
2-12 E1.j1 [f ], -LK,,j2E1,j1 [f ] L2(2,j2 )  2-12 f, -LK,,j2f . L2(1,j1 2,j2 )
Here in the last estimate we used Jensen's inequality noting the Dirichlet energy for Kawasaki dynamics f  f, -LK,,j1f L2(2) is a convex functional which can be deduced from convexity of quadratic functions. Hence we obtain the desired spectral gap estimate for total generator LZ,,j1 + LK,,j2 and complete the proof.
We write LZ,,x,j1 := LZ,,x,j1x and LK,,x,j1 := LK,,x,j1x where {x}xZd is a shift acting for any real-valued function f on XN as xf (·) = f (x·) where x(z) = (x + z) for every   XN . Note here that spectral gap is not affected by spatial shifts since our dynamics is translationinvariant. Hence for any   Z+, x  TdN and (j1, j2)  Z2+, due to the above lemmas, we see that our diffusion dynamics generated by LZ,,x,j1 + LK,,x,j2 has a spectral gap with intensity

where in the second estimate we decomposed TdN into |h| regular sublattices {z(|h|1/d/N Z)d; z  h} and applied H¨older's inequality. Furthermore, using an elementary inequality log(1 + x)  x for x  0 and then Markov's inequality, the second term in the last
display can be bounded from above by

However, since supx EtN yh 1(x + y)e|h| |R(x)| stays finite for sufficiently small  which is independent of N , the last quantity has order O(N dA-1) and thus we complete the proof.

Lemma 6.7. Let B = BN = N B with a positive constant B and let  be a positive integer. Then there exists a positive constant C such that

Proof. Since the local function h satisfies the bound (4.1), we see that |R(x)|1{ yh 1(x+y)A} has order O(A) as N tends to infinity. Therefore, applying Markov's inequality to the indicator function 1{1(x)>B}, the left-hand side of the assertion can be bounded from above by

with some positive constant C. However, noting an identity x 1(x) = x 1(x), Lemma 6.1 for the total number of particles finishes the proof.

6.4. Main estimates.

6.4.1. Estimate of R1. First we give an quantitative estimate for R1 by using a spectral gap estimate.

Lemma 6.8. Assume H(µN0 |0N ) = O(N d). Let  = N  and 1 = N 1 for positive constants  and 1. Suppose  + A + 1 + (d + 2) - 2 < 0 holds true. Then we have

for any positive constant 1. Since H(µN0 |) = O(KN d) provided H(µN0 |0N ) = O(N d) by Lemma 6.2, only the second term is concerned. According to an elementary estimate e|z|  ez + e-z for every z  R and the Feynman-Kac formula, the second term in the last display is
bounded from above by

where h is a density with respect to . Moreover, DN ( h) = DN ( h; ) is a Dirichlet energy

of h with respect to the probability measure  and a symmetric quadratic form DN is defined

by

DN (f ) := f, -LN f L2() = f, -SN f L2(), SN = (LN + LN, )/2

for every real-valued functions f on XN . Hereafter we fix an arbitrary non-negative function f on XN such that f 2 is density with respect to  to bound the supremum in (6.1). Since our dynamics is a superposition of diffusion and reaction dynamics, DN is decomposed into sum of three terms N 2DZ + (N )N 2DK + K(N )DG where

E (f (1, 2x,y) - f (1, 2))2 ,

and DG(f ) := f, -LGf L2() can be calculated as

DG(f ) = - E 1(x)2(x)f (1, 2)(f (1x,-, 2x) - f (1, 2))

To analyze further, let LZ,,x and LK,,x be the zero-range and the Kawasaki generators restricted on a block ,x = x + [-, ]d  Zd, which are defined by

LZ,,xf (1, 2) =

g(1(y)) f (1y,z, 2) - f (1, 2) ,

y,z,x,|y-z|=1

LK,,xf (1, 2) =

2(y)(1 - 2(z)) f (1, 2y,z) - f (1, 2)

y,z,x,|y-z|=1

for every real-valued functions f on XN . Then, the associated Dirichlet energy DZ,,x(f ; ) = f, -LZ,,xf L2() and DK,,x(f ;  ) = f, -LK,,xf L2() become to be

DZ,,x(f ; )

y,z,x,|y-z|=1

Here we denote by D := DZ + DK the Dirichlet energy corresponding to our diffusion dynamics and we define D,x := DZ,,x + DK,,x. Counting the overlaps, we observe

D,x(f ; ) = (2 + 1)dD(f ; )
xTdN

for every   N. Therefore, the supremum in (6.2) can be bounded from above by

Cgap(, j1, j2)-1A2

noting R1(x)  = O(A) by definition. As a consequence of Lemma 6.5, we have gap(, j1, j2)-1  C-12. Now we choose indices in order that  + A + 1 + (d + 2) - 2 < 0 holds. Then

R1(x) 1(2 + 1)dN -2gap(, j1, j2)-1  CA1dgap(, j1, j2)-1N -2 = oN (1)

as N tends to infinity so that the denominator in (6.3) is bounded from below by a positive
constant which is independent of N . Hence the display (6.3) can be bounded from above by C-11N -2d+2A2 and combining all the above estimates we complete the proof.

6.4.2. Estimate of R2. We give an estimate for R2 = R2(x).

Lemma 6.9. There exists a positive constant C such that E [R(x)1{ zh 1(x+z)A}|1 (x), 2 (x)] 1{|y(x)|}  C|y(x)|21{|y(x)|} + C-d + CA-1eC1K holds true for every x  TdN .

Proof. With the help of the equivalence of ensembles (Corollary A.1.7. in [13]), when |y(x)|  

we have

E [R(x)1{ yh 1(x+y)A}|1 (x), 2 (x)]



E [R(x)1 (uN (t,x),vN (t,x))+y(x)

{

yh 1(x+y)A}] + C -d.

Recall here that the measure (uN (t,x),vN (t,x))+y(x) = (1 (x),2(x)) is a product measure with spatially homogeneous weight (1(x), 2 (x)). We choose `chemical potentials' 1 = 1(y1(x))

and 2 = 2(y2(x)) by

E(uN (t,x),vN (t,x)) [1(x)e1(1(x)-uN (t,x))] E [e ] (uN (t,x),vN (t,x)) 1(1(x)-uN (t,x))

=

uN (t, x) + y1(x),

E(uN (t,x),vN (t,x)) [2(x)e2(2(x)-vN (t,x))] E [e ] (uN (t,x),vN (t,x)) 2(2(x)-vN (t,x))

=

vN (t, x) + y2(x).

Then for each i = 1, 2, one can notice dyi(x)/di  0 so that there is a one-to-one correspondence
between yi and i. In particular, we have yi(x)|i=0 = 0 by definition, which deduces i(0) = 0 for each i = 1, 2. Moreover, we see that

1(0)

=

d1 (0) dy1(x)

=

E(uN (t,x),vN (t,x)) [(1(x) - uN (t, x))2]-1

and similarly for type-2 configuration. In particular, we have 1(0) = 1(uN (t, x))-1 and 2(0) = 2(vN (t, x))-1 where 1(1) = (1)/(1) (1  0) and 2(2) = 2(1 - 2) (0  2  1) are incompressibility for zero-range and exclusion processes, respectively. Let b(x) = R(x)1{ zh 1(x+z)A}. Then, a direct computation shows

 y1(x) E(uN (t,x),vN (t,x))+y(x)[b(x)]

y(x)=0

=

EtN [b(x)(1(x)

uN (t, x))]/1(uN (t, x)),

y(x)=0

=

EtN [b(x)(2(x)

-

vN (t, x))]/2(vN (t, x)).

Now the Taylor expansion around y(x) = (0, 0) enables us to write

E [b(x)] (uN (t,x),vN (t,x))+y(x) =E(uN (t,x),vN (t,x)) [b(x)]

In the sequel, we estimate the expectations appearing in the last display to finish the proof. For the first term, since R(x) has mean zero with respect to tN for every x  TdN , we can easily see that there exists a positive constant C such that

|E(uN (t,x),vN (t,x)) [b(x)]| = - E(uN (t,x),vN (t,x)) [R(x)1{ zh 1(x+z)>A}]

where we used Markov's inequality in the penultimate estimate, and the last estimate can be deduced since moments of any order is bounded uniformly in N . On the other hand, due to a similar calculation given above, we have

However, since 1(uN (t, x))-1 = (uN (t, x))/(uN (t, x))  CeC1K in view of the uniform lower bound for uN by Lemma 5.2, the last display can be bounded by CA-1eC1K. Similarly for type-2 configuration, we obtain

Since type-2 particles satisfy the exclusion rule, recalling |y~(x)| = |y~1(x)| + |y~2(x)| and 1{|y~(x)}  1{|y~1(x)} for each x  TdN , it suffices to show the assertion only for type-1 configuration. However, such a result for single species model is already proved in [6] so that we omit
the proof here. With these lemmas at hand, we can estimate R2 as follows.

Now our task is to bound the second term in the last display. For that purpose, it is convenient to replace y(x) in the indicator function 1{|y(x)|} by y~(x) as

1{|y(x)|} = 1{|y(x)|} 1{|y~(x)|2} + 1{|y~(x)|>2}  1{|y~(x)|2} + 1{|y(x)|}1{|y~(x)|>2}  1{|y~(x)|2} + 1{|y(x)|} 1{|y(x)|>} + 1{|y(x)-y~(x)|} = 1{|y~(x)|2} + 1{|y(x)|}1{|y(x)-y~(x)|}.
In particular, we have y~(x)21{|y(x)|}1{|y(x)-y~(x)|}  2 y(x)2 + (y(x) - y~(x))2 1{|y(x)|}1{|y(x)-y~(x)|}  221{|y(x)-y~(x)|} + 2(y(x) - y~(x))2  4(y(x) - y~(x))2

where we used Markov's inequality for the last line. Therefore, according to the energy estimate given in Lemma 5.4, we deduce for some positive constant C that

is bounded uniformly in   N by Lemma 6.10 for small , . Since  can be taken as a constant independent of  and N , we obtain the assertion and complete the proof.

where gi(y, 2(x)) (i = 1, 2) denote polynomials of 2(x) obtained by substituting 2(x) into all argument {2(z); z  h} and in the second line we used the uniform boundedness of uN and vN (Lemma 5.2) to replace 1(x) by y~1(x). Moreover, in view of Lemma 5.2, noting g1(y) and g2(y) are polynomials of {2(z); z  h}, which are uniformly bounded, we see that there exists a positive constant C such that

7. Convergence results for semi-discretized system (3.1)
In this section we give a proof of Theorem 3.2. Throughout this section, let uN and vN be a solution of the system (3.1) with initial functions satisfying the assumptions (A1) and (A3) which are extended on Td by (3.2). First we show the uniqueness of the problem (2.1) in a similar way as [10].

Lemma 7.1. The problem (2.1) has at most one solution.
Proof. Let w1, w2  L(QT ) be two solutions of the problem (2.1) with a common initial function. Subtracting the weak forms of w1 and w2 with each other, we have

-

D(w1) - D(w2) · ddt = 0

(7.1)

where the function D is defined by D(s) = (s)1[0,), which is non-decreasing on R. Now we take a test function  defined by

(t, ) =

D(w1) - D(w2) (, )d

in (7.1).

Then, noting a simple relation f (t) ·

Here, the first term of the left-hand side of the last display stays non-negative since the function

D is non-decreasing on R so that it becomes to be zero. Hence we have w1 = w2 and complete the proof.

Next we show the compactness of the discretized solutions uN and vN .

Lemma 7.2. The sequence {uN (t, )}NN is relatively compact in Lp(QT ) for any p  2.

Proof. By the Fr´echet-Kolmogorov theorem ([1], Theorem IV.25 and Corollary IV.26), it suffices to show that there exists a positive constant C such that

T -
|uN (t + , ) - uN (t, )|pddt  C,

|uN (t,  + ) - uN (t, )|pddt  C||

for all p  2,   (0, T ) and   Rd sufficiently small.
First we show the equi-continuity along spatial direction with exponent p = 1. Once the case when p = 1 is proved, then we obtain the assertion for any exponent p  1 according to the uniform boundedness of uN (Lemma 5.2). Change of variables enables us to restrict our cases
for non-negative . In this case, we observe

for every t  [0, T ], n  Z+ and r  1. Combining these two estimates and applying them for  = n/rN with n = N  and r = N /N to obtain

for every t  [0, T ] and   0 where in the last estimate we used H¨older's inequality. According to the uniform energy estimate Lemma 5.4, we obtain the equi-continuity in spatial variables for any index p  1. In particular, the second assertion holds for any p  2.
Similarly, we next prove the equi-continuity in time only for the case p = 2. We remark here that when 1  p < 2 another exponent for  is needed so that we restrict our cases only for p  2. The integral appearing in the left hand side of the first estimate for p = 2 is equal to

However, using the first equation of (3.1) for the integrand and integrating by parts, this quantity can be estimated from above by

where we used Schwarz's inequality to estimate the first and the second terms. Furthermore,

note here that the mean-value theorem enables us to write jN (uN (t, x)) = (u~j)jN uN (t, x) with some u~j between uN (t, x + ej) and uN (t, x) for every j = 1, . . . , d, t  [0, T ] and x  TdN . Since uN takes values in a finite interval, the first and the second terms in the above display can

be estimated by the L2-energy of N uN . The third term can also be estimated by  in view of

Lemma 5.3. By this line, we could bound the above sum of three terms by  with some positive

constant and the desired estimate was proved.

Moreover, we have the following weak compactness of the sequence {vN }. The next result
is obvious since any bounded sequence of a reflective Banach space has a weakly convergent subsequence and the functions vN have a uniform bound in N and so do their Lp-norms for
p > 1.

Lemma 7.3. The sequence {vN (t, )}NN is weakly pre-compact in Lp(QT ) for any p > 1. Namely, there exists a subsequence (Nk) and v  Lp(QT ) such that vN  v weakly in Lp(QT ).

Now we give a proof of Theorem 3.2.

Proof of Theorem 3.2. For any p > 1, by Lemma 7.2 the sequence {uN (t, )}NN is strongly precompact in Lp(QT ), while by Lemma 7.3 {vN (t, )}NN is weakly precompact in Lp(QT ). Therefore, there exist a subsequence {Nk} and functions u, v  Lp(QT ) such that
uNk  u strongly in Lp(QT ), vNk  v weakly in Lp(QT )

for any p > 1. In particular, by taking further subsequences if necessary (which again denoted by Nk), we see that uNk  u a.e. in QT , which clearly take values in [0, Mu] × [0, Mv]. We show the function u belongs to L2(0, T ; H1(Td)). For any test function   C(Td), j = 1, . . . , d and
t  [0, T ], we have

uN (t, )jN ()d = - ()jN uN (t, )d

G()] for every continuous functions G on Td. Taking limit along (Nk) on the above identity,

we see that jN uN converges to the j-th partial derivative ju in distributional sense for every

j = 1, . . . , d. Moreover, since L2(Td)-norm of the discrete derivative jN uN (t, ·) is bounded above

by some constant independent of N in view of Lemma 5.4, ju(t, ·) belongs to L2(Td) for every

j = 1, . . . , d and thus we obtain u  L2(0, T ; H1(Td)). Moreover, by the second equation of

(3.1), we have

QT

uN (t, )vN (t, )ddt

for every N  N. Since uNk  u strongly in L2(QT ) and vNk  v weakly in L2(QT ) as k tends to infinity, their product uNk vNk converges strongly in L1(QT ) to uv. Therefore, taking limit

along (Nk) on the above bound, we get uv = 0 a.e. in QT . Next we let wN := uN - vN and we denote its extension as a simple function on Td (see

(3.2)) by the same notation. Note here that it is already shown that the sequence (wN ) on QT converges weakly in L2(QT ) to some w along the subsequence (Nk). We show any limit point

w satisfies (2.2). For that purpose, we subtract the two equations in (3.1) with each other to

cancel singular reaction terms. Let  be an arbitrary smooth function with compact support on

QT satisfying (T, ·)  0 on Td. Then, for every t  [0, T ] and  = (j)j=1,...,d  Td, we multiply

which vanishes as N tends to infinity due to the energy estimate (Lemma 5.4). Now recalling the functions {uN (t, )}NN is relatively compact according to Lemma 7.2, we take the limit of scaling parameters along the subsequence (Nk). Then we obtain the desired weak form (2.2) for every   H1(QT ) such that (T, ·)  0 noting the space of smooth functions on QT with compact support is dense in H1(QT ). Finally, the uniqueness of the problem (2.1) assures that the above convergence holds without taking any subsequence and thus we complete the proof.
