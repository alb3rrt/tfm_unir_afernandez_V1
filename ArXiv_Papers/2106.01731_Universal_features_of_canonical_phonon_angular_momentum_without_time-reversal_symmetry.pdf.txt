It is known that phonons have angular momentum, and when the time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is broken, the total phonon angular momentum in the whole system becomes nonzero. In this paper, we propose that as an angular momentum of phonons for a crystal without TRS, we need to consider the canonical angular momentum, as opposed to the kinetic angular momentum in previous works. Next, we show that the angular momentum of phonons without TRS exhibits universal behaviors near the  point. We focus on in-plane oscillations in two-dimensional crystals as an example. By breaking the TRS, one of the acoustic phonon branches at the  point acquires a gap. We show that the angular momentum of its acoustic phonon with a gap has a peak with the height ± regardless of the details of the system. From this, we find that this peak height changes discontinuously by changing the sign of the TRS-breaking parameter.

I. INTRODUCTION
Phonons are quasiparticles which carry heat in solids. Many studies on phonons have been conducted on systems with time-reversal symmetry (TRS). In recent years, the phonon Hall effect (PHE) has been observed experimentally [1]. The PHE is a phenomenon in which under a magnetic field, a temperature gradient induces a heat flow in a direction perpendicular to both the temperature gradient and the magnetic field. From such experiments, phonons in systems with broken TRS have attracted attention in recent years. Furthermore, the PHE has been studied theoretically [2­7] and experimentally [1, 8­10] from a topological point of view, similar to the electron Hall effect.
On the other hand, one can introduce a phonon angular momentum due to the vibration of the atoms inside the crystal [11]. The phonon angular momentum vanishes in systems with TRS in equilibrium. In a system with TRS but without inversion symmetry, the phonon angular momentum becomes zero in the entire system, but the phonon angular momentum in each mode has a nonzero value. In particular, the phonon angular momentum is nonzero at the valleys in the momentum space. These phonons at the valleys are called chiral phonons [12] and have been observed experimentally [13]. Furthermore, in a system without inversion symmetry, the phonon angular momentum of the entire system can be generated by a temperature gradient [14]. On the other hand, in a system without TRS, the entire system has a nonzero phonon angular momentum [11]. One can break the TRS for phonons by the Lorentz force [15, 16], the Coriolis force [17], and spin-phonon interaction [4, 18, 19]. When these effects break the TRS and the phonon angular momentum of the entire system acquires a nonzero value, it may contribute to the Einstein­de Haas effect [11, 20]. Furthermore, methods for generating phonon angular momentum have been studied from various perspectives [11, 14, 21, 22]. In addition, various related subjects such as spin relaxation [23­25], orbital mag-

netization of phonons [26­28], and conversion between magnons and phonons [29, 30] have also been studied.
As explained above, the phonon angular momentum for a system without TRS is important in understanding the Einstein­de Haas effect. In this paper, we first formulate the angular momentum of phonons for a crystal without TRS. Here, we point out that one can define two angular momenta, a canonical angular momentum and a kinetic angular momentum. We propose that we need to consider the canonical one, as opposed to previous works, because the canonical one is conserved. Next, we show that the angular momentum of acoustic phonons in systems without TRS exhibits universal behaviors near the  point. For this purpose, we consider in-plane oscillations in a two-dimensional crystal. As an example, we calculate the phonon band structure and the phonon angular momentum of a kagome-lattice model without TRS by applying a magnetic field and Lorentz force. By breaking TRS, one of the acoustic phonon branches acquires a gap at the  point, while the other remains gapless. In the kagome-lattice model, the phonon angular momentum has a peak equal to ± at the  point, and this peak changes discontinuously between ± across the magnetic field h = 0. We show that these behaviors of the angular momentum of the acoustic phonon near the  point are universal properties that do not depend on the details of the system.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we review the eigenequation of the TRS-breaking phonons. In Sec. III, we formulate the canonical angular momentum of phonons for a crystal without TRS and discuss its difference from the kinetic angular momentum. In Sec. V, first, using a kagome-lattice model as an example, we explain that the angular momentum of the acoustic phonon with a gap has a peak with the height ± at the  point, and this peak changes discontinuously between ± by changing the sign of the TRS-breaking parameter. Using an effective Hamiltonian, we explain the universal property of acoustic phonons near the  point when the TRS-breaking effect is small. In Sec. VI, we summarize

this paper.

II. TRS-BREAKING PHONONS

In this section, we review the eigenvalue problem for phonons when the TRS is broken, following Ref. [2, 7]. We begin with a Lagrangian for phonons in a crystal in the harmonic approximation:

1 L0 = 2

u Tl u l

-

1 2

uTl Kl,l ul

(1)

l

l,l

where ul = (ul,1, ul,2, · · · , ul,n)T, ul,b is a displacement vector of the bth atom in the lth unit cell multiplied by

the square root of the mass of the atom, n is the number

of atoms in the unit cell, and Kl,l is a mass-weighted force constant matrix. From this Lagrangian, we get

the eigenequation of the phonon:

D(k)

k,

= 2
k,

k, ,

where D(k) = l Kl,l ei(Rl -Rl)·k is the dynamical matrix, k, is the eigenfrequency, and k, is the eigenstate

of the eigenequation in the wave vector k, specified by the

mode index  = 1, 2, · · · , N . Here N is the dimension of

the vector ul, and is given by N = nd, where d is the dimension of the atomic displacement considered. This

eigenequation of the phonon assumes TRS [31].

The TRS-breaking effect is treated by adding the term

L = l,l u Tl Al,l ul to the Lagrangian L0 [2]. Accord-
ing to Ref. [2], L = l,l u Tl Al,l ul is the only harmonic term allowed when breaking the TRS for L0, where Al,l

is a real matrix. Furthermore, the symmetric part of L

does not contribute to the motion because it can be writ-

ten

as

the

time

derivative

of

1 2

l,l uTl ASl,l ul and con-

tributes only a constant to the action S = Ldt. There-

fore, when breaking the TRS of L0, we consider only L = l,l u Tl Al,l ul , where A is a real antisymmetric matrix. The physical origins of the TRS-breaking term

for lattice vibration are the Lorentz force of charged ions

[15], spin-phonon interaction in magnetic materials [4],

and the Coriolis force with rotation [16, 17]. In this pa-

per, we consider that the Lorentz force breaks the TRS

of charged ions in a lattice. In this case, (Al,l)b,b =

qb 2mb

 B, and the other elements are zero, where

mb and qb are the mass and the charge of the bth atom;

 is the Levi-Civita symbol; , ,  run over x, y, z;

and B is the magnetic field in the  direction. From

the Lagrangian L = L0 + L , the eigenequation without

TRS becomes D(k)

k, - 2ik,A

A is a real antisymmetric matrix. This equation is not

a generalized eigenproblem. Therefore, we can make it a

generalized eigenproblem by rewriting it as

This equation is called the Schr¨odinger-like equation of

phonons because it is Hermitian. We call H(k) the

Hamiltonian in the following.

The dimension of H(k) is double the dimension N of

the dynamical matrix D(k). Since H(k) = -H(-k),

the eigenvalues k, and the eigenvectors k, at the

wavevector k can be labeled to satisfy k, = --k,-

and


k,

-k,- ,

where

a

-N, · · · , -2, -1, 1, 2, · · · , N . Therefore, there is one-to-

one correspondence between the modes with negative fre-

quencies and those with positive frequencies. Because

these two modes forming a pair represent one physical

mode, we need to consider only the modes with posi-

tive frequencies in order to study their physical prop-

erties. The normalization condition for the eigenstates

is

III. PHONON ANGULAR MOMENTUM WITHOUT TRS

In this section, we first explain the angular momentum of phonons [11]. Next, we formulate the angular momentum of phonons without TRS. The angular momentum of atoms in a crystal can be split into the mechanical angular momentum of the crystal as a rigid body and the angular momentum of the vibration of the atoms around their equilibrium position, and the latter is called phonon angular momentum. We define the angular momentum of the vibration of the atoms in the crystal as

J = ulb × plb,

(5)

lb

where plb is a canonical momentum of the bth atom in

the lth unit cell, divided by the square root of the mass

of the atom. The canonical momentum without TRS is

pl

=

L ul

= u l + Aul ,

where

pl

=

(pl,1, pl,2, · · · , pl,n)T.

In Ref. [11], the angular momentum of phonons is de-

fined by J kin = lb ulb × u lb, and precisely speaking, this should be called kinetic angular momentum when

the TRS is broken. Because the canonical angular mo-

mentum J is conservative but the kinetic one Jkin is not,

we consider the canonical one in this paper. We note

that the matrix A has a gauge degree of freedom, and the

addition of any constant symmetric matrix to A leaves

3

the equation of motion invariant. One may wonder if

such a gauge degree of freedom exists also in the canon-

ical angular momentum. In Appendix B, we discuss the

gauge degree of freedom for a free charged particle in

constant magnetic field B along the z axis. We show

that the canonical angular momentum along the z axis

is conserved only for a symmetric gauge with the vector

potential

A

=

1 2

(-By,

Bx,

0)

and

not

conserved

for

other

gauges. Thus, in the discussion of the canonical angular

momentum, we should fix the gauge to be a symmetric

gauge. In the present paper, we also adopt the symmetric

gauge, which corresponds to the gauge with the matrix

A

being

antisymmetric:

(Al,l)b,b

=

qb 2mb

  B

For simplicity, we focus on an in-plane oscillation in a

two-dimensional crystal in the xy plane. As shown in Ap-

pendix A, the canonical angular momentum of phonons

without TRS of the whole crystal in the z direction is

expressed as

1

Jz =

lk, f (k,) + 2 ,

(6)

k,>0

lk, =



i M + AM

k,

k

k, ,

(7)

where f (k,) = 1/(e k,/kBT - 1) is the Bose distribution function, T is the temperature, kB is Boltzmann's constant, is Planck's constant, lk, is the angular mo-

mentum of a phonon of branch  at wave vector k, k, is a normalized eigenvector for the displacement vector,

and M = In×n 

0 -i i0

.

In contrast to Eq. (7),

in Ref. [11], the angular momentum of a phonon is de-

fined by lkin =
k,

M
k,

k, ,

which

is

the

kinetic

angu-

lar momentum without TRS. Therefore, the canonical

angular momentum in Eq. (7) has an additional term,

i k

 AM
k,

k,, which makes the behavior of the angu-

lar momentum of acoustic phonons very different from

previous studies when TRS is broken.

IV. MODEL CALCULATION
In this section, we calculate the phonon angular momentum of the kagome-lattice model without TRS as an example, and we discuss the temperature dependence of the phonon angular momentum. To break the TRS, we calculate phonons in a model where atoms with electric charges form a kagome lattice and a magnetic field is applied in the out-of-plane direction. The model is the same as the one studied in Ref. [11], but the change in the definition of the angular momentum leads to different results from Ref. [11]. At each of the three sublattices of the kagome-lattice model, we put atoms A, B, and C, depending on the sublattice. Let the masses and the charges of atoms be mi and qi (i = A, B, C), respectively. When the TRS is broken by the Lorentz force under the

The magnetic field h is (a) h = 0.02, (b) h = 0, and (c) h = -0.02. The colors of the curves represent the modes, and the black curves in (a-2), (b-2), and (c-2) represent the total angular momentum. The inset in (b-1) shows the schematic pictures of the model, and that in (b-2) shows its Brillouin zone.

We use the matrix A to calculate its dispersion relation and angular momentum in a kagome lattice, and the result is shown in Fig. 1. In the calculation, we use the following values of the parameters: the longitudinal spring constant KL = 0.144, the transverse one KT = KL/4, the lattice constant a = 1, and the charge and mass of atoms A, B, C are mA = mB = mC = 1, qA = qB = qC = -1. The magnetic field h in the z direction is varied as h = -0.02, 0, 0.02.

V. PHONON ANGULAR MOMENTUM AT THE  POINT
In this section, we show that the angular momentum of the acoustic phonon near the  point shows a universal behavior that does not depend on the details of the system. First, as an example, we calculate the phonon angular momentum of the kagome-lattice model without TRS, and we show that the angular momentum of the acoustic phonon shows a characteristic behavior.

4

As can be seen from Fig. 1, by adding a magnetic field,
one of the two acoustic phonons with  = 2 and k = 0 acquires a gap at the  point. In addition, the angular momentum of this acoustic phonon is ± . When the magnetic field h is changed from negative to positive, this angular momentum l,2 changes discontinuously from - to across the magnetic field h = 0. Such a discontinuous change in the angular momentum is unexpected because an infinitesimal value of h leads to a jump of the phonon angular momentum up to ± . As shown in Appendix C, this behavior of the angular momentum of acoustic phonons at the  point holds in various systems in addition to the kagome-lattice model. We note that similar calculations were performed for various modes in Ref. [11], and the jump can be seen in Ref. [11]. Nevertheless, the universality of the jump has not been noticed previously. From now on, we show that this behavior is a universal property that does not depend on the details of the system.
We consider the behavior of acoustic phonons near the  point when a TRS-breaking term is added to the phonon system. The Schr¨odinger-like equation of phonons with the TRS is

H0 = ,

(10)

As mentioned above, for simplicity we focus on twodimensional systems, with only the in-plane displacements. Such a system has two acoustic phonon modes. Accordingly, this eigenequation has four eigenvectors with  = 0. Their eigenvectors i(i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are independent of the details of the system and are given by

where mi is the mass of the atom (i = 1, · · · , n) in the unit cell. The forms of the eigenvectors are universal because they are Goldstone modes. To consider the behavior of the acoustic phonons near the  point when the TRS-breaking effect is small, we consider an effective 4 × 4 matrix for the Hamiltonian projected onto these

four eigenvectors:

 1H(k)1 1H(k)2 1H(k)3 1H(k)4

We introduce k = kn, k = |k| and  = 1A0 2 where  represents the magnitude of the TRS breaking. To
describe the phonons near the  point when the TRS-
breaking effect is small, we expand Eq. (13) up to linear
order terms with respect to , k. We get

where an, bn, and cn depend only on n and not on k. One can directly show that an, bn are real because D(k)1/2 is a Hermitian matrix. Furthermore, as we show in Ap-
pendix E, cn is also real. We note that in the calculation of Eq. (14) in Appendix E, the key step is how to cal-
culate D(k)1/2. Due to a singularity of k = 0, we need

to separate the k dependence into k and n, by which we

can safely take the square root of D(k). In addition, we

define the eigenvalues of Eq. (14) as k,2, k,1, k,-1, and k,-2, starting with the larger eigenvalue.
Assuming  > 0, the eigenvector of the acous-

tic phonon with positive frequency ,2 = 2 is

(0, 0, 1 , i )T.

Thus, this state represents the circular motions of all the

VI. CONCLUSION

CSFBL534

FIG. 2. Schematic picture of acoustic phonons when TRS is broken. When TRS is broken, one phonon has a positive frequency (,2), two phonons have zero frequencies (,1, ,-1), and one phonon has a negative frequency (,-2) at the  point.

This indicates that the angular momentum l,2 changes discontinuously ± with respect to the parameter ,

which represents the magnitude of the TRS breaking.

Then this value is universal and independent of the de-

tails of the system. On the other hand, the other two

eigenvectors composed of 1 and 2 remain at  = 0 even without TRS. This behavior of the frequencies is

schematically shown in Fig. 2. The schematic picture in

Fig. 2 agrees with the model calculation in Fig. 1. Nor-

mally, one acoustic mode is gapped, while the other is

gapless.

In the following, we physically interpret the value of

the canonical angular momentum l,2 = for the gapped

mode at k = 0 for the acoustic phonon with the positive

frequency for  > 0. In the acoustic phonons at the

 point, relative positions of the atoms do not change.

Therefore, the springs between the atoms are not effec-

tive, and the motion is essentially the same as that of a

free charged particle in a magnetic field. In the present

case, it is the cyclotron motion of a positive charge within

the xy plane, which is a simple and well-studied problem.

As presented in detail in Appendix D, in quantum me-

chanics, the motion is described in terms of two kinds of

bosons, the a^ boson, with a positive frequency C (cyclotron frequency) and a canonical angular momentum

+ , and the ^b boson, with zero frequency and a canoni-

cal angular momentum - . These two bosons agree with

the gapped mode and gapless mode in our calculations,

respectively. Indeed, in agreement with the a^ boson, the

gapped mode has a canonical angular momentum for

 > 0, which corresponds to the positively charged parti-

cle in Appendix C. On the other hand, the gapless mode

has

a

canonical

angular

momentum

- a2n+bn2 +2cn2
2an bn -2cn2

, which

is not equal to the one for the ^b boson. This difference

may be attributed to hybridization between the k,1 and k,-1 branches at the  point. We also remark on the kinetic angular momentum. We can calculate the kinetic

angular momentum of phonons for the gapped and gap-

less modes to be 2 and 0, respectively. These values

is again in complete agreement with results for the cy-

clotron motion of a free particle, as explained in Ap-

pendix D.

In this paper, we introduced a definition for the angular momentum of phonons without TRS modified from the one in Ref. [11], and we showed that the angular momentum of acoustic phonons near the  point without TRS shows universal behaviors that do not depend on the details of the system. First, we pointed out that in the absence of TRS, apart from the kinetic angular momentum of phonons adopted in Ref. [11], another angular momentum can be defined, called the canonical angular momentum of phonons. Because the latter is conservative but the former is not, we considered the canonical angular momentum of phonons without TRS. As an example, we calculated the band structure and angular momentum of phonons in a model of the kagome lattice under magnetic field, which breaks the TRS. From this calculation, it was shown that the angular momentum of the acoustic phonon without TRS has a peak with a height at the  point. The peak height changes sign when the sign of the magnetic field changes. From these calculations, we predicted that the behavior of the angular momentum of the acoustic phonons near the  point without TRS is universal, and we showed that that is, indeed, the case.
In order to prove the prediction for a general system, we introduced an effective Hamiltonian for phonons near the  point with a small TRS-breaking effect. Using this effective Hamiltonian, we showed that the acoustic phonon of the  point with the breaking of TRS represents the circular motion of all the atoms in the same phase, and its angular momentum is ± . From this, we showed that this peak changes discontinuously by changing the sign of the TRS-breaking parameter.

which is Eqs. (6) and (7) in the main text.

Appendix B: Canonical angular momentum of a free charged particle

In this appendix, we explain that the canonical angular momentum of a free charged particle moving in the xy plane in a static magnetic field in the z direction is conservative only in a symmetric gauge. The Lagrangian of a free charged particle is

L = m x 2 + q x · A(x),

2

c

(B1)

where x = (x, y) is the position vector of the particle, m and q are the mass and the charge of the particle, and A(x) is the vector potential. Here the vector potential for the magnetic field B in the z direction is given by

1 A(x) =
2

-B +  B+

x y

,

(B2)

where  is a real constant representing the gauge degree

of freedom.

By using Eq. (B1), the canonical momentum is

p

L x

,

and

the

canonical

angular

momentum

is

J = x × p. It is written as J = m(xy - yx ) +

q 2c

h(x2 + y2) + (x2 - y2) .

By using the equation of

motion:

B,

the

time

derivative

of

the

canon-

ical angular momentum J is

dJ q = (xx - yy) · .
dt c

(B3)

Therefore, the canonical angular momentum in the static field is conservative only in  = 0, that is, in a symmet-
ric gauge. Thus, while the vector potential A(x) allows a gauge degree of freedom, the canonical angular momentum should be defined in the symmetric gauge. As in the case of a single charge, we define the canonical phonon angular momentum only in a symmetric gauge.

Appendix C: Model calculation of the phonon angular momentum
In this appendix, as mentioned in Sec. V we calculate various systems to confirm that the angular momentum of the acoustic phonon at the  point, which acquires a gap through the TRS breaking, does not depend on the details of the system. We calculate the band

structure and the angular momentum for a triangularlattice model, a square-lattice model, and a honeycomblattice model. We note that a similar calculation was already performed in Ref. [11]. The insets in Figs. 3(a1)-3(c-1) show the triangular-lattice, square-lattice and honeycomb-lattice models, respectively. In these models, one atom is located per each lattice site. Let the mass and the charge of all atoms be m and q, respectively. We show the phonon frequency and angular momentum under the magnetic field h in the direction perpendicular to the plane in Figs. 3(a-1) and 3(a-2) for the triangular-lattice model, Figs. 3(b-1) and 3(b-2) for the square-lattice model, and Figs. 3(c-1) and 3(c-2) for the honeycomb-lattice model. The values of the parameters used in the calculation in Fig. 3 are the following: the longitudinal spring constant KL = 0.144, the transverse one KT = KL/4, the lattice constant is a = 1, the charge and mass of all atoms are m = 1, q = -1, and the magnetic field h = 0.02. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the dispersion relation and the angular momentum of the phonon differ depending on the model, but the dispersion relation and the angular momentum of the acoustic phonon at the  point show the same behavior in all the models. In particular, the angular momentum of the acoustic phonon at the  point that appears after breaking the TRS has a peak with height in all the models.

Appendix D: Free charged particle in a magnetic field

In this appendix, we explain the cyclotron motion of a free charged particle in a uniform magnetic field. In particular, we calculate its kinetic and canonical angular momenta in order to see the correspondence to the phonon angular momentum at the  point discussed in the main text. The Hamiltonian of a free charged particle
in magnetic field B = (0, 0, B) is

H = 1 2, 2m q

where m and q are the mass and the charge of the par-

The insets in (a-1), (b-1), and (c-1) show schematic pictures of the models, and those in (a-2), (b-2), and (c-2) show their Brillouin zones.

C

=

eB mc

is

the

cyclotron

frequency.

We

then

introduce

(X, Y )  (x - , y - ) corresponding to the center of the

rotation.

Then, the commutation relations among , , X, and

Y are

[, ] = -il2, [X, Y ] = il2, [, X] = [, Y ] =[, X] = [, Y ] = 0.

(D5) (D6)

From these relations we define two bosonic annihilation operators

a^ = -1 ( + i), 2l
^b = 1 (X + iY ). 2l

(D7) (D8)

These two bosons commute: [a^, ^b] = [a^, ^b] = 0. Therefore, by using the vacuum state |0 , eigenstates can be

written as |A, B = (a^)A(^b)B |0 with nonnegative in-
tegers A and B.
Using these operators, we can define two number operators N^a and N^b, for the two species of bosons:

N^a

=

a^a^

=

1 2l2

2 + 2

1 -,
2

N^b

=

^b^b

=

1 2l2

X2 + Y 2

1 -.
2

(D9) (D10)

Then one can show

H=

C

N^a

+

1 2

,

X2 + Y 2 = 2l2

N^b

+

1 2

.

(D11) (D12)

Hence, the eigenstate |A, B has an energy E =

C

A

+

1 2

and is also an eigenstate of the operator

X2 + Y 2 with an eigenvalue 2l2

B

+

1 2

.

8

By using the number operators, the canonical angular momentum can be written as

Lz = x × p = N^a - N^b .

(D13)

Therefore, the eigenstate |A, B is an eigenstate of the canonical angular momentum with an eigenvalue
(A - B). On the other hand, the kinetic angular momentum is defined as

Lkzin = x × .

(D14)

Using the second quantized operators, we can express the kinetic angular momentum as

Lkzin = 2

N^a

+

1 2

+i

^ba^ - ^ba^ .

(D15)

Therefore, an expectation value of the kinetic angular

momentum of the eigenstate |A, B

is 2

(A

+

1 2

).

Thus, to summarize, the a^ boson has an energy C,

canonical angular momentum , and kinetic angular mo-

mentum 2 , while the ^b boson has zero energy, canonical

angular momentum 2 , and zero kinetic angular momen-

tum. From this result, we can interpret the behavior of

the angular momentum of the acoustic phonon at the 

point. By breaking the TRS, one of the acoustic phonons

acquires a nonzero frequency, while the other continues to

have zero frequency at the  point. Thus, these phonons

correspond to the a^ boson and the ^b boson, respectively.

Appendix E: Properties of the effective Hamiltonian (13)
In this appendix, we explain properties of the effective Hamiltonian of Eq. (13). First, we explain the properties of the spring constant matrix Kl,l and the definition of the dynamical matrix D(k). Next, using these, we show that an, bn, and cn in Eq. (14) are real. Furthermore, we explain how to calculate an, bn, and cn using the honeycomb-lattice model as an example.

1. Properties of D(k)

In this section, we explain the properties of the dynam-
ical matrix D(k), following Ref. [31]. When we expand the lattice potential U in terms of the vector ul around the equilibrium positions, which is the displacement multiplied by the square root of the mass of each atom in the unit lattice l and extracted up to the second term, it becomes

1 U U0 + 2

uTl Kl,l ul ,

l,l

(E1)

where the first-order term becomes zero, and the coefficient in the second-order term is defined as

2U

(Kl,l )b,b 

:=

ul,bul ,b 

.
u=0

(E2)

Here, ul,b is the mass-weighted displacement of the  component of atom b of the unit lattice l.
We explain the properties of (Kl,l )b,b . First, it naturally follows from the definition that

(Kl,l )b,b  = (Kl ,l)b ,b . Next, the periodicity of the lattice yields

(E3)

(Kl,l )b,b  = (K0,l -l)b,b  .

(E4)

Furthermore, the  component of the equation of motion of atom b in the unit cell l is given by

ml,bu¨l,b = -

(Kl,l )b,b  ul ,b  .

l ,b 

(E5)

Due to the translation symmetry, under uniform displacements of all the atoms, the force applied to atom b in unit cell l should be zero. Therefore, we obtain

(Kl,l )b,b  = 0.
l ,b

(E6)

By using Eq. (E6), we can rewrite the equation of motion,

ml,bu¨l,b =

(Kl,l )b,b  (ul,b - ul ,b ) .

l ,b (=l,b) 

(E7)

Therefore, the force applied by atom b of the unit cell l to atom b of unit cell l is

(Kl,l )b,b  (ul,b - ul ,b ) .


(E8)

Similarly, the force applied by the atom b of unit cell l to atom b of unit cell l is

(Kl ,l)b ,b (ul ,b  - ul,b) .


(E9)

Since these two forces are in an action-reaction relationship, (Kl,l )b,b  satisfies

(Kl,l )b,b  = (Kl ,l)b ,b .

(E10)

By using these properties of (Kl,l )b,b , the dynamical matrix D(k) is defined as

2. Expansion D(k)1/2 with respect to k = |k|

Here, we will show that an, bn, and cn in the top right block in Eq. (14) are real. First, this top right block of the matrix in Eq. (14) is written as

1D(k)1/2 1 1D(k)1/2 2 2D(k)1/2 1 2D(k)1/2 2

an cn cn bn

k

(E12)

by extracting the terms up to linear order in k. Here,

because D(k) is a positive-definite Hermitian matrix by definition, D(k)1/2 is also a positive-definite Hermitian matrix. Therefore, an and bn are real and positive. In the following, we show that cn is also real.
Since D(k) is analytic by definition, we expand the

dynamical matrix D(k) in terms of k:

D(k) D0 + Di(1)ki + Di(j2)kikj ,

i

i,j

(E13)

where D(k), D0, Di(1), and Di(j2) are 2n × 2n matrices.
Since D(k) is a Hermitian matrix and preserves TRS,
D(k) = D(k) = D(-k) holds. Therefore, D0 and Di(j2) are real symmetric matrices, and Di(1) are purely imaginary Hermitian matrices. Then, in order to take its square root, we rewrite Eq. (E13) as

D(k) D0 + Dn(1)k + Dn(2)k2,

(E14)

where k = kn. Then it follows that Dn(2) is a real symmetric matrix and Dn(1) is a purely imaginary Hermitian matrix.
We consider U D(k)U using the real orthogonal matrix
U that diagonalizes the real symmetric matrix D0,

U D(k)U

2 + U Dn(1)U k + U Dn(2)U k2, (E15)

where  is a diagonal matrix defined as

 1



 2



=  

...

,  

n

(E16)

with i (i = 1, 2, · · · , 2n) being phonon frequencies at
k = 0. It follows that 1 = 2 = 0 because they represent acoustic phonons.
Since the first two column vectors of U are eigenvectors 1, 2 of the acoustic phonons at the  point, the 2 × 2 block on the top left of the left side of Eq. (E15) is
D(k) (,  = 1, 2). Using Eqs. (E3), (E4), (E6), and (E10), we can calculate the component D(k)  (,  = 1, 2) as

D(k)  =

-4 b mb bb

(K0,l)b,b  sin2
l>0

k · Rl . 2 (E17)

Therefore, in the 2 × 2 block on the top left of the left
side of Eq. (E15), the zeroth- and first-order terms of k
vanish. Here, in Eq. (E15) the 2n × 2n matrices 2, U Dn(1)U ,
and U Dn(2)U are rewritten as

U D(k)U

2ac 2op

+

A1 C1 C1 B1

k+

A2 C2 C2 B2

k2,

(E18)

where ac = 0; A1 and A2 are 2 × 2 matrices; B1, B2, and 2op are (n - 2) × (n - 2) matrices; and C1 and C2 are 2×(n-2) matrices. Here ac and op are diagonal matrices with their diagonal elements given by frequencies of acoustic and optical branches at the  point, respectively. From Eq. (E17), we get A1 = 0. Due to the properties
of D(k) mentioned in Eq. (E13) together with reality of U , A2, B2, and C2 are real matrices and B1 and C1 are purely imaginary matrices.
Based on this discussion, we can expand U D(k)1/2U up to the first order with respect to k as follows:

U D(k)1/2U

O

XZ

op + Z Y k, (E19)

where O is a 2 × 2 zero matrix. We note that the top
left 2 × 2 block of this matrix, Xk, is equal to Eq. (E12).
Here we will show that X is a real matrix. By comparing
2
both sides of U D(k)1/2U = U D(k)U we obtain

C1 = Zop, A2 = X2 + ZZ,

(E20) (E21)

which yields

X=

A2 - C1-op2C1

1/2
.

(E22)

One can directly show that A2 - C1-op2C1 is a real symmetric matrix. In addition, X is a Hermitian matrix,
meaning that its eigenvalues are real. Therefore, the matrix A2 - C1-op2C1 = X2 is a positive-semidefinite matrix, and it can be diagonalized by a real orthogonal
matrix with nonnegative eigenvalues. Therefore, we con-
clude that X is a real symmetric matrix. By comparing
Eqs. (E12) and (E19) and noting that the first two col-
umn vectors of U are 1 and 2, the matrix Xk is equal to Eq. (E12), which leads to the conclusion that an, bn and cn are real.

3. Calculation of an, bn, and cn in the honeycomb-lattice model
We show how to calculate an, bn, and cn for the honeycomb-lattice model, as an example. With reference

10

to the Supplemental Material of Ref. [4], the dynamical matrix D(k) of the honeycomb-lattice model is

D(k) = + +

K1 + K2 + K3

where a1 = (a, 0) and a2 = (a/2, 3a/2) are primi-

tive vectors; K1, K2, and K3 are defined using Kx =

KL KT

as K1 = U (/2)KxU (-/2), K2 =

U (/6)KxU (-/6), K3 = U (-/6)KxU (/6); and

U () =

cos  - sin  sin  cos 

is a rotation matrix by an angle

 in two dimensions.

Next, we expand D(k) with respect to k as

D(k)

and

Kn(2)

(a2 ·n)2 2

K1

.

Since

K

is

a

diagonal

matrix,

the

orthogonal

matrix U that diagonalizes the first term in Eq. (E24),

i.e., the matrix D0 in Eq. (E13), is

U = 1 2

(E25)

where I is the 2×2 identity matrix. Therefore, we obtain

(E27)

where

(E29)

n

(E30)

where x = a1 · n and y = a2 · n. Here, the eigenvalues

Kn(1)

are

a KL2 +3KLKT 2

which

are

both

positive.

Therefore,

the

matrix

Kn(2)

is

a

matrix.

Hence, we can calculate an, bn, and cn using n, n, and n as



an cn cn bn

,

(E31)

where n = nn - n2 > 0. Therefore, an, bn, and cn are real.
