1 Introduction

We are interested in decay/contraction properties for the flow defined by a scalar conservation law

(1)

tu + divxf (u) = 0, x  Rd, t > 0.

The flux f : R  Rd is a smooth function. Restricting to the natural notion of entropy weak
solutions, Kruzkov's theory [8] tells us that the Cauchy problem is well-posed in the class L(Rd). We therefore denote (St)t0 the semi-group defined by the flow of (1). In one space dimension, the equation is written instead

(2)

tu + xf (u) = 0, x  R, t > 0.

When b - a  L1(Rd), we know that Stb - Sta  L1(Rd) as well, and t  Stb - Sta 1 is a non-increasing function. This contraction property does not extend to other Lp-norms, for p > 1. We only have that if a  Lp(Rd), then t  Sta p is non-increasing, as a consequence of the fact that s  |s|p is a convex function. More generally, for every convex function  : R  R,
the admissible solution u(t) = Sta satisfies a differential "entropy inequality"

t(u) + divxq(u)  0,

where q is the entropy flux, defined by q (s) := (s)f (s). If (0) = (0) = 0, this implies the monotonicity of

t  (u(t, x)) dx,

Rd

whenever   a is integrable.

There are several reasons why we do not content ourselves with L1-type results when study-

ing conservation laws. One of them is that the ultimate goal of the theory is to consider systems

of equations, such as the Euler system for inviscid compressible fluids, in several space dimen-

sions. Then it is known (J. Rauch [16]) that functional spaces such as L1(Rd) and its avatar

BV (Rd) are not appropriate: the Cauchy problem for linearized first-order hyperbolic systems

is not well-posed in Lp(Rd) for p = 2 (P. Brenner [3]). This is why the most general existence

and stability theorems have been established in classes build upon L2(Rd), typically Sobolev

spaces. For instance, it is known that the Cauchy problem for systems of conservation laws,

endowed with a strongly convex entropy, is locally (in time) well-posed in Hs(Rd) whenever

s

d 2

,

see

[5,

2].

Notice that such solutions are continuously differentiable in space and

time, thus exclude shock waves ; usually, they exist only for a finite time. Local existence and

stability of shock waves, hence of discontinuous solutions, are proved by A. Majda in a space

of piecewise Hs(Rd)-functions, where the regularity parameter s is even larger, see [13, 14].

It is thus desirable to establish L2-type results when discontinuous solutions are allowed.

An early, notable step in this direction was done by C. Dafermos [4] and R. J. DiPerna [6],

who introduced the notion of relative entropy to prove weak-strong uniqueness and stability

theorems. Roughly speaking, if a hyperbolic system of conservation laws is endowed with a

strongly convex entropy , and if the Cauchy problem admits a Lipschitz local-in-time solution,

then the weak entropy solution is unique, equal to that one. The L2-flavour of such a result is

reminiscent to the fact that the relative entropy

(u|v) := (u) - (v) - d(v) · (u - v)

can be recast as a quadratic form (u - v)T A(u, v)(u - v) where the symmetric matrix A, which depends continuously upon u and v, is positive definite. We notice that the uniqueness result is not associated with a contraction property, but follows from a Gronwall inequality. In particular, the time variable is present through an exponential factor.
When the reference solution v is merely piecewise Lipschitz continuous, the relative entropy approach fails, because even a small disturbance in the initial data induces a change of the shock velocity and results in a rather large L2-error. When d = 1, this happens already when

2

v(t, x) := (x - t) is a pure shock of (2), defined by

(3)

(y) =

u- if y < 0, u+ if y > 0.

This situation motivated N. Leger and A. Vasseur [10, 11] to enrich the approach by relative
entropy, allowing the reference solution to be translated in space by a time-dependent shift. For instance Leger proved that if the flux f is convex, then for every initial disturbance a -   L2(R), the L2-distance of u(t) = Sta to the set P of all translations of ,

d2(u(t);

P)

u(t) - (· - h)

2,

is a non-increasing function of time.

The assumption that the flux be convex cannot be removed in Leger's theorem. When

we turn towards multi-dimensional scalar conservation laws, this is a weakness, as we face

directional fluxes  · f , for every unit vector , which govern the propagation of planar waves

u(t, x) = U(t,  · x). Unless the conservation law is essentially one-dimensional ­ that is f (s) =

f0(s)V for a fixed vector V ­, there exist directions in which the flux is neither convex nor concave. Therefore there is no hope to extend Leger's result to the multi-D context. If we wish

instead to drop the restriction that the flux be convex, we must pay a price, by changing P

into a larger target set. A key remark is that P, from a geometrical perspective, is not so nice:

the curve h  h := (· - h) is not differentiable. Instead, it is of H¨older class with exponent

1 2

:

k - h 2 = |u+ - u-| · |h - k|1/2.

This suggests to replace P by a smoother target set. Of course, we wish to keep its nice
properties, namely the translation invariance ­ because the semi-group itself is translation
invariant, ­ and its invariance under the flow. Our choice will be to replace P by its closed convex hull, which we describe below. It seems to us that L2-stability properties of closed target set Q  L(Rd) is related to the following properties

· convexity,
· translation invariance : if a  Q and h  Rd, then ah := a(· - h)  Q,
· flow invariance : if a  Q and t > 0, then Sta  Q.
Our main result below is that if a   + L2(R), where  is as in (3), then the L2-distance d2(Sta; conv(P)) is a non-increasing function of time. We emphasize that we do not assume the convexity of the flux function f . Remarkably enough, we do not even need that the pure discontinuity  be an admissible shock. Instead, remarking that the closed convex hull M := conv(P) coincides with the set of functions a   + L2(R) that are monotonous from u- to u+, our result completes the well-known fact that St preserves the monotonicity.
Theorem 1.1 (d = 1.) Let u-, u+  R be given. Let M be the set of monotonous functions b over R, such that b - u±  L2(R±) (in particular b(±) = u±).
If a-u±  (L1L)(R±), then the L2-distance t  d2(Sta; M) is a non-increasing function.

3

Of course, if the end states u± coincide, then conv(P) is the singleton {a  u+} and the result is nothing but the well-known decay of t  u(t) - u+ 2. Likewise, the theorem implies the invariance of M under the flow, a property which follows immediately from the comparison
principle.

Our second example is multi-dimensional. Given r > 0, our target set Qr is the intersection of L(Rd) with the L1-ball of radius r. This too satisfies the three properties listed above. We notice that Qr  L2(Rd).
Theorem 1.2 (d  1.) Let Qr be the L1-ball of radius r > 0 in L(Rd). If a  (L2  L)(Rd), then t  d2(Sta; Qr) is non-increasing.
Both results are rather non-trivial. Even the projections upon either M or Qr are not ; we describe them in detail in the next sections. That these theorems hold true reveals that we do not yet understand completely the nature of the semi-group (St)t0 for an arbitrary scalar conservation law.

As a remark, let us mention a few other situations that are more or less trivial:

· For r > 0, the intersection Br of L(Rd) with the L2-ball of radius r satisfies the three properties listed above. Yet the distance d2(a; Br) equals ( a 2 - r)+, thus the decay of t  d2(u(t); Br) is an obvious consequence of that of u(t) 2.
· Let I = [u-, u+] be a closed interval. The set KI  L(Rd) of functions which take values in I satisfies the three properties listed above. The L2-projection of u over KI is nothing but I  u, where I : R  I is the usual projection. Thus

d2(a; KI ) =

1 2
(dist(a(x); I))2 dx .
R

Since  := (dist(·; I))2 is a convex function, the integral in the right-hand is non-increasing in time when applied to u(t) = Sta, as a result of an entropy inequality.
Notice that if the flux displays enough non-linearity, and if a  u¯ + L2(Rd) for some u¯  (u-, u+), we expect that Sta enters in KI after some finite time. In the case of the so-called multi-D Burgers equation, this property follows from the algebraic decay of
Sta - u¯ , proven by L. Silvestre and the author [19].
· The replacement of the L2-distance by the L1-distance is just old stuff. If Q is positively invariant, then the L1-distance of Sta to Q is non-increasing in time, because St is L1contracting.

Outline of the paper. Section 2 is two-fold. On the one hand, it describes the effect of the projection over monotone functions. On the other hand, it displays the calculation behind Theorem 1.1 when the projection of the solution u(t) behaves in a regular way in terms of the time variable. Section 3 is the technical part of the proof of Theorem 1.1, where we succeed to reduce the analysis to the regular situation studied before. Surprisingly enough, a key argument pertains to Real Algebraic Geometry. The proof of Theorem 1.2 is presented in Section 4. Because the projection over an L1-ball is somehow a simpler operation, we can use the full strength of the kinetic formulation.

2 Main results towards Theorem 1.1
Without loss of generality, we shall suppose u- < u+. The denote  the pure discontinuity defined by (3), even if it is not an admissible shock wave.
Recall that given a function  : R  R, its lower convex envelop is the maximal convex function   . It is also the upper bound of the family of affine functions   . If there does not exist such functions , then we have   -.
2.1 Projection over M
Let us denote  the L2-projection over M, the set of functions a   + L2(R) that are monotonous.
Proposition 2.1 Let w  ( + L2(R))  L(R) be given. Then w =  where  is the lower convex envelop of a primitive  of w.

Proof By construction,  belongs to M. Since this set is convex, and the projection is taken with
respect to a Hilbertian norm, it suffices to prove that for every g  M, one has

(4)

(w - )( - g) dx  0.

R

The open set A = {x; (x) < (x)} is a union of disjoint intervals (xj, yj). Mind that we do not exclude the possibility of a semi-infinite interval. Away from A, one has  =  = w. Thus
the left-hand side of (4) equals

(w - )( - g) dx =

A

yj
( - )( - g) dx.

In a given integral of the right-hand side above,  is a constant cj, the slope of the bi-tangent to the graph of  between xj and yj. Defining h = g - cj and  =  - , we see that   0 in (xj, yj) is such that (yj) = (xj) = 0, and h is non-decreasing. Integrating by parts, we have

yj

yj

(x)h(x) dx = - (x)h(x) dx  0.

xj

Hence each term of the sum is  0. This proves (4) and the statement.

left and right limits of w at x¯ satisfy w  wr.

2.2 The regular case: heuristic calculation
We now consider an admissible solution of (2), with u(t)   + L2(R). At each time, the primitive of the projection u(t) described in the previous paragraph differs from that of u(t) over an open subset. We speak of the regular case when this open set depends smoothly upon t on some time interval (t1, t2). In particular, the limit points xj(t) and yj(t) are well-defined continuous and piecewise differentiable functions. In this situation, we prove a slightly more general result than just the decay of the L2-distance to M :

Proposition 2.2 Let a  M  BV (R) be an initial data and u(t) := Sta. Suppose that the projection onto M is regular for t  (t1, t2). Then, for every C2-convex function , the
expression

is non-increasing in time.

(t) = (u(t)|u(t))(x) dx,
R

Proof

Denote (xj(t), yj(t)) the disjoint intervals where the primitives of u(t) and u(t) differ from

each other. Then

yj

(t) =

(u(t, x)|cj(t)) dx,

j xj

where u(t)  cj(t) over (xj(t), yj(t)).

6

We recall that T V (u(t, ·))  T V (a) and thus left and right traces u(t, x ± 0) are well-
defined. At every point xj, we denote vj,/r the left and right values u(t, xj ± 0). Likewise wj,/r := u(t, yj ± 0). If there is no ambiguity about the point, then we write instead u/r. By the remark in the previous paragraph, we always have u  ur.
Let us differentiate  :

where qj is the entropy flux associated with the convex entropy (·|cj). We notice that the factor of cj cancels1 because in the projection we have

Let us look at the factor Ajx j + Bj. There are two cases, whether u is continuous at xj or

not. If it is not, then u < cj < ur = vj,r, but then u(t) displays a shock along x = xj, so that

Rankine­Hugoniot gives

[f ] [u]

.

Because the shock is increasing, we also have the entropy criterion that the graph of f lies

ur
((s) - (cj)) ds = x j(ur|cj),
cj

because the slope of the chord is precisely the ratio [f ]/[u]. We deduce that Ajx j + Bj  0 in this case.
There remains the continuous case, where u = ur = cj. Here Aj and Bj vanish separately, so that again Ajx j + Bj = 0.
The calculation is similar for the contribution Cjyj + Dj. We conclude that   0. In other words t - (t) is non-increasing.

3 Proof of Theorem 1.1
We wish to apply Proposition 2.2 with the convex entropy (s) = s2. Because the solution u(t) depends also of the initial data a   + L2(R) and upon the flux f , we denote
f (t; a) = [(u(t) - u(t))(x)]2dx = (d2(u(t); M))2.
R
Following the notation of Paragraph 2.1, we denote A(t) the open set on which the primitive of u(t, ·) differs from its lower convex envelop.
It is unclear whether the exact calculation of Paragraph 2.2 can be applied directly to an entropy solution of (2). It might happen that the structure of A(t) varies so much that the calculation is not justified on any time interval. The combinatorial structure of the set of intervals could change drastically, infinitely many times.
We shall proceed as follows. By means of continuity arguments, prove that it suffices to consider BV data and polynomial fluxes f ; see Summary 3.1. An other continuity argument allows us to limit ourselves to approximate solutions that are exact solutions between times steps, at which they are L2-projected over piecewise constant functions ; see Claim 3.1. Such approximations can be obtained by the Godunov or Lax­Friedrichs schemes. We thus turn towards the case where the data, at some time step, is piecewise constant ; the corresponding solution concatenates Riemann problems, each one obeying an explicit formula involving an envelop. In particular A(t) is always the union of finitely many disjoint intervals. Because the
8

flux is now a polynomial function, the solution of each Riemann problem can be expressed in terms of some semialgebraic set. Taking the convex envelop, as mentionned in Proposition 2.1, preserves this property. Then the Tarski­Seidenberg theorem ensures that the times at which a recombination occurs in the structure of A(t), are finitely many. This allows us to apply piecewisely the calculation of Paragraph 2.2.

3.1 First reductions

Dependence upon a. Suppose that two data a1, a2  +L2(R) take values in some bounded interval [-M, M], and are such that a2 - a1  L1(R). The corresponding solutions satisfy

uj(t)   M,

u2(t) - u1(t) 1  a2 - a1 1,

which imply together

u2(t) - u1(t)

2 2



2M

a2 - a1

1.

Since the distance to M is a 1-Lipschitz function, we infer

|d2(u2(t); M) - d2(u1(t); M)|  2M a2 - a1 1 .
The functional a  f (t; a) is thus L1-continuous over the set of data a   + L2(R) with a prescribed pointwise bound M.
Since the pointwise limit of non-increasing functions is non-increasing, it is enough to prove Theorem 1.1 for an L1-dense subset of data. We shall therefore restrict our analysis to data a  BV (R) which coincide with  away from a bounded interval.

Time continuity. When a  BV (R)  ( + L2(R)), we know that

where M = hence

u(t + h) - u(t) 1  h Lip f |[-M,M] T V (a), 
a . Again, this gives u(t + h) - u(t) 2  C h for some finite constant C,

Lemma 3.1 If a  BV (R)  ( + L2(R)), then t  d2(u(t); M) is (H¨older) continuous.

Dependence upon the flux. We recall Lemma 11.1.1 of [18] : Let u be the entropy solution of (2) with data a  BV (R), and let v be the entropy solutions of another equation tv + xg(v) = 0, corresponding to the same initial data, then we have
T
v(T ) - u(T ) 1  T V ((g - f )  v(t)) dt.
0
Combined with T V (F  v)  Lip F |[-M,M] T V (a), where M = a , this yields the Lip-L1 continuity of the map f  u(t). With the same trick as above, we conclude that f  f (t; a) is continuous over Lip(-M, M), whenever a  BV (R)  ( + L2(R)) with a   M.
Thanks to this continuity property, we may restrict our study to fluxes that belong to a dense subspace of C1([-M, M]). Applying the Stone­Weierstrass theorem (to f  instead of f ), we may restrict to polynomial fluxes.

9

Summary 3.1 We only need to prove Theorem 1.1 when a  BV (R) is such that a -  is compactly supported, and the flux f is a polynomial function.

Approximate solutions. Our next remark is that the entropy solution of (2) is the strong limit of the sequence of approximate solutions uh (with h = x  0+ being the mesh size),
generated by monotone difference schemes. Herebelow, we consider either the Godunov or the Lax­Friedrichs schemes, with a fixed CFL ratio

(5)

.

The convergence follows from Kuznetsov's estimate [9] : 
uh(t) - u(t) 1  C ht T V (a).

Once again, we infer the L2-convergence, whence

d2(u(t);

M)

M),

so that

Claim 3.1 To prove Theorem 1.1, it suffices to verify that for every h > 0, the function

t  d2(uh(t); M)

is non-increasing.

Recall that the numerical scheme consists in alternating two operations. At each time step tk = kt, uh(tk-, ·) is interpolated by a piecewise constant function uh(tk+, ·). This interpolation is nothing but the L2-projection over the affine space of mesh-wise constant functions that tend to u± as x  ±. When k = 0, uh(0-) is simply the data a. Within an elementary time interval (tk, tk+1), uh is the (exact !) entropy solution originating from the data uh(tk+). It is obtained by concatenating solutions of Riemann Problems.
The interpolation step is the easy part of the analysis, as it does not involve the PDE at all:
Lemma 3.2 Let a   + L2(R) be given, and a¯ be its L2-projection over the affine subspace of mesh-wise constant functions. Then

The projection, given by

w(x) dx,
Ij

preserves the monotonicity: if w  M, then w¯  M. Because this is an orthogonal projection,

it is also a contraction. This implies

w  M, d2(u¯; M)  u¯ - w¯ 2  u - w 2. Minimizing over w  M, we obtain (6).

3.2 Facts about Riemann problems
The Riemann problem is the Cauchy problem for (2) when the initial data is of the form

u(0, x) =

v-, if x < 0, v+, if x > 0,

where v± are two constants. The solution is self-similar, denoted

u(t, x) = R

x t

;

v-,

v+

.

Because the initial data is monotonous, the solution is monotonous in the space variable as well. We may apply Matthias Kunic's formula [7] (see also [17], Proposition 2.5.1), which is dual to that of Lax ; it drops the assumption of a convex flux and asks instead for a monotonous data. We shall be concerned only by the non-decreasing case v- < v+, where the primitive p(t, ·) of u(t, ·) is given by

p(t,

x)

=

sup
s

inf {s(x y

-

y)

-

tf (s)

+

p0(y)}.

The primitive of u(0, ·) being p0(y) = v±y when ±y > 0, up to an additive constant, Kunik's

formula yields

p(t, x) = tP

x t

,

P () := sup {s - f (s)}.
v-sv+

Notice that the Legendre transform P  is the lower convex envelop of the restriction f |[v-,v+].

3.3 End of the proof
Because of Claim 3.1 and Lemma 3.2, there remains to prove that t  d2(uh(t); M) is nonincreasing in each of the time intervals (tk + 0, tk+1 - 0). Translating in time, this amounts to prove Theorem 1.1 over (0, t) whenever the initial data a  BV (R)  ( + L2(R)) is mesh-wise constant. Summary 3.1 tells us that we may also assume on the one hand that only finitely many values
aj := a|Ij
11

differ from u±, and on the other hand the flux f is a polynomial. We point out that the former constraint remains valid as time increases, the number of meshes where a =  increasing only by 2 at each time step. The main result of this paragraph is
Lemma 3.3 Denote z the corresponding solution of the Cauchy problem associated with a mesh-wise constant initial data a¯ = (aj)jZ. Assume
· the flux f is a polynomial,
· aj  u- for j << -1, while aj  u+ for j >> 1,
· the CFL condition (5).
Then the interval (0, t) splits into finitely many sub-intervals, in each of which the projection of z(t) over M is regular, in the sense of Paragraph 2.2.
Proposition 2.2, applied with (s) = s2, tells us that d2(u(t); M) is non-increasing within each of the sub-intervals mentionned in Lemma 3.3. Combining with the continuity stated in Lemma 3.1, we infer that it is non-increasing on the whole interval (0, t). This ends the proof of Theorem 1.1, provided we prove Lemma 3.3, which we do now.

p(t, ·) on bi-tangents, whose extremities belong to meshes where p(t) is convex. Given two such

meshes, there is at most one bi-tangent between them. In addition p(t) needs to be concave

somewhere in between, and thus the meshes may not be contiguous. Notice that a segment

can be semi-infinite, meaning that it is tangent to the graph of p(t) at a finite point and at

12

±. Since z(t)   away from a compact interval, q(t, ·) differs from p(t, ·) on finitely many

segments only.

Define J  Z the finite set of indices such that aj < aj+1. To determine the bi-tangents, we

the

envelop

of

the

restriction

the

flux

to

(aj, aj+1). It is therefore a C1-function on this interval, whose derivatives are derivatives of

f . The existence of a bi-tangent necessitates that (ai, ai+1)  (aj, aj+1) = . Because of the

CFL condition, the left-hand side of (7) is a uniformly increasing function of . Thanks to the

Implicit Function Theorem, the slope  = (t) of the bi-tangent is a C1 function of time.

Our solution z is thus regular on every time interval on which the bi-tangents depend

continuously upon t. A recombination of A(t) may occur only if two consecutive bi-tangents,

corresponding to pairs (i, j) and (j, k), happen to coincide. Thus we are lead to study the

occurences of tri-tangents to the graph of p(t).

For a tri-tangent to occur at some t  (0, t), one needs a triple i < j < k of elements of

J. Then the slope  satisfies

We may express the solutions of (8) (respectively of (9)) by  = ij(t) (resp.  = jk(t)) where the functions ·· are C1. Thus A(t) may recombine only at times such that ij(t) = jk(t).

For a general flux, the solution set of this equation can be extremely complicated. But after

our reductions, we need only to consider the case of a polynomial flux.

its

By the Tarski­Seidenberg Principle, the projection ST ijk of SAijk on the time axis is still a semialgebraic set, see [1] Chapter 5. It is therefore a finite union of points and intervals3. This

projection is precisely the set of times t  (0, t) at which a tri-tangent occurs, with tangencies

in the meshes of indices i, j, k. If it occurs an isolated point, fine ! If instead it occurs along

a time interval (t-, t+), then consider this tri-tangent as a each of the segments of ST ijk

we may ignore the regular bi-tangent by its extremities,

view of the regularity of z, to a finite set ST ijk.

Since the admissible triples (i, j, k) are finitely many (because J is finite), the union ST

of the sets ST ijk is still finite. It splits (0, t) into finitely many sub-intervals, on which our solution is regular in the sense of Paragraph 2.2.

This ends the proof of Theorem 1.1.

4 Proof of Theorem 1.2
The situation is now multi-dimensional. We consider data in (L2 L)(Rd), a domain invariant under the action of the semi-group. The target set is the ball Qr defined by

a 1 := |a(x)| dx  r.
Rd

4.1 Projection over Qr
If r > 0, the intersection Dr of the closed ball B(0; r) in L1(Rd), with L2(Rd) is a closed convex subset of the latter. Let r : L2(Rd)  Dr be the projection according to the natural distance d(v, w) = w - v 2. The L2-projection from L2  L onto Qr is nothing but the restriction of r.

Proposition 4.1 If v  L2(Rd), then either rv = v (if v 1  r), or rv = (sgn v)(|v| - s)+ where s  0 is determined by
(|v| - s)+dx = r,
Rd
if instead v 1 > r.

Proof We may assume the latter situation. If s > 0, then

(|v| - s)+dx 
Rd

{|v|>s}

|v(x)| dx

v(x)2dx < .
Rd

3These assertions tell us that semialgebraic sets form an o-minimal structure.

14

The map I : s  (|v| - s)+dx is non-increasing, ranging from I(0+) = v 1 (possibly infinite)

to I( v ) = 0. It is actually Lipschitz continuous away from the origin, because is 0 < s < t,

then

I(s) - I(t)  (t - s)meas{|v| > t} 

v t2

(t

s).

At last, I is strictly monotonous over (0, v ) because if 0 < s < t < |v|, then (|v| - t)+ - (|v| - s)+ = s - t < 0. There exists therefore a unique s  (0, v ) such that I(s) = r.
Proving that g := (sgn v)(|v| - s)+ is the projection amounts to verifying v - g, g - h  0

for every h  Dr. But this quantity equals

4.2 Proof by the kinetic formulation
We have the slightly more general result:
Theorem 4.1 Let a  L2(Rd) be an initial data and u(t) := Sta. Let  be a smooth even convex function with (0) = 0. Denote v(t) = ru(t). Then the expression

(t) := (u(t, x) - v(t, x)) dx
Rd
is a non-increasing function of time.

We emphasize the fact that the statement is valid only if  is even (see the proof below), and that it does not involve a relative entropy. We notice also that, because t  u(t) 1 is non-increasing, the projection r acts non-trivially for t in some time interval (0, T ) (with T possibly infinite or null), and then trivially for t  T , in which case (t) = 0.

Proof

We use the kinetic formulation of (1). To this end, we recall the definition of the chi-function:

  1 if 0 <  < u,

(; u)

=



-1 0

if

u <  < 0, otherwise.

The function u(t, x) is an entropy solution of (1) if and only if there exists a non-negative bounded measure m  C(R; M(R+×Rd)), such that the kinetic density h(t, x, ) := (; u(t, x)) satisfies the transport equation (see [12], or Theorem 3.2.1 of [15])
