Rheotaxis is a well-known behavior of micro-organisms such as E.Coli and sperm cells and artificial active colloids, wherein the swimmers move anisotropically in response to the imposed fluid flow. Here, we report, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, on the upstream Rheotaxis behavior of the self-propelled micrometer-sized 4-Cyano-4-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) droplets in an aqueous solution of tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) as the surfactant, in an optical cell under externally imposed flow. The behavior is absent in the density matched system indicating that presence of a nearby wall generating a flow-gradient at the droplet level is at the root of this behvaior. Our experiments with optical cells of different vertical heights further highlight that the behavior is observed for a given range of shear rate only and does not depend on the bulk flow-rate. We hypothesize, that the imposed shear flow disturbs the otherwise isotropic distribution of the solutes (filled/empty micelles) allowing the droplets to go against the flow. We also observe that the nematic nature of the droplets also affects the motion during the rheotactic flight. By taking the advantage of this phenomenon, we demonstrate a unique capability of the droplet to be hydrodynamically trapped locally in an external shear flow, which can be useful towards new applications.
I. Introduction
Microorganisms such as bacteria use their internal molecular motors to drive appendages attached to their surface, which results in their directed movement. In order to understand this unique and intriguing motion, recently, scientists have synthesized artificial micro-swimmers.1,2 These synthetic swimmers also harvest energy from their surroundings to perform similar mechanical motion. However, unlike micro-organisms, their movement does not involve moving parts, instead, they exploit a local gradient generated by their nonuniform interactions with the surroundings. Janus colloids use their in-built asymmetric chemical patterning on the two halves, to propel themselves through self-diffusophoresis3 i.e. generation of slip at the solid boundary due to a self-generated gradient in solute concentration. Active droplets on the other hand, which are isotropic droplets of one fluid dispersed in another immiscible fluid, generate spontaneous asymmetry in the surfactant concentration (sc) along the interface through different mechanisms. sc creates a gradient in the interfacial tension (), which drives the fluid from low  toward high , resulting in
1

Marangoni interfacial stresses.2,4 Since, there is no net external force acting on the system, to conserve the overall linear momentum, this interfacial flow propels the droplet toward the region of low interfacial tension. A common strategy is to utilize the adsorption-depletion of surfactants triggered by micellar solubilization.2,5­9
Since, the fundamental principal of motion in artificial self-propelled systems is same as the microorganisms i.e. to break the symmetry, they successfully mimic several aspects in their transport (isolated and collective) behavior with various micro-organisms.10 For example, artificial active matter systems have been shown to demonstrate short-time directed and long-time random behavior,11 which is analogous to the run and tumble motion of bacteria and algae. Another parallel is their capability to sense and respond to the gradient present in their surroundings, a behavior known as "taxis". Chemotaxis corresponds to the response due to the gradient in the concentration of an external chemical stimulus. Bacteria are well known to demonstrate Chemotaxis in guiding them towards nutrient rich surroundings and flee them away from poisons.12 Similar behavior has been observed in sperm cells also.13 The mechanism is also critical to cell migration which plays critical role in several physiological and pathological processes such as migration of neurons or lymphocytes. Using 5CB LC in TTAB aqueous solution as the model system, Jin et al.14 reported a similar chemotaxis behavior of the active droplets, where the droplets moved preferentially towards the higher surfactant concentration regions and away from the surfactant lean regions. In addition, unlike Brownian motion, artificial active motors demonstrate directed motion for sustained time intervals. Due to this enhanced control over the individual colloidal motion, in last few decades, these systems have attracted a huge interest, for their potential as cargo carriers in microscopic domains,15,16 and tuning material properties.17 In microscopic domains, living organisms demonstrate variety of non-equilibrium phenomenon which originates from their interactions (hydrodynamic and chemical) with surrounding fluid elements and nearby interfaces. In particular, an external fluid flow environment near a no-slip impenetrable boundary exposes the micro-organisms to a velocity gradient. Under these circumstances Bacteria and sperm cells are well known to demonstrate upstream Rheotaxis because of their chirality induced hydrodynamic reorientation coupled with their active motility.18,19 Asymmetric active JPs have also been shown to demonstrate the rheotaxis behavior due to the interplay of polarity of the particle and shear torque.20­22 However, for symmetric spherical active JPs external flow induced a preferential cross-stream migration.23,24 To the best of our knowledge, the response of spherical active droplets in externally imposed flow has not been explored yet. Hence, in this study we use 4-Cyano- 4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB), a thermotropic liquid crystal, in aqueous solution of ionic tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) surfactant as the system to explore this motion. Among, different combinations of oil droplets in aqueous ionic surfactant solutions2,4,25­32 and inverse oil in water emulsions5 which have been reported to display self-propelled motion through this mechanism, employing a nematic liquid crystal (LC) phase as the active

oil droplet is known to aid in visualization of the flow-field inside the droplets and hence has been used in our study as well.

II. Experimental Section
To produce stable droplets of 5CB of size ~80 µm, a micro-injector (Femtojet 4i, Eppendorf) was used to inject appropriate amount of nematic liquid crystal 5CB into a petri-dish which was prefilled with 6wt% aqueous solution of TTAB surfactant. The dilute emulsion of the 5CB droplets was then injected into a custom-made optical cell ((W) 10mm x (H) 3.2mm x (L) 70mm), prepared using glass slides which were thoroughly cleaned using the standard pirhana solution. The cell was connected via tubing with a 10ml glass syringe prefilled with 6wt% TTAB aqueous surfactant solution. The syringe was mounted on a syringe pump (Chemyx 2000) using which the droplets in the cell were subjected to different volumetric flow rates (5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30 ml hr-1) along the length of the cell in the -X direction, as shown in the schematic figure 1. Since the 5CB droplets are denser (5CB~ 1.05 gm l-1 and water~ 1.0 gm l-1) than water, they readily

sediment to the bottom wall of the cell. In absence of external flow, the droplets perform 2D motion while remaining confined to the X-Y plane parallel to the bottom wall. Exposure to shear flow occasionally lifts the droplet in the Z direction i.e. normal to the flow direction and out of plane. Although, the syringe pump generates a steady pressure driven parabolic flow i.e. Poiseuille flow in the optical cell, however, since the droplets are mostly near the bottom wall and are much smaller in size compared to the cell height, the local flow profile for the droplets can be assumed as simple shear flow with gradient in the Z direction. An upright polarized optical microscope Olympus BX53 was used to observe the active motion of the isolated droplets exposed to different volumetric flows. The motion of droplets was recorded at 20 fps using Olympus LC-30 camera with 1024 x 768 pixel2 resolution. To make the presence of side walls of channels irrelevant, droplets were focused within a narrow Y range (~500microns) along the centerline of the
3

channel. Also, since the width of the cell in Y direction is also much larger than the droplet size, flow can be considered uniform along the Y direction. Droplet tracking was performed with the Image-J software, using an image correlation-based approach, to obtain the particle trajectories in X-Y plane.
III. Results A. Active motion in quiescent media To validate our microscopy setup, we first conducted the experiment to explore the droplet motion in presence of 6wt% TTAB aqueous solution in absence of any imposed external flow. As expected, these droplets perform random active motion in the 2D X-Y plane close to the bottom wall without any significant

vertical (Z) drift. Figure 2 shows the 2-D mean squared displacement (MSD) of a representative active droplet trajectory (t ~250 s), the inset shows the corresponding raw X-Y trajectory. It can be seen that at short times the MSD scales as t2 i.e. ballistic motion, which transitions to t1 at long times which is indicative of the random behavior. This observation is consistent with previous reports where size dependent modes of active motion of the 5CB droplets were discussed. Suga et al.33 demonstrated that the smaller droplets (~19µm) demonstrate linear trajectory, moderate sized droplets (20µm -50µm) show the curling motion and the larger droplets (50µm -100µm) show random motion.

Figure 3: Trajectories (~42s) of passive 5CB droplets (~80µm) in external shear flow of 1wt% TTAB aqueous solution. To validate our flow-set up, we then analyzed the motion of a passive 5CB droplet in external flow. We suspended the 5CB droplet in 1 wt% TTAB surfactant solution, in which the droplet does not perform any active motion. This is consistent with the fact that the 5CB droplets initiate their self-propelled motion when the bulk surfactant concentration is significantly above (~3wt%) the CMC (~0.13wt%) to generate the required surfactant concentration gradient at the droplet interface. At low flow rates (5-30 ml hr-1), the droplet remained stationary, but at higher flow rates droplets migrated along the flow in -X direction, as shown in figure 3, with insignificant drift in the orthogonal directions.

D. Active motion in flow

Having benchmarked our experimental setup, we now proceed to investigate the effect of external flow on the dynamics of active 5CB droplets. At lower flow rates of 5 ml hr-1 to 20 ml hr-1, we were able to capture trajectories for ~70s. However, for higher flow rates of 30 ml hr-1 the droplets escaped the frame of view quicker, so the trajectories were captured for smaller duration ~50s. A simple observation of representative trajectories shown in figure 4 suggests that smaller flows of 5 ml hr-1 and 8 ml hr-1, have negligible effect
5

on the active motion of droplets, as they continue to do the active random motion without any noticeable directional bias.
At intermediate flow rates of 10 ml hr-1 - 20 ml hr-1, unexpectedly, droplets start to move against the flow i.e. +X direction (figure 4(c-f)). This upstream migration behavior is known as Rheotaxis and it is a well reported phenomena for micro-organisms18,19 and synthetic active colloidal particles.20,22­24 From the trajectories, another interesting observation is that while performing rheotaxis, the trajectories of the droplets are oscillatory in nature, with nearly fixed frequency and amplitude. Also, with increasing flow rate the displacement of the active droplet against the flow decreases monotonically. On increasing the flow rates even further, at 30 ml hr-1 droplets stop their upstream migration and get adjected downstream by the flow.

IV. Discussion

To quantify this experimental observation, using the X-Y data, we calculated vx , where

vx

=

Xt+t - Xt t

is the average X velocity of the droplets. Here,

represents the time and ensemble

(comprising of ~10-15 droplets) average. Figure 5 illustrates the variation in vx with respect to the flow
rate. The plot suggests that for lower flow rates, since the droplets perform random active motion, it results
in vx ~ 0 m s-1. At moderate flow rates, vx > 0 indicative of upstream rheotactic behavior of the

6

droplets, and for higher flow rates vx < 0 indicative of droplets drifting with the flow. For even higher
flow rates > 30 ml hr-1, the droplets continue to drift downstream by detaching from the bottom wall. That regime has not been discussed here.

Based on the understanding of the mechanism for the upstream migration of the mammalian sperm cells, or E .Coli and artificial active colloids, we suspect the nearby wall generating shear flow (gradient in Z direction) to play a major role in the rheotaxis behavior of the droplets as well. Therefore, first to isolate the effect of wall, we repeated the flow experiments with heavy water (D2O) added to the aqueous surfactant solution, so that the density of solution matches with the density of 5CB. In the density matched environment, active 5CB droplets no longer remain constrained to move along the 2D plane near the bottom wall, rather are free explore the Z direction as well. In these systems, in contrast to the previous case, on exposure to external flow, active 5CB droplets do not demonstrate the upstream rheotactic behavior. For low flowrates of 0.3ml hr-1 to 7ml hr -1 droplets performed 3-D active random motion without any directional bias and above 7ml hr -1 droplets migrated with the flow while performing 3-D active motion. Based on the theoretical fluid velocity profile, as we know, that near the bottom wall of the optical cell at the droplet length scale (80µm), which is much less than the channel height (3.2 mm), the droplet experiences a simple shear flow. This suggests that the presence of the nearby wall and the consequent flow-gradient induced
7

effects on droplets surroundings are essential to observe the phenomena. We also carried out the experiments in different optical cell with different vertical heights (h) which exposes the droplets to
different shear rate at same overall external flow. Figure 6 illustrates the variation in vx with the local
shear rate (~V*/R). Here V* is the local flow velocity at the droplet center height calculated using the theoretical prediction shown in in supporting figure 1S. Figure 6 suggests that within a certain moderate
range of shear rate only droplets perform upstream rheotaxis i.e. vx > 0. For low shear rates droplets
perform the active random motion i.e. vx ~0 and for higher range of shear rates droplets migrate along

the flow i.e. vx < 0. Results shown in figure 6, further confirms our previous speculation.

Next, using the schematic shown in figure 7, we propose our hypothesis behind this observation. The droplets are propelled due to the micellar solubilization mechanism, where the motion is mainly affected by the local concentration of free surfactant molecules and filled micelles. Under quiescent conditions, the local concentration (fresh surfactants and filled micelles) fluctuations do not have any preferred direction govern the active droplet motion direction. In external flow, an anisotropy (along X in this case) in the
8

supply of fresh surfactant molecules is generated. In addition, the bulk flow in X direction sweeps away the local filled micelles from the droplet surroundings. However, since the droplet is close to the bottom wall, the surrounding fluid flow profile is not symmetric in the vertical Z direction. Consequently, the downstream side of the droplet close to the bottom wall, due to the insignificant flow, will retain some filled micelles. Since micelles diffuse slowly the trail of filled micelles persists for a long time which promotes negative autochemotaxis steering the droplet in the direction where it can avoid filled micelles. The asymmetric sweeping away of filled micelles, generates an anisotropy across the droplet which pushes the droplet against the flow. Due to shear flow experienced by the droplet the supply of the fresh surfactants to the droplet interface will be different at different locations.

Now coming to the oscillatory nature of the trajectories during the rheotacic motion.

appears that the oscillatory nature of the trajectories is significantly affected by the imposed flow rate. At

10ml hr -1, when droplets just start to perform upstream rheotaxis, the oscillations are weak, but as the flow

rate is increased the wavelength of the oscillations decrease. At highest flow rate (30 ml hr-1) when the

droplets simple advects downstream, the oscillations are again significantly less. However, in the control

experiments, the inactive droplets did not demonstrate any oscillation in their downstream migration, which

suggests that the oscillating behavior of the active droplets originates due to their self-propelling nature.

In 2016, Jin et al.14 first reported a curling (2D)/helical (3D) behavior of active 5CB droplets in TTAB aqueous solution. Self-propelled movement of the droplet generates interfacial viscous forces which deflects the defect at the apex of the droplet from the direction of motion towards the equator. The deflection is opposed by the elastic forces of the nematic LC and an equilibrium deflection angle (s) between the nematic director (n) and the velocity field is attained. This deflection of the defect results in asymmetry of the interfacial flow due to Marangoni stresses and to conserve the overall angular momentum (on a torque free system) a rotational component to the motion is added which causes the droplet to rotate. We believe that the same underlying mechanism is responsible for the oscillatory behavior of the active droplets during their rheotactic flight. Under quiescent conditions, we earlier observed that droplets of size ~ 80 m do not demonstrate proper curling motion, which agrees with the established studies. The reason for the absence

of any curling behavior in stationery surrounding is that the viscous stress only originates because of the droplets' self-propelled velocity (vo), which may remain inadequate to invoke a good response from the weak elastic forces (~1/R2). However, in our flow experiments, where the droplets are migrating against the flow the viscous stresses at the droplet interface originates due to the relative velocity i.e. resultant vector sum (vrel.= vo + V*) of the self-propelled velocity vo (under quiescent conditions) of the droplet and the external shear flow velocity V*. And, since |vrel.| > |vo|, droplets as large as 80 m experiences significantly higher viscous stresses, generating enough deflection in the defect location that elastic forces become important. For a given droplet size and surfactant concentration, vrel. is expected to increase monotonically with increasing imposed flowrate. Since, at low shear flow vrel. is less, the deflection (s) is expected to be less resulting in lesser extent of curling. Whereas, at larger shear flow i.e. large vrel., s is large which results in enhanced curling.
To further verify this claim, we repeated the experiment to probe the rheotactic motion of a smaller ~45 m droplet. Figure 9 shows a representative trajectory of an active droplet, which clearly demonstrates significantly lesser oscillatory behavior on being exposed to similar shear flow (~12 ml hr-1). Here, despite similar vrel. for the droplet, due to its smaller size the stronger elastic forces (~1/R2) result in smaller s, and therefore lesser oscillations.

Towards the end, we exposed an active droplet to external flow rates of 12 ml hr-1 and 30 ml hr-1 in a periodic manner, as shown in figure 10. At 12 ml hr-1 droplet performs upstream rheotaxis (red trajectory) and subsequently on changing the external flow rate to 30 ml hr-1, it instantaneously started to drift with the flow (black trajectory). Again, when the flow rate is reduced to 12 ml hr-1 droplet resumed rheotaxis. Although, this time the trajectory follows a different path. At the next exposure of 30 ml hr-1, the droplet
starts drifting with the flow again by choosing a different path. This shows that if the imposed flowrate is carefully varied, these series of events (rheotaxis drift with the flow rheotaxis) will be followed one

after the other and the droplet will remain trapped between two X positions. To the best of our knowledge, this experiment for the first time successfully demonstrates a unique hydrodynamic trapping of an active droplet, which utilizes their unique response of performing upstream rheotaxis on exposure to shear flow. V. Conclusions In this paper, for the first time, to the best our knowledge, we demonstrate the upstream Rheotaxis behavior of active droplets on being exposed to external shear flow near a planar wall. The effect originates from the gradient in flow across droplet, generating an anisotropy, along the flow direction, in the concentration gradient of surfactant/filled micelles, which otherwise remains isotropic in the quiescent ambient conditions. Our results suggest that at low shear rates, this alteration by shear flow remains weak and droplets continue their random active motion. At very high flow rates, the flow washes out the filled micelles which impairs the required concentration gradient for active motion. So, the droplets just drift with the flow in the downstream direction. In the bulk also, the external uniform flow, does not generate any anisotropy and the droplets either perform random active motion or drift downstream. Its only under the moderate flow conditions near the wall, that the anisotropy in the concentration gradient is successfully established which results in Rheotaxis. Another key observation is that while performing rheotaxis the trajectories of active droplets are oscillatory in nature, which can be attributed to the nematic phase of the droplet, which earlier has been shown to cause curling motion. In the end, utilizing the rheotaxis behavior of the droplets, we demonstrated a unique hydrodynamic trapping of the active droplet, which can be used in newer applications. Deeper insights into this unique behavior in future, both through experiments and analytical studies, will facilitate enhanced capabilities of controlled drug delivery systems.
