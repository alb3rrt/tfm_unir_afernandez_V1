## Abstract

In this paper, we study the performance and generalizability of three approaches for AD detection from speech on the recent ADReSSo challenge dataset: 1) using conventional acoustic features 2) using novel pre-trained acoustic embeddings 3) combining acoustic features and embeddings. We find that while feature-based approaches have a higher precision, classification approaches relying on the combination of embeddings and features prove to have a higher, and more balanced performance across multiple metrics of performance. Our best model, using such a combined approach, outperforms the acoustic baseline in the challenge by 2.8\%.
