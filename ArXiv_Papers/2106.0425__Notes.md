## Abstract

Several recent inequalities bound the precision of a current - counting net number of transitions in a system - by a thermodynamic measure of dissipation. However, while currents may be defined locally, dissipation is a global property. Inspired by the fact that ever since Carnot cycles are the unit elements of thermodynamic processes, we prove similar bounds tailored to cycle currents - counting net cycle completions - in terms of their conjugate affinities. We show that these inequalities are stricter than previous ones, even far from equilibrium, and that they allow to tighten those on transition currents. We illustrate our results with a simple model and discuss some technical and conceptual issues related to shifting attention from transition to cycle observables.
