CHASING MAXIMAL PRO-p GALOIS GROUPS WITH 1-CYCLOTOMICITY
CLAUDIO QUADRELLI
Abstract. Let p be a prime. A cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-p group is a pair consisting of a pro-p group G together with a continuous G-module Zp() isomorphic to Zp as an abelian pro-p group, such that the natural map in cohomology H1(G, Zp()/pn)  H1(G, Zp()/p) is surjective for every n  1. One has a 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p group if cohomological Kummerianity holds for every closed subgroup. By Kummer theory, the maximal pro-p Galois group of a field containing a root of 1 of order p together with the cyclotomic character is 1-cyclotomic. We prove that cohomological Kummerianity is preserved by certain quotients of pro-p groups, and we extend the group-theoretic characterization of cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-p groups, established by I. Efrat and the author, to the non-finitely generated case. We employ these results to find interesting new examples of pro-p groups which do not occur as absolute Galois groups, which other methods fail to detect.
1. Introduction Throughout the paper p will denote a prime number. For a field K, let K¯ s and K(p) denote respectively the separable closure of K, and the compositum of all finite Galois p-extensions of K. The maximal pro-p Galois group of K, denoted by GK(p), is the maximal pro-p quotient of the absolute Galois group Gal(K¯ s/K) of K, and it coincides with the Galois group of the extension K(p)/K. Delineating absolute Galois groups among profinite groups, and maximal pro-p Galois groups among pro-p groups, are crucial problems in Galois theory (see, e.g., [14, § 3.12] and [20, § 2.2]). Already the pursue of concrete examples of pro-p groups which do not occur as maximal pro-p Galois groups -- and thus also as absolute Galois groups (see Remark 6.1) -- of fields is considered a very remarkable challenge (see, e.g., [2, 4, 21, 29]). For example, one of the oldest known obstructions for the realization of a pro-p group as the maximal pro-p Galois group for some field comes from the Artin-Schreier theorem (whose pro-p version is due to E. Becker, see [1]): the only non-trivial finite group which occurs as the absolute Galois group (and maximal pro-p Galois group) of a field is the cyclic group of order two. The proof of the celebrated Bloch-Kato conjecture by M. Rost and V. Voevodsky, with the contribution by Ch. Weibel (see [15, 35, 39, 41]) provided a description of the Galois cohomology of absolute Galois groups of fields in terms of low degree cohomology.

CLAUDIO QUADRELLI

This spectacular achievement lead to a series of new results on the structure of maximal pro-p Galois groups of fields and their cohomology (see, e.g., [4, 12, 19, 24, 27]).
A possible way to takle the problem of delineating maximal pro-p Galois groups among pro-p groups is to study oriented pro-p groups: an oriented pro-p group is a pair G = (G, ) consisting of a pro-p group G together with a homomorphism of pro-p groups  : G  1 + pZp (see [31]) -- here 1 + pZp denotes the multiplicative abelian pro-p group {1 + p |   Zp}. Given a field K containing a primitive p-th root of unity of 1, the cyclotomic character

(1.1)

K,p : GK(p) - 1 + pZp,

s.t. g. = K,p(g)  g  GK(p),

for all   K(p) such that pn = 1 for some n  1, completes naturally GK(p) into an

oriented pro-p group GK,p = (GK(p), K,p). The oriented pro-p group GK,p satisfies the following formal version of Hilbert 90. Given an oriented pro-p group G = (G, ), let

Zp() denote the continuous G-module which is isomorphic to Zp as an abelian pro-p group, and endowed with the left G-action given by g.v = (g)·v for all g  G, v  Zp().

The oriented pro-p group G is said to be cohomologically Kummerian if the morphism

(1.2)

H1(G, Zp()/pnZp()) - H1(G, Zp()/pZp()),

induced by the epimorphism of G-modules Zp()/pnZp()  Zp()/pZp(), is surjective for every n  1; and moreover G is said to be 1-cyclotomic if the oriented pro-p group GH = (H, |H ) is cohomologically Kummerian for every closed subgroup H  G. By Kummer theory, the oriented pro-p group GK,p is 1-cyclotomic (see § 2.2 below).
This property was used first by J. Labute to study Demushkin groups: he proved ante litteram that the only homomorphism  : G  1 + pZp which completes a Demushkin group G into a cohomological Kummerian oriented pro-p group is the one induced by the dualizing module of G (see [16, Thm. 4]). More recently, cohomologically Kummerian and 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p groups were formally introduced and investigated (see [3, 13, 30, 31, 38]) to study maximal pro-p Galois groups: these works suggest that 1-cyclotomicity is a very restrictive property, and therefore pro-p groups which may be completed into 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p groups "approximate" quite well maximal pro-p Galois groups. This provides a very strong motivation for studying cohomologically Kummerian and 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p groups.
In this paper we focus on some properties of cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-p groups, which may be used to detect pro-p groups that cannot complete into 1cyclotomic oriented pro-p groups -- and thus, which do not occur as absolute Galois groups. The first result we pursue is that cohomological Kummerianity gets inherited by "nice" quotients.

Theorem 1.1. Let G be a cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-p group, and suppose that Im()  1 + 4Z2 if p = 2. Let N be a closed normal subgroup of G such that:
(i) N acts trivially on Zp(), i.e., N  Ker(); (ii) G/N is finitely generated; (iii) the restriction map res1G,N : H1(G, Z/p)  H1(N, Z/p) is injective. Then also the cyclotomic pro-p pair G¯ = (G/N, ¯), where the morphism ¯: G/N  1 + pZp is induced by , is cohomologically Kummerian.

Observe that the cohomological condition (iii) amounts to requiring that G has a minimal set of topological generators, a subset of which generates N as a closed normal subgroup (cf. § 4).
On the one hand, Theorem 1.1 gives a necessary condition which is satisfied by cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-p groups -- and which can be employed to check if an oriented pro-p group is cohomologically Kummerian, by reducing the problem to a quotient which may be easier to handle. On the other hand, we use Theorem 1.1 to prove Theorem 1.2 below. Recall that an oriented pro-p group G = (G, ) comes endowed with the distinguished closed normal subgroup

(1.3)

K(G) = h-(g)ghg-1 g  G, h  Ker()  Ker(),

(cf. [13, § 3]). The following is the extention of the group-theoretic characterization of cohomologically Kummerian pro-p pairs obtained in [13] to non-finitely generated pro-p groups (see [13, Thm. 5.6, Thm. 7.1, Thm. 7.7]).

Theorem 1.2. Let G = (G, ) be an oriented pro-p group, and if p = 2 assume further that Im()  1 + 4Z2. The following four conditions are equivalent.
(i) G is cohomologically Kummerian. (ii) The quotient G/K(G) of G is a torsion-free pro-p group -- i.e., G is Kummerian
in the sense of [13]. (iii) If N is a closed normal subgroup of G satisfying N  K(G), then the oriented
pro-p group G¯ = (G/N, ¯), with ¯: G/N  1 + pZp induced by , is cohomologically Kummerian. (iv) K(G) is the intersection of the preimages of 0 via all continuous 1-cocycles c : G  Zp() which factor through a finitely generated quotient of G.

In particular, the definition of cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-p group and the group-theoretic definition of Kummerian oriented pro-p group, given in [13, Def. 3.4], are equivalent also in the case of non-finitely generated pro-p groups (see Remark 3.4).

Remark 1.3. If p = 2 and K is a field, then the image of the cyclotomic character K,2 is contained in 1 + 4Z2 if, and only if, -1  K. Thus, the assumption that Im() is contained in 1 + 4Z2 is rather natural from an arithmetic point of wiew.
Finally, we outline possible strategy one can follow to pursue concrete examples of pro-p groups which cannot complete into 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p group. Following this strategy, we established a new family of pro-p groups which cannot be completed into 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p groups.

Theorem 1.4. Let p be an odd prime, and let G be a pro-p group with pro-p presentation

(1.4)

G = x, y0, . . . , yd1 , z0, . . . , zd2 | r1 = r2 = 1 ,

where d1, d2 are non-negative even integers such that d1 + d2  2, and

(1.5) r1 = y0p[y0, x][y1, y2] · · · [yd1-1, yd1],

r2 = z0p[z0, x][z1, z2] · · · [zd1-1, zd1 ].

Then G cannot be completed into a 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p group. Hence, G does not occur as an absolute Galois group.

CLAUDIO QUADRELLI

The pro-p groups described in Theorem 1.4 cannot be ruled out as absolute Galois groups employing other known cohomological methods. Indeed, the Z/p-cohomology algebra of the maximal pro-p Galois group of a field containing a primitive p-th root of unity is quadratic by the Norm Residue Theorem (see, e.g., [4, § 8] and [27, § 2]), and it has the triple Massey vanishing property (as proved by Efrat-Matzri, and independently by Minac-Ta^n, see [11, 23]) and the p-cyclic Massey vanishing properties (as proved by R. Sharifi, see [37]) -- for an overview on Massey products in Galois cohomology see [24]. The Z/p-cohomology algebra of a pro-p group as in Theorem 1.4 satisfies all these three properties (see § 7). Hence, Theorem 1.4 provides brand new examples of pro-p groups which do not occur as absolute Galois groups.
Moreover, the pro-p groups described in Theorem 1.4 are amalgamated free pro-p products of Demushkin groups, with pro-p-cyclic amalgam: it is worth observing that, despite Demushkin groups and their free pro-p products are some of the (rather few) examples of pro-p groups which are known to complete into 1-cyclotomic pro-p pairs (see Example 2.3), the presence of a pro-p-cyclic amalgam is sufficient to lose 1-cyclotomicity. This fact corroborates the restrictivity of 1-cyclotomicity.
Altogether, 1-cyclotomicity of oriented pro-p groups provides a rather powerful (and relatively novel) tool for understanding the structural properties of absolute Galois groups, which succeeds in detecting pro-p groups which are not absolute Galois groups when other methods fail, as underlined above. We believe that further investigations in this direction will lead to new obstructions for the realization of pro-p groups as absolute Galois groups.
Remark 1.5. Most of the research carried out in this manuscript was originally made public in the preprint [30], published on arXiv in April 2019, and submitted to a referred journal (in particular, Theorems 1.1­1.2 are [30, Thm. 1.1­1.2]). The (somewhat syncopated) review process lasted more than two years, and it ended with the rejection of the paper. Subsequently, we decided to split the original paper, and this manuscript is one of the two resulting pieces. In the meanwhile, the research on 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p groups went on, and Theorems 1.1­ 1.2 have been used for proving results in [3, 29, 32].

2. Oriented pro-p groups and 1-cyclotomicity
Notation. Throughout the paper, every subgroup of a pro-p group is tacitly assumed to be closed with respect to the pro-p topology. Therefore, sets of generators of pro-p groups, and presentations, are to be intended in the topological sense. Given a pro-p group G, we denote the closed commutator subgroup of G -- i.e., the closed normal subgroup generated by commutators
[h, g] = h-1 · hg = h-1 · g-1hg, g, h  G
-- by G; the Frattini subgroup of G -- i.e., the closed normal subgroup generated by G and by p-powers gp, g  G (cf. [7, Prop. 1.13]) -- is denoted by (G).

2.1. Definition and examples. Recall that 1 + pZp = {1 + p |   Zp} is a multiplicative abelian pro-p group. In particular, if p is odd then 1 + pZp  Zp (the latter being considered as an additive pro-p group), and 1 + pZp is torsion-free; while if p = 2 then

(2.1)

1 + 2Zp = {±1} × (1 + 4Z2) = (Z/2)  Z2

1-CYCLOTOMIC ORIENTED PRO-p GROUPS

(the latter being considered as an additive pro-2 group). Following [31], we call a pair G = (G, ), consisting of a pro-p group G together with
a morphism of pro-p groups  : G  1 + pZp, an oriented pro-p group, and the morphism  is called an orientation of G. (In [9,13], an oriented pro-p group is called a "cyclotomic pro-p pair" -- for the motivation of the name "orientation", see the footnote at the end of p. 1885 in [31].) An orientation  : G  1 + pZp is said to be torsion-free if the group Im() is torsion-free (cf. [13, § 2]) -- namely, if p = 2 then by (2.1) we require that Im()  1 + 4Z2. Observe that one may have an oriented pro-p group G = (G, ) where G has non-trivial torsion and  torsion-free (e.g., if G  Z/p and Im() = {1}).

Remark 2.1. An oriented pro-p group G = (G, ) yields a G-module Zp()/p which is isomorphic to Z/p as a trivial G-module, as (g)  1 mod p for all g  G. Therefore, the right-side term in (1.2) is isomorphic to H1(G, Z/p), and altogether one has isomorphisms of p-elementary abelian groups

(2.2)

H1(G, Zp()/p)  H1(G, Z/p)  (G/(G)),

where  denotes the Z/p-dual (cf., e.g., [36, Ch. I, § 4.2]). Similarly, if p = 2 and  is a torsion-free orientation, then Z2()/4 is a trivial G-module isomorphic to Z/4, as (g)  1 mod 4 for all g  G.

A morphism of oriented pro-p groups G1  G2, with Gi = (Gi, i) for i = 1, 2, is a homomorphism of pro-p groups  : G1  G2 such that 1 = 2   (cf. [31, § 3, p. 1888]). In the family of oriented pro-p groups one has the following constructions. Let G = (G, ) be an oriented pro-p group.

(a) If N is a normal subgroup of G contained in Ker(), one has the oriented pro-p group

(2.3)

G/N = (G/N, ¯),

where ¯: G/N  1+pZp is the orientation such that ¯ = , with  : G  G/N the canonical projection. (b) If A is an abelian pro-p group (written multiplicatively), one has the oriented pro-p pair

(2.4)

A  G = (A  G, ~),

with action given by gag-1 = a(g) for every g  G, a  A, where the orientation ~: A  G  1 + pZp is the composition of the canonical projection A  G  G
with  (this construction was introduced by I. Efrat in [9, § 3]).

We say that a pro-p group G may be completed into a cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-p group, respectively a 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p group, if there exists an orientation  : G  1 + pZp such that the oriented pro-p group G = (G, ) is cohomologically Kummerian, respectively 1-cyclotomic.

Remark 2.2. (a) 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p groups where introduced independently by M. Florence and C. De Clerq in [6], with the name "1-smooth pro-p groups". They also conjecture that the surjectivity of the norm residue morphism in the Galois cohomology of the maximal pro-p Galois group GK(p) of a field K (i.e., the "surjective half" of the Bloch-Kato conjecture) follows from

6

CLAUDIO QUADRELLI

the fact that the oriented pro-p group GK,p is 1-cyclotomic (cf. [6, Conj. 14.25], see also [30]). (b) The original definition of 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p group requires only that for every open subgroup U of G, the oriented pro-p group GU = (U, |U ) is cohomologically Kummerian (cf. [31, § 1]). By a continuity argument, this is enough to imply that also for every closed subgroup H of G, the oriented pro-p group GH = (H, |H ) is cohomologically Kummerian (cf. [31, Cor. 3.2]).

The following is an exaustive list of all pro-p groups which are known to complete into 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p groups with torsion-free orientation.

Example 2.3. (a) Let G be a free pro-p group. Then the oriented pro-p group G = (G, ) is 1-cyclotomic for any orientation  : G  1 + pZp (cf. [31, § 2.2]).
(b) Let G be an infinite Demushkin group (cf., e.g., [25, Def. 3.9.9]). By [16, Thm. 4], G comes endowed with a canonical orientation  : G  1 + pZp which is the only one completing G into a 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p group (see also [31, Thm. 6.8]).
(c) Let G = (G, ) be a 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p group. If A is a free abelian pro-p group, also the oriented pro-p group A  G is 1-cyclotomic (cf. [31, Thm. 1.4­ (c)]).
(d) Let G1 = (G1, 1) and G2 = (G2, 2) be two 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p group. The free product G1 G2 = (G1 G2, ), where G1 G2 is the free pro-p product of G1, G2, and  : G1  G2  1 + pZp is induced by 1, 2 (cf. [31, § 3.4]), is again a 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p group (cf. [31, Thm. 1.4­(b)])

The oriented pro-p groups described in Example 2.3 above are precisely the oriented pro-p groups of elementary type with torsion-free orientation, defined by I. Efrat in [9, § 3] (see also [31, § 7.5]).
From the following (cf. [13, Ex. 3.5]), one may recover the Artin-Schreier obstruction as a consequence of 1-smoothness.

Proposition 2.4. Let G be a finite p-group. Then an oriented pro-p group G = (G, ) is 1-cyclotomic if, and only if, p = 2, G is a cyclic group of order 2, and Im() = {±1}.

2.2. The Galois case. As stated in the Introduction, the most important examples of 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p groups come from Galois theory. Given a field K containing a primitive p-th root of 1, for every n  1 put

µpn =   K¯ s | pn = 1

and µp = µpn .
n1

Since µp  K, µp is contained in the maximal p-extension K(p) of K. Thus, the maximal pro-p Galois group GK(p) acts on µp , and since the group Aut(µp /µp) of all automorphisms of µp fixing µp is isomorphic to 1 + pZp, this action induces the cyclotomic character K,p : GK(p)  1+pZp, defined as in (1.1) (see also [25, Def. 7.3.6]). In particular, if p = 2 then K,2 is a torsion-free orientation if, and only if, -1  K (cf. Remark 1.3).
For every n  1 one has an isomorphism of continuous GK(p)-modules µpn  Zp(K,p)/pn. Let K× and K(p)× denote the multiplicative groups of units of K and K(p)

1-CYCLOTOMIC ORIENTED PRO-p GROUPS

respectively. By Hilbert 90, the short exact sequence of continuous GK(p)-modules

where the left-side and the central vertical arrows are induced by the pn-1-th power map pn : K(p)×  K(p)×, and the right-side vertical arrow is induced by the epimorphism of GK(p)-modules Zp(K,p)/pn  Zp(K,p)/p  Z/p. Therefore, also the right-side vertical arrow is surjective (see also [16, p. 131]). Hence, the oriented pro-p group
GK,p = (GK(p), K,p) is cohomologically Kummerian, and thus also 1-cyclotomic, as every closed subgroup of GK(p) is the maximal pro-p Galois group of an extension of K
(see also [6, Prop. 14.19] and [31, Thm. 1.1]).

3. The subgroup K(G)

Let G = (G, ) be an oriented pro-p group. The subgroup K(G) of G is a normal subgroup of G, and one has

(3.1)

K(G)  Ker() and Ker()  K(G)

(cf. [13, § 3]), so that Ker()/K(G) is an abelian pro-p group. Moreover, if the orientation  : G  1 + pZp is constantly equal to 1, then K(G) = G. By (1.3), for every g  G and h  Ker() one has the equivalence

(3.2)

ghg-1  h(g) mod K(G).

If  is a torsion-free orientation, then either G = Ker(), or G/ Ker()  Zp, which is a p-projective pro-p group (cf., e.g., [36, Ch. I, § 5.9, Cor. 2]). Therefore, the short exact sequence of pro-p groups

{1}

/ Ker()/K(G)

/ G/K(G)

/ G/ Ker()

/ {1}

splits, and by (3.2) the oriented pro-p group G/K(G) splits as semi-direct product in the sense of (2.4), namely, one has

(3.3)

G/K(G)  Ker()/K(G)  G/ Ker()

(cf. [13, Prop. 3.3]).

K( p K) denote the compositum (GK) is the maximal pro-p Galois K(GK) is conjectured to be a free

pro-p group for every such K (cf. [26, Conj. 1.2] and [32]).

The following notion was introduced in [27, § 1].

Definition 3.2. An oriented pro-p group G = (G, ), with  a torsion-free orientation, is said to be -abelian if Ker() is a free abelian pro-p group, and G  Ker()  G/ Ker().

8

CLAUDIO QUADRELLI

Observe that if G = (G, ) is a -abelian oriented pro-p group, then ghg-1 = h(g) for every g  G and h  Ker(), and thus K(G) = {1}.
One has the following characterization of cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-p groups yielding a finitely generated pro-p group (cf. [13, Thm. 5.6 and Thm. 7.1]).
Theorem 3.3. Let G = (G, ) be a finitely generated oriented pro-p group, with  a torsion-free orientation. The following conditions are equivalent.
(i) G is cohomologically Kummerian. (ii) Ker()/K(G) is a free abelian pro-p group. (iii) G/K(G) = (G/K(G), ¯) is ¯-abelian.
Therefore, a -abelian oriented pro-p group G = (G, ), with G finitely generated, is cohomologically Kummerian, as Ker()/K(G) = Ker() is a free abelian pro-p group.
Remark 3.4. In the original definition given in [13, Def. 3.4], an oriented pro-p group G = (G, ) is said to be Kummerian if the quotient Ker()/K(G) is torsion-free. By Theorem 3.3 this original definition and the "cohomological" definition given in the Introduction -- i.e., the morphism (1.2) is surjective for every n  1 -- are equivalent if G is finitely generated and  is torsion-free. As promised in the introduction, Theorem 1.2 (proved in § 5) will extend Theorem 3.3 to the infinitely generated case.

4. Quotients and 1-cocycles

4.1. Continuous 1-cocyles. Let G = (G, ) be an oriented pro-p group. A continuous map c : G  Zp()/pn, with n  N  {} (with the convention that p = 0), is called a 1-cocycle if

(4.1)

c(g1 · g2) = c(g1) + (g1) · c(g2)

for every g1, g2  G (cf., e.g., [25, Ch. I, § 2]). In particular, the restriction of c on Ker() is a homomorphism of pro-p groups. We will need the notion of continuous 1-cocycle (and the following three lemmas) for the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Lemma 4.1. Let G = (G, ) be a cyclotomic pro-p pair, and let c : G  Zp()/pn be a continuous 1-cocycle, with n  N  {}. Then c-1(0)  Ker() is a closed normal
subgroup of G.

Proof. First, {0}  Zp()/pn is open, and hence by continuity of c also c-1(0) is open (and thus closed), and c-1(0)  Ker() is closed.
By [13, Lemma 6.1], 1  c-1(0)  Ker(). For g1, g2  c-1(0), (4.1) yelds c(g1g2) = 0. If g  G and h  c-1(0)  Ker(), then by [13, Lemma 6.1]
c(g-1hg) = c(g-1) + (g)-1(c(h) + (h)c(g))
= c(g-1) + (g)-1(0 + c(g))
= -(g)-1c(g) + (g)-1c(g) = 0,
and this completes the proof.

The following lemma is almost straightforward.

Lemma 4.2. Let G = (G, ) be a cyclotomic pro-p pair, and let N  G be a normal
subgroup such that N  Ker(), with canonical projection  : G  G/N . Put G/N = (G/N, ¯). For n  N  {} one has the following:
(i) a continuous 1-cocycle c : G  Zp()/pn with c|N  0 induces a continuous 1-cocycle c¯: G/N  Zp(¯)/pn such that c = c¯  ;
(ii) a continuous 1-cocycle c¯: G/N  Zp(¯)/pn induces a continuous 1-cocycle c : G  Zp()/pn with c|N  0 such that c = c¯  .

Proof. For every g  G one has c¯(gN ) = c(g). Thus, equality (4.1) holds for c if, and only if, it holds for c¯.

The next lemma (cf. [21, Lemma 3.2]) is a variant of [16, Prop. 6] to the case where G is not (necessarily) finitely generated -- we copy the statement here for the convenience of the reader.

Lemma 4.3. Let G = (G, ) be a cohomologically Kummerian pro-p pair. Then for all n  N  {} one may arbitrarily prescribe the values of continuous 1-cocycles G  Zp()/pn on a minimal system of generators of G provided that for all but a finite number of generators these values are 0 -- i.e., such 1-cocycles factor through a finitely generated quotient of G.

4.2. Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let G = (G, ) be a cyclotomic pro-p pair. We focus now on normal subgroups N of G, satisfying the following three conditions:

(C1) N  Ker(); (C2) G/N is a finitely generated pro-p group; (C3) the restriction map

induced by the inclusion N  G, is surjective. Recall that one has an isomorphism H1(N, Z/p)G  (N/N p[N, G]) of discrete pelementary abelian groups (cf. [36, Ch. I, § 4.3]). By duality, condition (C3) holds -- i.e., (4.2) is surjective -- if and only if the morphism

(4.3)

N/N p[N, G] - G/(G),

induced by N  G, is injective. Moreover, since N/N p[N, G] and G/(G) are pelementary abelian groups, conditions (C1)­(C3) hold if, and only if, one may find a minimal system of generators X of G such that N is generated as a normal subgroup by a cofinite subset Y  X, and such that Y  Ker().
We are ready to prove Theorem 1.1.

Theorem 4.4. Let G = (G, ) be a cohomologically Kummerian torsion-free pro-p pair, and let N  G be a normal subgroup satisfying the three conditions (C1)­(C3). Then also G/N is cohomologically Kummerian.

Proof. For every n  1, the canonical projection  : G  G/N induces the inflation

maps

(4.4)

fn : H1(G/N, Zp()/pn) - H1(G, Zp()/pn), f : H1(G/N, Z/p) - H1(G, Z/p),

which are injective by [25, Prop. 1.6.7]. Also, the epimorphism Zp()/pn  Z/p (considered respectively as continuous G/N - and G-modules), induces morphisms

(4.5)

nN : H1(G/N, Zp()/pn) - H1(G/N, Z/p), n : H1(G, Zp()/pn) - H1(G, Z/p).

Altogether, by [25, Prop. 1.5.2] one has the commutative diagram

H1 (G/N, Zp()/pn) nN / H1(G/N, Z/p)

fn
 H1 (G, Zp()/pn)

f
 n / / H1(G, Z/p)

Since G is Kummerian, n is surjective for every n  1. Given ¯  H1(G/N, Z/p), ¯ = 0, our goal is to find   H1(G/N, Zp()/pn) such that nN () = ¯.
Set  = ¯   = f (¯). Then  : G  Z/p is a non-trivial continuous homomorphism
such that Ker()  N . Since N satisfies conditions (C1)­(C3), one may find a minimal
system of generators X of G such that Y = X  N generates N as closed normal
subgroup, and X Y is finite. By Lemma 4.3, there exists a continuous 1-cocycle c : G  Zp()/pn satisfying

c(x)  (x) mod p for every x  X

-- i.e., n([c]) =  (where [c]  H1(G, Zp()/pn) denotes the cohomology class of c) --, and moreover c(x) = 0 for every x  Y . Therefore, by Lemma 4.1, the restriction c|N : N  Zp()/pn is the 0 map. By Lemma 4.2, c induces a continuous 1-cocycle c¯: G/N  Zp()/pn such that c¯   = c, and [c] = fn([c¯]) (where [c¯]  H1(G/N, Zp()/pn) denotes the cohomology class of c¯). Altogether, one has
f (¯) =  = n([c]) = n  fn([c¯]) = f  nN ([c¯]).
Since f is injective, one obtains ¯ = nN ([c¯]).

5. Infinitely generated pro-p groups

One has the following criterion to check cohomological Kummerianity of an oriented pro-p group (cf. [31, Cor. 3.3]).

Proposition 5.1. Let (S, ) be a directed set, let G = (G, ) be oriented pro-p group with  a torsion-free orientation, and let (Ns)sS be a family of closed normal subgroups of G satisfying Nt  Ns  Ker() for any s t, and such that
(i) sS Ns = {1}; (ii) G/Ns is cohomologically Kummerian for all s  S.
Then also G is cohomologically Kummerian.

From Proposition 5.1 one deduces the following.

Proposition 5.2. Let G = (G, ) be a -abelian pro-p pair. Then G is cohomologically Kummerian.

1-CYCLOTOMIC ORIENTED PRO-p GROUPS

Proof. By hypothesis G  AG/ Ker(), with A a free abelian pro-p group, i.e., A  ZIp for some set I. Let {xi, i  I} be a minimal system of generators of A, and set
S = { J  I | I J is finite }.
Then (S, ) is a directed set, with J J if J  J. For every J  S, let NJ be the normal subgroup of A generated by {xj, j  J}. Then for every J  S one has
G/NJ  Znp  G/ Ker(), n = |I J |, which is cohomologically Kummerian, and moreover NJ  NJ  Ker() for J  J, and J NJ = {1}. Hence, G is cohomologically Kummerian by Proposition 5.1.
Remark 5.3. Let G = (G, ) be a -abelian oriented pro-p group. Then for every subgroup H  G, the oriented pro-p group GH = (H, |H ) is |H -abelian (cf. e.g., [5, Prop. 3.2]), and thus it is cohomologically Kummerian. Therefore, G is a 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p group.

Let G = (G, ) be an oriented pro-p group. We will need the following technical lemma throughout the proof of Theorem 5.5 below, to jump back and forth between normal subgroups of the pro-p group G and of its quotient G/K(G).

Lemma 5.4. Let G = (G, ) be a oriented pro-p group with  a torsion-free orientation.
(i) Suppose that K(G) = {1}, and let N be a subgroup of Ker(). Then the map (4.2) is surjective if, and only if, N  Ker() yields a monomorphism of pelementary abelian pro-p groups N/N p  Ker()/ Ker()p.
(ii) Let N¯ be a normal subgroup of G/K(G) satisfying conditions (C1)­(C3) with respect to the oriented pro-p group G/K(G), and let
{ yiK(G) | i  I }  Ker()/K(G)
be a minimal generating set of N¯ . Then the normal subgroup N of G, generated by {yi | i  I} as a normal subgroup, satisfies conditions (C1)­(C3) with respect to the oriented pro-p group G, and moreover N K(G)/K(G) = N¯ .

Proof. If K(G) is trivial, then Ker() is abelian, and G  Ker()  G/ Ker() (cf. (3.3)). In particular, one has [Ker(), G]  Ker()p, and similarly [N, G]  N p for every subgroup N  Ker(). Therefore, on the one hand one has (G)  Ker()p  Im()p, so
that

(5.1)

G/(G)  Ker()/ Ker()p × Im()/ Im()p.

On the other hand, for N as above one has

(5.2)

H1(N, Z/p)G  (N/N p[N, G]) = (N/N p).

Hence, by duality the map res1G,N (cf. (4.2)) is surjective if, and only if, the morphism of p-elementary abelian pro-p groups N/N p  Ker()/ Ker()p, induced by the inclusion N  Ker(), is injective. This completes the proof of (i).
Now let N¯ be a normal subgroup of G/K(G) satisfying conditions (C1)­(C3) with
respect to G/K(G). Then
G/K(G)  (A × N¯ )  G/ Ker()

-- cf. (3.3) -- for some finitely generated abelian pro-p group A. Since K(G)  (G), there exists a minimal generating set {x0, x1, ..., xr, yi | i  I} of G (where we set x0 = 1 if G/ Ker() = {1}) such that the cosets x1K(G), . . . , xrK(G) lie in A. Let N be the normal subgroup of G generated by {yi, i  I} as a normal subgroup. Then N  Ker(), as K(G)  Ker() as well, G/N is generated by {x0N, . . . , xrN }, and
N K(G)/K(G) = yiK(G) | i  I = N¯ .

Moreover,

N¯ /N¯ p  N/N p[N, G]  yi(G) | i  I  (Z/p)I ,

so that also N/N p[N, G] embeds in G/(G), and thus by duality res1G,N is surjective. This completes the proof of (ii).

Theorem 5.5. Let G = (G, ) be am oriented pro-p groups with  a torsion-free orientation. The following conditions are equivalent.
(i) G is cohomologically Kummerian. (ii) The pro-p group Ker()/K(G) is torsion-free. (iii) The oriented pro-p group G/K(G) = (G/K(G), ¯) is ¯-abelian.

Proof. Assume first that the abelian pro-p group A¯ := Ker()/K(G) is not torsion-free.

Then

A¯  Zp/pkiZp, with ki  N  {} for all i  I,

iI
for some set I (with the convention that p = 0) such that ki <  for some i. Let N¯ be a subgroup of A¯ such that A¯/N¯ is finite, and the inclusion N¯  A¯ induces a monomorphism of p-elementary abelian pro-p groups N¯ /N¯ p  A¯/A¯p. By Lemma 5.4­ (i), N¯ satisfies conditions (C1)­(C3) with respect to the oriented pro-p group G/K(G).

In particular,

(G/K(G))/N¯  (A¯/N¯ )  G/ Ker().

Let N be a normal subgroup of G satisfies conditions (C1)­(C3) with respect to the oriented pro-p group G and such that N K(G)/K(G) = N¯ , whose existence is granted by
Lemma 5.4­(ii). Then Ker()/N K(G)  B, and this yields the isomorphisms of finitely
generated oriented pro-p groups

G /K (G ) N¯



G/N K(G/N )



(A¯/N¯ )



(G/

Ker()).

Since A¯/N¯ is not torsion-free, G/N is not Kummerian by Theorem 3.3. Therefore, G is
not cohomologically Kummerian by Theorem 4.4. Hence, (i) implies (ii). Conversely, assume that A¯ := Ker()/K(G) is torsion-free, i.e., A¯  ZIp for some set
I. Let {xiK(G) | xi  G, i  I} be a minimal generating set of A¯, and set

S = { J  I | I J is finite }.

Then (S, ) is a directed set, with J J if J  J. For every J  S, let N¯J be the normal subgroup of A¯ generated by {xjK(G) | j  J}. Then for every J  S, the subgroup N¯J satisfies conditions (C1)­(C3) with respect to the oriented pro-p group
G/K(G). Moreover,

(5.3)

(G/K(G))/N¯J  Znp  G/ Ker(), n = |I J|,

i.e., (G/K(G))/N¯J is a finitely generated cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-p group.
Now, for every J  S let NJ be the normal subgroup of G generated by {yj | j  J}. Then by Lemma 5.4­(ii) NJ satisfies conditions (C1)­(C3) with respect to the oriented pro-p group G, and one has NJ K(G)/K(G) = N¯J . Moreover, for every J  J one has NJ  NJ , and JS NJ = {1}. Finally, for every J  S one has
G/NJ  (Ker()/NJ )  G/ Ker()  (A¯/N¯J )G/ Ker()  (G/K(G))/N¯J ,
which cohomologically Kummerian by (5.3). Hence, applying Proposition 5.1 yields (i). The equivalence between (ii) and (iii) follows by (3.3).

From Theorem 5.5 we may deduce the following two corollaries, which are generalizations of [13, Thm. 5.6] and of [13, Thm. 7.7] respectively.

Corollary 5.6. Let G = (G, ) be an oriented pro-p group with  a torsion-free orientation, and let N  G a normal subgroup contained in K(G). Then G is Kummerian if, and only if, G/N is Kummerian.

Proof. Let ¯: G/N  1 + pZp be the orientation induced by . Since N  K(G), one has that K(G/N ) = K(G)/N . Therefore, one has isomorphisms

Ker(¯) K(G/N )



G Ker()



G/N K(G/N )



G/N K (G )/N



G K (G )



Ker() K (G )



G Ker()

,

and hence Ker(¯)/K(G/N ) is torsion-free if, and only if, Ker()/K(G), and the claim follows from Theorem 5.5.

Lemma 5.7. Let G = (G, ) be a -abelian oriented pro-p group. Then for every g  G, g = 1, there exists a continuous 1-cocycle c : G  Zp() such that c(g) = 0.

Proof. If G is finitely generated, then this is a consequence of [13, Thm. 7.7].

By Proposition 5.2, G is (cohomologically) Kummerian. Put G = A  G/ Ker() with

A a free abelian pro-p group, let {xi | i  I} be a minimal generating set of A, and pick

x  G such that (x) generates Im(), if  is not trivial. Then for any g  G one may

write

g = x · xi i
iI

for some , i  Zp.

For j  I let c : G  Zp() and cj : G  Zp() be the continuous 1-cocycles such that

c(x) = 1 and c(xi) = 0 for every i  I, and cj(xj) = 1 and cj(x) = c(xj ) = 0 for every i  I, i = j. Then by [13, Lemma 6.1] one has

c(g)

=

0,

cj (g) = cj (x ) + (x) · icj (xi) = 0 + (x) · j .
iI

Therefore, if g = 1 then c(g) = 0 or cj(g) = 0, for some j  I.

Corollary 5.8. Let G = (G, ) be a Kummerian oriented pro-p group with  a torsionfree orientation. Then G is Kummerian if, and only if,

(5.4)

K(G) =

c-1({0}),

c : GZp()

14

CLAUDIO QUADRELLI

where c runs through all continuous 1-cocycles c : G  Zp() which factor through a finitely generated quotient of G.
Proof. Assume that (5.4) holds. By Theorem 5.5, to show that G is Kummerian is enough to show that Ker()/K(G) is torsion-free -- for this, we follow verbatim the first half of the proof of [13, Thm. 7.7]. Take g  Ker() such that gpn  K(G) for some n  0. Then for any continuous 1-cocycle c : G  Zp(), one has c(gpn) = 0 by hypothesis. From [13, Lemma 6.1] one deduces
0 = c gpn = pn · c(g),
and hence c(g) = 0. Therefore, g  K(G) by hypothesis. Conversely, assume G is Kummerian. By [13, Lemma 6.1], for every g  G and
h  Ker() one has
c h-(g)ghg-1 = -(g)c(h) + c(g) + (g) c(h) + c(g-1) = 0,
and thus c c-1({0})  K(G). On the other hand, the oriented pro-p group G/K(G) = (G/K(G), ¯) is ¯-abelian by Theorem 5.5. By Lemma 5.7, for any g  G K(G) there exists a continuous 1-cocycle c¯: G/K(G)  Zp(¯) such that c¯(gN ) = 0. By Lemma 4.2­ (ii), the continuous 1-cocycle c¯ induces a continuous 1-cocycle c : G  Zp() such that c(g) = 0, and thus g / c c-1({0}).
Theorem 1.2 is the sum of Theorem 5.5 and Corollaries 5.6­5.8.

6. Non-1-cyclotomizable pro-p groups
6.1. Strategy and examples. Given a pro-p group G, with a presentation in terms of generators and defining relations, one has the following strategy to show that G cannot be completed into a 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p group:
(a) first, one shows what an orientation  : G  1 + pZp should be like, in order to complete G into a cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-p group G = (G, ), employing Lemma 4.3; if such an orientation  does not exists (as done, e.g., in [13, Thm. 8.1]), we are done, otherwise...
(b) ... one chases a subgroup H of G such that the oriented pro-p group GH = (H, |H ) is not cohomologically Kummerian (and this is proved, tipically, using Theorems 1.1­1.2, or [13, Thm. 8.1]).
In this section we present three examples of families of of pro-p groups which are shown not to complete into a 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p group with torsion-free orientation, following the above strategy. The first two examples have been sorted out in [29] and in [3] (where one may find the detailed tractations), while the third one is a new example, and it yields Theorem 1.4.
Remark 6.1. If a pro-p group G cannot complete into a 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p group G = (G, ), with  a torsion-free orientation, then clearly G does not occur as the maximal pro-p Galois group GK(p) of a field K containing a primitive p-th root of 1, and also -1 if p = 2. This is enough to imply that G does not occur also as a pro-p Sylow subgroup of the absolute Galois group of any field (without any assumptions on the roots of 1 contained in the base field), and thus as absoulte Galois group, too (cf. [29, Rem. 3.3]).

1-CYCLOTOMIC ORIENTED PRO-p GROUPS

15

The first example is taken from [29, Thm. 1.1].

Example 6.2. Let d be an odd integer such that d  3, and let G be the torsion-free pro-p group with presentation

G = x1, . . . , xd | xq1[x1,n x2][x2, x3] · · · [xd-1, xd] = 1, n  2, q  pZp ,

where

[x1,n x2] = [. . . [[x1, x2], x2], . . . , x2].

n times
If  : G  1+pZp is an orientation which completes G into a cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-p group G = (G, ), then by Lemma 4.3 one has that q = 0 and (xi) = 1 for i = 2, . . . , d (cf. [29, Prop. 3.4]). Let H be the kernel of the homomorphism of pro-p groups G  Z/p defined by xi  0 for i = 1, 3, . . . , d and x2  1, and let N be the normal subgroup of H generated by {[xi,k x2] | i = 3, . . . , d, k  0}. Then N satisfies conditions (C1)­(C3) with respect to the oriented pro-p group GH = (H, |H ) but H/N cannot complete into a cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-p group (cf. [29, Prop. 3.6]). Therefore, GH is not cohomologically Kummerian by Theorem 1.1 if G is cohomologically Kummerian, and thus G is not 1-cyclotomic.

The next example is taken from [3, Thm. 5.6].

Example 6.3. Let G be the torsion pro-p group with presentation

(6.1)

G = x, y2, y2 | [x, y1] = y1q, [x, y2] = y2q, q  pZp

with the further assumption that 4 | q if p = 2. If  : G  1 + pZp is an orientation
completing G into a cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-p group G = (G, ), then
by Lemma 4.3 one has that (x) = 1 + q and (y1) = (y2) = 1 (cf. [3, Thm. 4.6]). Let H be the subgroup of G generated by the set {xp, y1q, y2q, y1y2-1}, and consider the oriented pro-p pair GH = (H, |H ). Then in the quotient Ker(|H )/K(GH ) one has the
non-trivial relation

(6.2)

y1y2-1  · (y1q)1 · (y2q)2  1 mod K(GH )

for some , 1, 2  pZp, i.e., Ker(|H )/K(GH ) has non-trivial torsion, and thus GH is not cohomologically Kummerian by Theorem 1.2 (cf. [3, Thm. 5.6], the proof relies also on Theorem 1.1). Hence G = (G, ) is not 1-cyclotomic.

6.2. New examples. Let G a pro-p group as in Theorem 1.4. Namely, G has a pre-

sentation (1.4) with defining relations

(6.3)

r1 = y0p[y0, x-1][y1, y2] · · · [yd1-1, yd1], r2 = z0p[z0, x-1][z1, z2] · · · [zd2-1, zd2 ]

-- recall that d1 and d2 are even non-negative integers, and at least one of them is positive.

First of all, we show that G is torsion-free.

Lemma 6.4. For every n  3 one has Hn(G, Z/p) = 0, and G is torsion-free.

16

CLAUDIO QUADRELLI

Proof. By [28, § 3.2], the shape of the defining relations (6.3) implies that Hn(G, Z/p) =
0 for every n  3. In particular, G is torsion-free: indeed, if G contained a cyclic subgroup C of order p, then one would have Hn(C, Z/p) = 0 (cf. [25, Prop. 1.7.1]) -- and thus also Hn(G, Z/p) = 0 (cf. [25, Prop. 3.3.5]) -- for every n  0.

Let G1 and G2 be respectively the subgroups of G generated by {x, yi | 0  i  d1} and {x, zj | 0  j  d2}, and put Z = x (so Z  Zp as G is torsion-free). Then G1 and G2 are Demushkin groups, and G decomposes as amalgamated free pro-p product

(6.4)

G  G1 Z G2,

with amalgam Z -- for an overview on free pro-p products and amalgamated free pro-p product see [34, § 9.1­2]. Then the amalgamated free pro-p product (6.4) is proper as Z  Zp (cf. [33, Thm. 3.2]).
As stated in the strategy above, the first step is to check out which orientation may complete G into a cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-p group. The next lemma is an example of how to employ Lemma 4.3 for this purpose: for this reason, we put a complete proof with detailed computations -- even though these are essentially the same computations carried by Labute in the proof of [16, Thm. 4].

Lemma 6.5. An orientation  : G  1 + pZp completes G into a cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-p group G = (G, ) is, and only if, (x) = 1-p and (yi) = (zj) = 1 for all i = 0, . . . , d1 and j = 0, . . . , d2.

Proof. Clearly, (y0)p = (y0p) = (r1) = (1) = 1, and since Im() is torsion-free, one has (y0) = 1 -- and analogously (z0) = 1.
Suppose first that G is cohomologically Kummerian. By Lemma 4.3 for every i =
0, . . . , d1 and j = 0, . . . , d2 there exist continuous 1-cocycles ci, cj : G  Zp() such that, for all i, j: ci(yi) = 1 and ci(x) = ci(yi ) = c(zj) = 0 for i = i; cj = (zj) = 1 and cj(x) = cj(yi) = cj(zj ) = 0 for j = j. Recall that by [13, Lemma 6.1] for every
g, h  G and every continuous 1-cocyle c : G  Zp() one has

(6.5)

c([g, h]) = (gh)-1 ((1 - (h))c(g) - (1 - (g))c(h)) .

Keeping in mind that G  Ker(), and using (4.1) and (6.5), one computes

(6.6)

ci(r1) = ci(y0p) + c([y0, x-1]) +

c([yi , yi+1])

i =1,3,...,d1 -1



p · 1 + ((x) - 1) · 1 + 0,

if i = 0,

= p · 0 + (yi+1)-1 - 1 · 1, if i  1 and 2  i, p · 0 + -(yi-1)-1 - 1 · 1, if i  1 and 2 | i,

and moreover ci(r2) = 0. Since ci(r1) = ci(1) = 0, from (6.6) one deduces (x) = 1 - p

and (yi) = 0 for every i. Similarly, after replacing ci with cj and r1 with r2 in (??),

one deduces that (zj) = 0 for every j.

Conversely, suppose that  : G  1 + pZp is defined as above, and pick p-adic integers , i, j  Zp for 0  i  d1 and 0  j  d2. Since

(6.7)

p · 0 + ((x) - 1) · 0 = 0 and p · 0 + ((x) - 1) · 0 = 0,

1-CYCLOTOMIC ORIENTED PRO-p GROUPS

17

the assignment x  , yi  i and zj  j for every i, j yields a well-defined continuous 1-cocycle c : G  Zp(), as by (6.7) one has c(r1) = c(r2) = 0. Therefore, G is cohomologically Kummerian by Lemma 4.3.

Henceforth,  : G  1 + pZp will denote the orientation as in Lemma 6.5. Let 1 : G1  Z/p  Z/p and 2 : G2  Z/p  Z/p be the homomorphisms of pro-p groups defined by

1(x) = 2(x) = (1, 0),

(6.8)

1(y0) = 2(z0) = (0, 1),

1(yi) = 2(zj) = (0, 0) for i, j  1.

Put U1 = Ker(1) and U2 = Ker(2), and t = z0-1y0, u = xp, v = y0p, w = z0p. Then U1 is an open normal subgroup of G1 of index p2, and likewise for U2 and G2 -- note that by [8, Thm. 1] both U1 and U2 are Demushkin groups, with canonical orientations |U1 and |U2 respectively (cf. Example 2.3­(b)). Finally, put N1 = Ker(|U1 ) and N2 = Ker(|U2 ) -- note that by [36, Ch.I, § 4.5, Ex. 5­(b)] N1 and N2 are free pro-p groups.
Let H be the subgroup of G generated by U1, U2 and T := t , and let M be the subgroup of H generated by N1, N2 and T . Observe that M  Ker(). Our goal is to show that the oriented pro-p group GH = (H, |H ) is not cohomologically Kummerian.

Lemma 6.6. (i) M = N1  N2  T . (ii) M is a normal subgroup of H, and H  M  Zp
(iii) One has an isomorphism of p-elementary abelian groups

Proof. Consider the pro-p tree T associated to the amalgamated free pro-p product (6.4). Namely, T consists of a set vertices V and a set of edges E, where

V = { hG1, hG2 | h  G } = G/G1  G/G2,

E = { hZ | h  G } = G/Z,

and it comes endowed with a natural G-action such that

g.(hG1) = (gh)G1 for every g  G, hG1  G/G1  V

(6.10)

g.(hG1) = (gh)G2 for every g  G, hG2  G/G2  V,

g.(hZ) = (gh)Z for every g  G, hZ  G/Z = E.

Pick g  M and hZ  E. Then g.hZ = hZ if, and only if, g  hZh-1, i.e., g = hxh-1

for some   Zp. Since M  Ker(), it follows that

and therefore  = 0, as 1+pZp is torsion-free. Hence, the subgroup M intersects trivially with the stabilizer StabG(hZ) of every edge hZ  E. By [18, Thm. 5.6], M decomposes as free pro-p product as follows:

(6.12)

M=

StabM ()  F,

V 

18

CLAUDIO QUADRELLI

where F is a free pro-p group, and V  V is a continuous set of representatives of the space of orbits M \V. Clearly, the vertices G1 and G2 belong to different orbits, thus in the decomposition (6.12) one finds the two factors

StabM (G1) = { g  M | gG1 = G1 } = M  G1,

StabM (G2) = { g  M | gG2 = G2 } = M  G2.

Since N1  M  G1  Ker()  G1 = N1, one has StabM (G1) = N1, and analogously

StabM (G2) = N2. Therefore, from (6.12) one obtains





(6.13)

M = N1  N2  

StabM ()  F  .

V {G1,G2}

It is straightforward to see that t / N1  N2. Since M is generated as pro-p group by N1, N2 and t, the right-side factor in (6.13) is necessarily T , and this proves (i).
In order to prove (ii), we need only to show that uM u-1 = M , as H = u, M . Since N1 is normal in U1, and u  U1, then uN1u-1 = N1 -- analogously, uN2u-1 = N2.
Now, observe that the integer

(1 - p)p - 1 =

1-

p 1

p+

p 2

p2 - . . . - pp

-1

is divisible by p2 (but not by p3), so we put (1 - p)p = 1 + p2, with   1 + pZp. From (6.3) one deduces

(6.14)

xy0x-1 = y01-p · ([y1, y2] · · · [yd1-1, yd1])-1 ,

and by iterating (6.14) p times, one obtains uy0u-1 = y0(1-p)p n1 for some n1  N1 --

for this purpose, observe that for every   0 and i  1, the triple commutator

[y0 , [yi, yi+1]] =

yiy0 , yiy+01

-1
· [yi, yi+1]

belongs to N1 , as y0- · yi · y0  N1. Analogously, uz0u-1 = z0(1-p)pn2 for some n2  N2 . Altogether,

(6.15)

utu-1 = u(z0-1y0)u-1 = uz0-1u-1 uy0u-1 = n-2 1 · w-p · t · vp · n1,

which belongs to M -- here we replaced z0-(1-p)p = w-p · z0-1 and y0(1-p)p = y0 · vp . Hence, M H. Finally, by definition H = M ·Zp, and moreover M Zp  Ker()Zp =

{1}, so that H = M  Zp. This completes the proof of (ii).

Finally, by (i) and (ii) one has the isomorphism of p-elementary abelian groups

(6.16)

M/(M )  N1/(N1) × N2/(N2) × T /T p H/(H)  Zp/Zp2 × M/M p[M, H].

From (6.15) one has that [T, Zp]  (M ), and since H = M Zp, U1 = N1Zp, and U2 = N2Zp, form (6.16) one deduces (iii).

Proof of Theorem 1.4. Let N be the normal subgroup of H generated as a normal subgroup by N1, N2, and set H¯ = H/N . Then N  Ker(|H ), and clearly H¯ is finitely generated. Moreover, by duality the restriction map res1H,N : H1(H, Z/p)  H1(N, Z/p)H is surjective, as by Lemma 6.6 one has
N/N p[N, H]  N1/N1p[N1, U1] × N2/N2p[N2, U2].

1-CYCLOTOMIC ORIENTED PRO-p GROUPS

In particular, {uN, tN } is a minimal generating set of H¯ . Therefore, the normal subgroup N satisfies conditions (C1)­(C3) with respect to the oriented pro-p group GH . Thus, by Theorem 1.1 if the oriented pro-p group GH /N = (H¯ , ¯) is not cohomologically Kummerian, then also GH is not cohomologically Kummerian, and G is not 1-cyclotomic.
By (6.15), in H one has that [t, u-1]  1 mod N , and thus H¯ is abelian. Moreover, ¯(uN ) = (u) = (1 - p)p and ¯(tN ) = (t) = 1, so that Ker(¯) = tN  Zp. Therefore, the subgroup K(GH /N ) is generated by (t-(u)utu-1)N = tp2N . Thus
Ker(¯)/K(GH /N ) = tN / tN p2
is not torsion-free, and by Theorem 1.2, GH /N is not cohomologically Kummerian.

7. Brand new examples

7.1. Quadratic cohomology. In this section, G denotes a pro-p group as in Theorem 1.4. Here we consider the Z/p-cohomology algebra

(7.1)

H·(G, Z/p) = Hn(G, Z/p).

n0

This algebra is a non-negatively, graded, connected Z/p-algebra, endowed with the

graded-commutative cup-product

(7.2)

Hh(G, Z/p) × Hk(G, Z/p) - Hh+k(G, Z/p),

i.e.,    = (-1)hk   (cf. [25, Ch. I, § 4]). If K is a field containing a primitive p-th root of 1, by the Norm Residue Theorem
the algebra H·(GK(p), Z/p) is quadratic, namely, every element of the algebra is the combination of products of elements of degree 1, and the defining relations of the algebra are homogeneous relations of degree 2 (cf., e.g., [4, § 8] or [27, § 2]). This property provides an obstruction for the realization of a pro-p group as the maximal pro-p Galois group of such a field, and it was used to find examples of pro-p groups which do not occur as absolute Galois groups in [4, § 9].
By definition, H0(G, Z/p) = Z/p (cf., e.g., [36, Ch. I, § 2.3, p. 11]). By Remark 2.1, H1(G, Z/p) is isomorphic to the Z/p-dual of G/(G), so that H1(G, Z/p) has a basis

B = { , i, j | 0  i  d1, 0  j  d2 }

where  is the dual of x(G), i the dual of yi(G), and j the dual of zj(G), for every 0  i  d1 and 0  j  d2. As for the group H2(G, Z/p), the set {0, 0}  H2(G, Z/p) is a basis, and one has

  0 = 1  2 = . . . = d1-1  d1 ,

(7.3)

  0 = 1  2 = . . . = d2-1  d2 ,   i =   j = 0 for every 1  i  d1, 1  j  d2,

i  j = 0 for every 0  i  d1, 0  j  d2,

besides the graded-commutativity relation    = -   for every ,   H1(G, Z/p) (cf. [28, § 3.2]). Finally, Hn(G, Z/p) = 0 by Lemma 6.4. Altogether, one has the following (cf. [28, Prop. 3.6]).

20

CLAUDIO QUADRELLI

Proposition 7.1. Let G be a pro-p group as in Theorem 1.4. The Z/p-cohomology algebra H·(G, Z/p) is quadratic.

Therefore, the quadraticity of the Z/p-cohomology algebra cannot be used to rule

out G as the maximal pro-p Galois group of a field containing a primitive p-th root of

1 (and thus neither as an absolute Galois group). One has also the following interpretation for H2(G, Z/p). For an arbitrary finitely

generated pro-p group G, let G = F/R be a minimal presentation, i.e., F is a free pro-p

group and R  (G) -- for example, if G is as in Theorem 1.4, then F is the free pro-p

group generated by {x, yi, zj | 0  i  d1, 0  j  d2} and R is the normal subgroup of F generated by r1 and r2. The epimorphism of pro-p groups F  G induces an isomorphism

(7.4)

trg : H1(R, Z/p)F - H2(G, Z/p)

called transgression (cf. [36, Ch. I, § 4.3]). Observe that H1(R, Z/p)F  (R/Rp[R, F ]). If G is a pro-p group as in Theorem 1.4, then the quotient R/Rp[R, F ] is the 2-
dimensional Z/p-vector space generated by the cosets r¯1 := r1Rp[R, F ] and r¯2 := r2Rp[R, F ]. Let 1, 2  (R/Rp[R, F ]) be dual to r¯1, r¯2, i.e., h(r¯k) = hk. By
[25, Prop. 3.9.13] one has

(7.5)

trg(1) =   0 and trg(2) =   0

(see also [28, § 3.1­3.2]). We will use this fact to prove Proposition 7.5 below.

7.2. Massey products. Let G be a pro-p group. For n  2, the n-fold Massey product on H1(G, Z/p) is a multi-valued map
H1(G, Z/p) × . . . × H1(G, Z/p) - H2(G, Z/p).

n times
For n  2 elements 1, . . . , m of H1(G, Z/p), we write 1, . . . , m for the set of values of the n-fold Massey product of the elements 1, . . . , m. If n = 2, then the 2-fold Massey product coincides with the cup-product, i.e., for 1, 2  H1(G, Z/p) one has
1, 2 = {1  2}  H2(G, Z/p).
For further details on this operation in the profinite and Galois-theoretic context, we direct the reader to [10, 22, 24, 40] and to [29, § 5.1]. In particular, the definition of n-fold Massey products in the Z/p-cohomology of pro-p groups may be found in [24, Def. 2.1]. Here we give only some basic properties, which will be used for the proof of Proposition 7.5.
Given n elements 1, . . . , n  H1(G, Z/p), the n-fold Massey product 1, . . . , n is said to be defined if it is non-empty, and it is said to vanish if it contains 0. In particular, one has 1  2 = . . . = n-1  n = 0 if (and only if, in case n = 3) 1, . . . , n is defined (cf. [40, § 1.2, p. 33]). One has the following (cf. [24, Rem. 2.2]).

Lemma 7.2. Let G be a pro-p group, and let 1, . . . , n be elements of H1(G, Z/p). If the n-fold Massey product 1, . . . , n is defined, then
1, . . . , n   + 1   + n   | ,   H1(G, Z/p) ,
for any value   1, . . . , n .

1-CYCLOTOMIC ORIENTED PRO-p GROUPS

Definition 7.3. (a) A pro-p group G has the triple Massey vanishing property with respect to Z/p if every triple Massey product 1, 2, 3 which is defined vanishes.
(b) A pro-p group G has the p-cyclic Massey vanishing property with respect to Z/p if every p-fold Massey product

, . . . , , 

p-1 times

vanishes whenever    = 0 (cf. [17, Def. 5.1.1]).

 If K is a field containing a primitive p-th root of 1 (and also -1 if p = 2), then

the maximal pro-p Galois group GK(p) has the triple Massey vanishing property, as

proved by I. Efrat and E. Matzri, and independently by J. Minac and N.D. T^an (cf.

[11, 23]). Moreover, from R. Sharifi's result [37, Thm. 4.3] one knows that GK(p) has

also the p-cyclic Massey vanishing property (cf. [17, § 5.1]), and it was recently proved

by Y.H.J. Lam et al. that the p-cyclic Massey vanishing property implies the triple

Massey vanishing property (cf. [17, Thm. 5.2.1]). In [24, § 7], Minac and T^an produced

some examples of pro-p groups with defined and non-vanishing 3-fold Massey products,

and hence which do not occur as maximal pro-p Galois groups of fields containing a

primitive p-th root of 1.

One has the following interpretation of Massey products in the Z/p-cohomology of a

pro-p groups in terms of unipotent upper-triangular representations (cf., e.g., [22, § 7]).

For n  2 let

  Z/p  GLn+1(Z/p)


be the group of unipotent upper-triangular (n + 1) × (n + 1)-matrices over Z/p. Then Un+1 is a p-group. Moreover, let In+1, Eh,k  Un+1 denote respectively the identity (n + 1) × (n + 1)-matrix and the (n + 1) × (n + 1)-matrix with 1 at entry (h, k) and 0 elsewhere, for 1  h < k  n + 1.
Let G be a pro-p group. If  : G  Un+1 is a representation and 1  h  n, let h,h+1 denote the restriction on the (h, h + 1)-entry of . Then h,h+1 : G  Z/p is a homomorphism, i.e., h,h+1  H1(G, Z/p). One has the following result (cf., e.g., [22, Thm. 7.2] and [24, Lemma 3.7].

Lemma 7.4. Let G be a pro-p group with minimal presentation G = F/R, and let 1, . . . , n be elements of H1(G, Z/p). The n-fold Massey product 1, . . . , n is defined if, and only if, there exists a representation  : F  Un+1 such that h,h+1 = h for h = 1, . . . , n, and such that
Im(|R)  In+1 + E1,n+1Z/p := { In+1 + aE1,n+a | a  Z/p }  Un+1.
Moreover, if   (R/Rp[R, F ]) is the homomorphism defined by
(7.6) (r¯) = a, where r¯ = rRp[R, F ]  R/Rp[R, F ], (r) = In+1 + aE1,n+1,

then trg()  1, . . . , n . In particular, if |R is trivial, then 0  1, . . . , n .
Now we are ready to prove that the pro-p groups defined in Theorem 1.4 have both properties defined in Definition 7.3.

Proposition 7.5. Let G be a pro-p group as in Theorem 1.4. Then G has the p-cyclic Massey vanishing property with repsect to Z/p, and thus also the triple Massey vanishing property.

Proof. Pick ,   H1(G, Z/p), ,  = 0, such that    = 0, and write

d1

d2

 = a + bii + cjj,

with a, bi, cj  Z/p,

(7.7)

i=0

j=0

d1

d2

 = a + bii + cj j ,

i=0

j=0

with a, bi, cj  Z/p,

Set s0 = ab0 - ab0 and s0 = ac0 - ac0, and si = bibi+1 - bibi+1, sj = cjcj+1 - cjcj+1 for every odd i and j. Then by (7.3) one has

0 =    = (s0 + s1 + . . . + sd1-1) ·   0 + (s0 + s1 + . . . + sd2-1) ·   0,

and thus s0 + s1 + . . . + sd1-1 = s0 + s1 + . . . + sd2-1 = 0. Let G = F/R be the minimal presentation of G associated to (1.4). For every

0  i  d1 and 0  j  d2, put A = Ip+1 + a(E1,2 + . . . + Ep-1,n) + aEp,p+1  Up+1,

Bi = Ip+1 + bi(E1,2 + . . . + Ep-1,n) + biEp,p+1  Up+1, Cj = Ip+1 + cj (E1,2 + . . . + Ep-1,n) + cj Ep,p+1  Up+1.

Then one computes

B0p = Ip+1 + bE1,p+1,

p-1

[B0, A] = Ip+1 + s0 · fh(a, b0)Eh,p+1,

h=1

p-1

[Bi, Bi+1] = Ip+1 + si · fh(bi, bi+1)Eh,p+1,

for i odd,

h=1

where b  Z/p and the fh(X, Y )'s are symmetric polynomials in X, Y with coefficients in Z/p of degree deg(fh) = p - 1 - h. Hence,

p-1
B0p[B0, A][B1, B2] · · · [Bd1-1, Bd1 ] = Ip+1 + bE1,p+1 + 0 · Eh,p+1,
h=1
as s0 + . . . + sd1-1 = 0 -- and analogously, putting Cj instead of Bi, and sj instead of si. Therefore, the assignment x-1  A, yi  Bi and zj  Cj for every i, j, defines a
representation  : F  Up+1 such that Im(|R)  Ip+1 + E1,p+1Z/p. Hence, the p-fold Massey product , . . . , ,  is defined by Lemma 7.4.

If one of the following three cases holds:

(a) a = 0 or a = 0; or (b) bi = 0 for some i and cj = 0 for some j; or

1-CYCLOTOMIC ORIENTED PRO-p GROUPS

23

(c) cj = 0 for some j and bi = 0 for some i; then by (7.3) and by Lemma 7.2 the p-fold Massey product , . . . , ,  contains the whole group H2(G, Z/p), and thus it contains 0.
Otherwise, if a = a = 0 and cj = 0 for every 0  j  d2, then (r2) = Ip+1, while (r1) = Ip+1 + bE1,p+1. Thus, for   (R/Rp[R, F ]) as in (7.6), one has
trg() = b ·   0  , . . . , , 
by Lemma 7.4. Since bi = 0 for some i (otherwise  = 0), by (7.3) one has -trg() =    for some   H1(G, Z/p), and therefore 0  , . . . , ,  by Lemma 7.2. The same argument shows that 0  , . . . , ,  also if a = a = 0 and bi = 0 for every 0  i  d2.
Finally, G has also the triple Massey vanishing property by [17, Thm. 5.2.1].

We conclude by asking whether the following pro-p groups can complete into 1cyclotomic oriented pro-p groups -- we believe they can't. In case of negative answer they would provide further new concrete examples of pro-p groups which do not occur as absolute Galois groups.

Question 7.6. Let G be a pro-p group with presentation

(7.8)

G = x, y0, . . . , yd1 , z0, . . . , z0, . . . , zd2 | r1 = r2 = 1 ,

where d1, d2 are even non-negative integers such that d1 + d2  2, and

(7.9)

r1 = [x, y0][y1, y2] · · · [yd1-1, yd1 ],

r2 = [x, z0][z1, z2] · · · [zd2-1, zd2 ].

Can G complete into a 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-p group G = (G, )?

Observe that by the proof of Lemma 6.5, an oriented pro-p group G = (G, ), with G as in Question 7.6, is cohomologically Kummerian if, and only if,  is constantly equal to 1. Moreover, the arguments of the proofs of Proposition 7.1 and Proposition 7.5 show that also the Z/p-cohomology of G is quadratic and it has the p-cyclic Massey vanishing property.
