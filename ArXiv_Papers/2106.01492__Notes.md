## Abstract

In this paper, we introduce a new policy, Nudge, which is the first policy to provably stochastically improve upon FCFS. We prove that Nudge simultaneously improves upon FCFS at every point along the tail, for light-tailed job size distributions. As a result, Nudge outperforms FCFS for every moment and every percentile of response time. Moreover, Nudge provides a multiplicative improvement over FCFS in the asymptotic tail. This resolves a long-standing open problem by showing that, counter to previous conjecture, FCFS is not strongly asymptotically optimal.
