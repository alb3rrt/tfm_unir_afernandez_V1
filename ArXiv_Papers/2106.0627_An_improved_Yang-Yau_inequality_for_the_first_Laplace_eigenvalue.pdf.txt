AN IMPROVED YANG-YAU INEQUALITY FOR THE FIRST LAPLACE EIGENVALUE
MIKHAIL KARPUKHIN AND DENIS VINOKUROV
Abstract. The famous Yang-Yau inequality provides an upper bound for the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on an orientable Riemannian surface solely in terms of its genus  and the area. Its proof relies on the existence of holomorhic maps to CP1 of low degree. Very recently, A. Ros was able to use certain holomorphic maps to CP2 in order to give a quantitative improvement of the Yang-Yau inequality for  = 3. In the present paper, we generalize Ros' argument to make use of holomorphic maps to CPn for any n > 0. As an application, we obtain a quantitative improvement of the Yang-Yau inequality for all genera  > 3 except for  = 4, 6, 8, 10, 14.
1. Introduction
1.1. Yang-Yau inequality. Let (, g) be a closed orientable Riemannian surface. The Laplace-Beltrami operator, or Laplacian, is defined as g = gd, where g is the formal adjoint of the differential d. For closed manifolds, the spectrum of g consists only of eigenvalues and forms the following sequence
0 = 0(, g) < 1(, g) 2(, g) . . .  ,
where eigenvalues are written with multiplicities. Consider the normalized eigenvalues
¯k(, g) = k(, g)Area(, g).
The problem of geometric optimization of eigenvalues consists in determining the exact values of the following quantities
k() = sup ¯k(, g).
g
We refer to [KNPP, K3] and references therein for a detailed survey of recent developments on the problem.
In the present paper we focus on the case k = 1. The first general upper bound on 1() was obtained by Yang and Yau in [YY] who proved that if  has genus , then
1() 8( + 1)

However, it was soon remarked in [ESI] that the same proof yields the following improved bound

(1.1)

1()

,

where x is the floor function or the integer part of x. In the following

we refer to (1.1) as the Yang-Yau inequality. Since the original paper [YY],

alternative proofs of (1.1) have appeared in [BLY, LY].

According to the results of Hersch [H] and Nayatani-Shoda [NS] (see

also [JLNNP]), the Yang-Yau inequality is sharp for  = 0 and  = 2 respectively. Apart from that, the exact value of 1(T2) was computed by
Nadirashvili in [N1],

1(T2)

=

82 . 3

At the same time, it is known that for  = 0, 2 the Yang-Yau inequality is

strict, see [K2]. The existence of metrics achieving 1() has been recently established in [MS].

Remark 1.1. The problem of determining 1() makes sense for nonorientable , see [K1] for a generalization of (1.1) to this setting. We refer
to [LY] and [EGJ, JNP, CKM] for the exact values of 1 on the projective plane and Klein bottle respectively. The existence result of [MS] continues
to hold for non-orientable surfaces.

Finally, in a recent paper [R1] Ros obtained a quantitative improvement

of (1.1) for  = 3. Namely, he proved that if  is an orientable surface of

genus 3, then

 1() 16(4 - 7)  21.668 < 24,

where 24 is the bound given by the Yang-Yau inequality. The results of the present paper are heavily inspired by the work of Ros and are essentially a generalization of [R1] to higher genera.

1.2. Main results. Our main result can be stated as follows.

Theorem 1.2. Let  be a compact orientable surface of genus . Then

one has

(1.2) 1( )

,

where · is the ceiling function. In particular,

1() < 8(0.43 + 2.86).

We show in Lemma 3.6 that the bound (1.2) is an improvement over the Yang-Yau inequality (1.1) as soon as  25. Furthermore, it is easy to compute the asymptotic behaviour of the r.h.s in (1.2). We formulate the corresponding result as follows.

Corollary 1.3. Let  be a compact orientable surface of genus . Then one has

At

the

same

time,

the

Yang-Yau

inequality

only

yields

1 2

in

the

r.h.s

of (1.3).

Finally, we remark that the bound (1.2) is a particular member of a family

of inequalities proved in Proposition 3.1. We choose to state Theorem 1.2

in its present form due to the fact that (1.2) is the best bound in the family

for  102 and, thus, yields the best constant in (1.3). However, for small

, other members of the family yield a better bound. In particular, this

approach gives a quantitative improvement over the Yang-Yau inequality

for all  except for  = 4, 6, 8, 10, 14. We refer to Section 3 and Table 1 for

more details.

1.3. Sketch of the proof. The proof is based on a particular construction
of a balanced map from the surface  to the Euclidean sphere. Such maps are commonly used in the geometric optimization of eigenvalues, we refer
e.g. to [BLY, H, KS, LY, N2] for applications to various problems. The
coordinates of balanced maps are good test-functions for 1 provided the energy of the map is controlled. For example, in [BLY] the authors consider a particular minimal isometric embedding A : CPn  S(n+1)2-2. Precomposing A with a full holomorphic map f :   CPn gives the map Af = Af to a sphere, whose energy is controlled by the degree of f . Finally, they use linear transformations on CPn to arrange Af to be balanced. Among other things, this construction can be used to prove (1.1). In [R1] Ros builds up on this construction by considering a perturbation a = Af + aHf , where Hf is the mean curvature vector of Af and a  R is a parameter. He then takes f :   CP2 to be the quartic realization of any non-hyperelliptic genus 3 surface  and argues that for certain range of a the map a can still be arranged to be balanced. Finally, it turns out that the parameter a can
be chosen so that the energy E(a) < E(0), thus, yielding an improvement over (1.1).
We generalize the argument of Ros by considering f to be a full holo-
morphic map induced by an arbitrary linear system of dimension n. The
Brill-Noether theory provides an existence of such linear systems with degree
bounded in terms of the genus of . This allows to extend Ros' approach to
surfaces of arbitrary genus. An additional upside is that one is free to choose
n. In fact, n = 5 turns out to be optimal for large  and corresponds to
the bound (1.2). A novel feature compared to [R1] is that our maps f could
have branch points. We show that the contribution of the branch points to
the energy E(a) has a negative sign and, thus, could be discarded in the proof of an upper bound.

4

M. KARPUKHIN AND D. VINOKUROV

In conclusion, let us provide some geometric intuition for the definition of a. Since the goal is to minimize the energy of a balanced map, it is natural to deform the map in the direction of the negative gradient of the energy. Since Af is a conformal map, this gradient coincides with the mean curvature vector. Thus, the correspondence Af  a can be seen as one step of the discrete harmonic map heat flow or, equivalently, mean curvature flow. The surprising part of the calculation in [R1] is that the energy of a only depends on a, genus  and the degree of f . It would be interesting to see if this method can be refined further by considering two steps of the discrete flow or a continuous flow.

Organization of the paper. In section 2 we prove a general upper bound for the first eigenvalue in terms of a holomorphic map to CPn, see Theorem 2.7. The content of this section is to the large extent a direct generalization of the results in [R1]. Section 3 is devoted to investigating the bound obtained in Theorem 2.7. Namely, we show that taking n = 5 yields the best bound for large  and show that in this case the bound reduces to (1.2). Table 1 contains the optimal values of n for small . The section is elementary, but computationally heavy.

2. Eigenvalue bounds from holomorphic maps to CPn

In the following (, g) denotes an orientable Riemannian surface of genus

. The metric g (together with a choice of an orientation) induces a complex structure  and thus, we view  as a Riemann surface, throughout

this section. The complex structure only depends on the conformal class [g] = {e2g,   C(M )}. Furthermore, our first result, Theorem 2.7 gives

a bound on

1(, [g]) := sup ¯1(, g).
h[g]

The study of 1(, [g]) is of independent interest due to its connection with the theory of harmonic maps, see e.g. [KNPP].

2.1. Branched holomorphic curves in complex projective spaces. Let f :   CPn be a holomorphic map. One can define the order of the differential at a point p denoted by ordp df as the order of the vector function fz , where df = fz dz in some local coordinates on  and CPn . The total ramification of f is defined as
 = ordp df.
p
If it happens to be nonzero, the metric h = f gF S induced by the FubiniStudy metric has conical singularities, i.e. in a local coordinate z centered at

AN IMPROVED YANG-YAU INEQUALITY

p the metric is given by h = |z|2k 2dzdz¯, where (0) = 0, k = ordp fz . Here we assume that gF S is normalized to have holomorphic sectional curvature
1. Denote its Gauss curvature by K and the volume form by dvh. After
some calculations, we have

(2.1)

Kdvh = 4zz¯ log(|z|k )dx  dy = 4zz¯ log  dx  dy,

which means the Gauss curvature is integrable. Hence, the following formula holds, see e.g. [ET, F],

(2.2)

1 2

Kdvh = 2 - 2g + .


The degree of the map f :   CPn is defined as the positive integer

d that corresponds to the integral homology class f[]  H2(CPn)  Z.

Let F S be the Ka¨hler 2-form associated with Fubiny-Study metric. Then

f41(FFSSr)e=predsvehn,tws ethceocnacnluodneictahl abtasis in integral cohomology H2(CPn). Since

(2.3)

Area(, h) = 4d.

We are interested in finding full holomorphic maps of relatively small degree. Recall that f :   CPn is called full if its image is not contained in a hyperplane CPn-1  CPn. For this purpose, we use Brill­Noether
theory, see e.g. section Special Linear Systems IV in [GH], which assures the existence of a linear system of degree d and dimension n as long as  (n + 1)( + n - d). Removing the base points if necessary, we obtain a full holomorphic map f :   CPn of degree d d. This implies the
following lemma.

Lemma 2.1. For any positive n there exists a full holomorphic map f :   CPn of degree d such that

d

+ n.

2.2. An embedding of CPn into the Euclidean space. Denote by HM1(m) the space of Hermitian operators of trace 1 acting on Cm and
consider the Euclidean metric

A, B = 2 tr AB A, B  HM1(n +1) .

Then CPn can be considered as the space of all orthogonal projectors

of rank 1 in HM1(n +1) . Using the matrix notation, this embedding A : CPn  HM1(n + 1) is given by the formula

z



1 zz

zz

,

where z is a column of homogeneous coordinates and z = z¯t. This embed-

ding is also U (n+1)-equivariant, i.e. it intertwines the actions

(P, z)  P z, (P, A)  P AP 

on CPn and HM1(n + 1) respectively.

6

M. KARPUKHIN AND D. VINOKUROV

The map A has been studied in detail in [R2]. The following properties

are of particular importance to us.

(1) The map A is an isometry. Recall that CPn is endowed with the

Fubini-Study metric of holomorphic sectional curvature 1. (2) The image of CPn is a minimal submanifold of the sphere S(n+1)2-2

in

HM1(n +1)

centered

at

1 n+1

I

with

radius

2n n+1

,

where

I

is

the

identity matrix.

Now let f :   CPn be a holomorphic curve. The composition of the

previous embedding with f produces the map Af :   HM1(n +1) . The map Af is an immersion on the complement ° to the set of the branched points of f. Thus, on this open set °, one can apply all the local formulae from differential geometry by considering ° as an immersed Riemannian

manifold with the induced metric h, also denoted by ·, · .
Let  be the second fundamental form of the immersion f : °  CPn . Since CPn with the Fubini­Study metric is a Ka¨hler manifold, its Levi-

Civita connection commutes with the complex structure, i.e. J = J. As

a consequence, we have

(2.4)

(JX, Y ) = (X, JY ) = J(X, Y ).

An isometric immersion of a Riemannian manifold M into another one M yields the relation between their sectional curvatures given as follows,

K(, ) = K(, ) +

(, ), (, ) ||2||2 -

- ,

|( 2

,

)|2

,

where ,   TpM are linearly independent. Take M = °, M = CPn and  = J so that {, } form an orthonormal basis of TpM . Then one obtains that K(, ) = K is just the Gaussian curvature of ° and K(, ) = 1 is the holomorphic sectional curvature of CPn with the Fubini­Study metric.
Applying (2.4), one sees that (, ) = -(, ) and (, ) = J(, ). This
immediately implies

(2.5)

K

-

||2h.

Since HM1(n +1) is an affine space, the coordinate-wise Hessian of Af coincides with its second fundamental form. In particular, we have

(2.6)

- Af = tr Hess Af = 2Hf ,

where H stands for mean curvature of the map Af : °  HM1(n +1) .

Lemma 2.2. The following relations hold:

|I|2 = 2(n + 1),    Hf , I = 0,

Proof. The first row follows from the definition of the isometric embedding CPn  HM1(n +1) . The next equation is obtained by noticing that the tan-
gent space of HM1(n +1) consists of all Hermitian operators B with tr B = 0.
The rest follows from Lemma 3.2 in [R3].

From formulae (2.2), (2.3), and (2.5) one has,

In particular, the energy remains invariant under projective transforma-

For the second, we claim that

(2.8)

|da|2h dvh = ha, a dvh.





Indeed, for a branch point pi define B(pi, ) to be the set {|z| }, where z is holomorphic coordinate centered at pi. Then we denote by  the complement to the union of all such sets. Green's first identity implies that

(2.9)

|da|2h dvh -

ha, a dvh =

da(h), a dsh,







8

M. KARPUKHIN AND D. VINOKUROV

where dsh is the length element of  = iB(pi, ) and h its outer unit normal. Also, one sees from the first part of the proof that

(2.10)

| da(h), a | |da(h)| |a| C |da(h)| .

The proof of Lemma 3.1 in [R3] (third formula on p. 438) implies that |da(h)| C (||h + 1) . Meanwhile, formulae (2.5) and (2.1) yield the estimate ||h + 1 C-k, in a neighborhood of a branch point of the order k. On the other hand, by parametrizing B(pi, ) as z = eit, we see that dsh = O k+1 dt. Consequently, the r.h.s. in (2.9) is O() as   0. Using this fact, we have

|da|2h dvh = ha, a dvh = 2ahHf - 2Hf , Af + 2aHf dvh =







= 2(1 - 2a)2 + 2a2 ||2h dvh.


An application of formulae (2.7) completes the proof of the identities.
Let us present an alternative proof of (2.8). Let  be a logarithmic cut-off function around the branch points, i.e. 0  1 such that d L2(h)  0,   1 outside of a small neighbourhood of branch points and  are nonincreasing in  (see e.g. [KNPP, Section 3.4]). Note that d L2(h) only depends on the conformal class [h], therefore, such a function can be easily
constructed using the local holomorphic coordinates. Since a is smooth and supported away from the branch points, an application of the Green's
identity yields

|d(a)|2h dvh = h(a), a dvh.





At the same time, using that |a| is a constant, one has

|d(a)|2h dvh =




|d|2h|a|2

d||2, d|a|2

Finally, to show that a  W 1,2(, g), it is sufficient to observe that the Dirichlet integral is conformally invariant and that a is a bounded function.

2.3. The center of mass. Let us denote by H the convex hull of CPn  HM1(n +1) . Recalling the fact that CPn is embedded into HM1(n +1) as a set of all one-dimensional orthogonal projectors and the fact that Her-
mitian operators are diagonalizable, one has:

· H = {A  HM1(n +1) | A 0} , where A tive semi-definite;
· int H = {A  HM1(n +1) | A > 0} ; · H = {A  H | rk A n}.

0 means that A is posi-

Using these facts, we can prove the following lemma.

Any point P  int H  HM1(n +1) defines a projective transformation of CPn. If the map Af :   HM1(n +1) corresponds to the holomorphic map f :   CPn, then we denote by AfP the map corresponding to fP = P  f. Let HfP be its mean curvature vector.
Given a metric g on  we define the map a : int H  HM1(n +1) by the

formula

a(P )

=

1 Area (,

g)

(AfP + 2aHfP ) dvg.


To each transformation P the map a assigns the center of mass of

AfP + 2aHfP with respect to the metric g. Our goal is to show that there

exists

P0

such

that

a(P0)

=

We consider a as a parameter. Lemma 2.3 implies that AfP + 2aHfP is

bounded provided a bounded. It follows from the dominated convergence

theorem that the map  depends continuously on a and P. The case a = 0

is studied in [BLY] and it turns out that the map 0 possesses the following

properties,

The following theorem is a direct generalization of the bound of Ros in [R1].

Theorem 2.7. Let (, g) be a compact oriented Riemannian surface of

genus  endowed with the compatible complex structure. Suppose that

there exists a full holomorphic map f :   CPn with total ramification

is constant and the energy of a does not

2n(n+1)

follows from the continuity of G(a).

3. The proof of the main theorem

To effectively apply inequality (2.12) one needs to find full holomorphic maps f :   CPn of low degree. Such maps are given by Lemma 2.1. Note
that the r.h.s of (2.12) is increasing in deg(f ) and decreasing in , therefore
one has the following proposition.

Proposition 3.1. Let  be an orientable surface of genus . Then for any n  Z, n > 0 and any |a|  1 one has

The remainder of this section is devoted to choosing the values (a, n) that lead to the best bound for each fixed . One first observes that for n = 1 the minimum of F (a, 1, ) is achieved for a = 0 and the resulting bound is the Yang-Yau bound (1.1). In the following we assume n 2.

The

Therefore, the first assertion follows from the formula for the roots of a

Recall that we are assuming n 2; therefore, one has

can

be

as

-

Provided n (3.1)

n(n - 1) n(n + 1) - 2



< .

n 2n - n + 1

Note that for any

holds.

Thus,

for

obtains

Similarly, for all

For

a

fixed

the

r.h.s is an increasing function of ; therefore, as long as

the

condition

is

satisfied

for

calculation shows that (3.3) holds for (n, 0) = (2, 1), (3, 4), (4, 34).

Remark 3.4. By a direct computation using (3.1) one can see that, in fact,

amin

<

2n(n+1)

for

n

=

3 and n = 4, 

30. This observation is not

necessary for the following arguments, since the low genus case is treated

separately in Table 1.

Having determined the optimal value of a, we define



F  1 , n,  ,

 

2n(n+1)





Fn() = F (amin(n, ), n, ),

if n 5; if n = 2,  1; n = 3,  4;

 

n = 4,  34;



 F (0, 1, ) = 8

if n = 1,

where F1() is the r.h.s in the Yang-Yau inequality (1.1). A direct computation yields that

where a 0.4271, b 2.8501. The following lemma states that taking n 6 is never optimal.

Lemma 3.5. For any  0 and any n > 5 one has

Fn() > F5().

one has that for n > 5

To complete the proof we estimate an, bn separately to show that an > a and bn > b for n 6, where a, b are as in (3.5).

Table 1. Optimal values of n for low genera. The value n = 1 corresponds to the Yang-Yau unequality, i.e. for  = 4, 6, 8, 10, 14 our results do not improve on (1.1). To obtain the upper bound, one needs to apply Proposition 3.1 for the corresponding values of n and .

One has (3.6)

The r.h.s of (3.7) is increasing in n. As a result, it is straightforward to
compute that (3.7) implies an > a for n 13. For 5 < n < 13, one proves an > a by a direct computation using (3.6).

where in the last inequality we used n 6. As a result, (3.9) implies bn > b for n 11. For 5 < n < 11, one proves bn > b by a direct computation using (3.8).

Finally, we investigate the range 1 n 5.
Lemma 3.6. One has the following: (1) If  25, then F1() > F5();

15

(2) If  (3) If  (4) If 

50, then F2() > F5(); 120, then F3() > F5(); 410, then F4() > F5().

Proof. Let us first deal with n = 1. One obtains F1() 4( + 2) and

a direct comparison with (3.5) gives F1() > F5() for  26. The case

 = 25 can be checked directly.

If

then
