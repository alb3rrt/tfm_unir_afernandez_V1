## Abstract

We study the algebraic and arithmetic structure of monoids of invertible ideals (more precisely, of $r$-invertible $r$-ideals for certain ideal systems $r$) of Krull and weakly Krull Mori domains. We also investigate monoids of all nonzero ideals of polynomial rings with at least two indeterminates over noetherian domains. Among others, we show that they are not transfer Krull but they share several arithmetical phenomena with Krull monoids having infinite class group and prime divisors in all classes.
