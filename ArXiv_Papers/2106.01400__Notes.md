## Abstract

Inspired by results in text-to-speech synthesis, in this work, we use an in-house rule-based phoneme-level common label set (CLS) representation to train multilingual and code-switching ASR for Indian languages. We propose two end-to-end (E2E) ASR systems. In the first system, the E2E model is trained on the CLS representation, and we use a novel data-driven back-end to recover the native language script. In the second system, we propose a modification to the E2E model, wherein the CLS representation and the native language characters are used simultaneously for training. We show our results on the multilingual and code-switching tasks of the Indic ASR Challenge 2021. Our best results achieve 6% and 5% improvement (approx) in word error rate over the baseline system for the multilingual and code-switching tasks, respectively, on the challenge development data.
