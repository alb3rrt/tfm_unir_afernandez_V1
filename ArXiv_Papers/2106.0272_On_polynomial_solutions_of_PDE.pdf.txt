1 Introduction

Let us start with the bivariate case. Denote by n the space of biariate polynomials of total degree at most n :

n = {

aijxiyj}, dim n = 1/2(n + 1)(n + 2).

i+jn

Thus 0 = {c : c = const.}, dim 0 = 1 and -1 = {0}, dim -1 = 0. We set  = n0n.

Denote also by n the space homogeneous polynomials of total degree

n:

n = {

aijxiyj }, dim n = n + 1.

i+j=n

For a polynomial p denote by p(D) the respective differentiation opera-

tor:

p(D)

=

p(

 x

,

 y

).

Definition 1.1. Suppose that p  n, p(x, y) = i+jn aijxiyj. Then the kth homogeneous layer of p we denote by

p(k) =

aij xiyj.

i+j=k

Denote also by p the upper nonzero homogeneous layer of p and by p the lower nonzero homogeneous layer of p.

Definition 1.2. The point O = (0, 0) is called an m-fold zero for p if the lower homogeneous layer of p(x) is the mth one. A point a  C2 is called an m-fold zero for p if the lower homogeneous layer of p(x + a) is the mth one.
Let V and W be finite dimensional linear spaces and L be a linear operator L : V  W. In the sequel we will use the following formula

dim(ImL) = dim V - dim(kerL).

(1.1)

Let us bring the following result:

Theorem 1.3 ( Th. 5, [1]; Th. 6, [2]). Assume that a polynomial f0 is a solution of the PDE p(D)f = 0. Then the partial derivatives of f0 are solutions too.
Corollary 1.4. Suppose that p(x, y) = i+jn aijxiyj: The homogeneous PDE p(D)f = 0 has nonzero polynomial solution if and only if f = 1 is its solution, i.e., p(D)1 = a00 = 0:
In the sequel we will use the following
Theorem 1.5 (Th. 2.1, [3]). Suppose that the origin O = (0, 0) is an s-fold zero of p  n. Then the homogeneous PDE p(D)f = 0 has exactly Dk linearly independent solutions in k, where Dk is the kth partial sum of the following number series

di = 1 + 2 + · · · + s + · · · + s + · · · .
i=0
Note that in the case s = 0, i.e., p(0, 0) = 0, this result states that the PDE p(D)f = 0 has no solution except f = 0. Of course this statement coincides with Corollary 1.4.

2 Main result
We are going to prove the following Theorem 2.1. Assume that q  m and the origin O = (0, 0) is an s-fold zero of p  . Then we have that the PDE
p(D)f = q has a polynomial solution from m+s.
In view of Theorem 1.5 we get

2

Corollary 2.2. Assume that the origin O = (0, 0) is an s-fold zero of p   and q  m. Then we have that the solutions of PDE

p(D)f = q,

(2.1)

belonging to k, k  m + s, form an affine space of dimension



=

s(2k

.

Thus the solutions of PDE (2.1) can be represented as


f = f0 + ifi,
i=1

where f0  m+s is a solution of PDE (2.1) and fi, i = 1, ..., , are the linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous PDE p(D)f = 0 in k.
Let us start the consideration with the case when both p and q are homogeneous. Note that the following is a particular case s = n of Theorem 3.1.

Proposition 2.3. Assume that p  n and q  m. Then the PDE p(D)f = q has a solution from n+m.

Proof. Let us verify that in this case the number of linearly independent solutions of PDE p(D)f = 0 in n+m is n. Indeed, according to Theorem 1.5, the number of linearly independent solutions of PDE p(D)f = 0 in n+m is:
1 + 2 + ... + n + mn,

while in n+m-1 is:

1 + 2 + ... + n + (m - 1)n :

Then consider the linear operator L : n+m  m, given by Lf = p(D)f. What we verified above means that dim(kerL) = n. Now, by using the formula (1.1), we get

dim(ImL) = dimn+m - dim(kerL) = m + n + 1 - n = m + 1 = dimm.

Therefore the operator L is on n+m and the equation (2.1) has a solution.

Second proof of Proposition 2.3. By using Theorem 1.5, we proved Proposition 2.3, which states the polynomial solability of the PDE p(D)f = q in the case when p and q are homogeneous polynomials. Now, let us establish the same result in other way, which will be important in the proof of the result in the case of polynomials of more variables.

Assume that p  n and q  m : p(x, y) = a0xn + a1xn-1y + ... + anyn, q(x, y) = b0xm + b1xm-1y + ... + bmym.
Let us find a solution f  n+m of the PDE

p(D)f = q.

(2.2)

Suppose that f (x, y) = 0xn+m + 1xn+m-1y + · · · + n+myn+m.

Now, the PDE (3.2) looks like

(a0xn + a1xn-1y + ... + anyn)(D)(0xn+m + 1xn+m-1y + ... + n+myn+m)

= b0xm + b1xm-1y + ... + bmym
By equating the coefficients of xm, xm-1y, . . . , ym in the left and right hand sides of the equation we get

respectively.

If a0 = 0, then m+1, m+2, ..., m+n, are n free variables in above linear system. Thus the solutions of system form an affine space of dimension n.
If a0 = 0 and a1 = 0, then it is easily seen that 0 becomes a free variable instead of m+1 and again we have n free variables.
In the general case, when a0 = a1 = · · · ak-1 = 0 and ak = 0, the n free variables are 0, . . . , k-1 and m+k+1, . . . , m+n.

Thus in the above considered case, when p  n and q  m, we get another proof of the fact that the solutions of the PDE (3.2) form an affine space of dimension n.
Now consider a particular case s = 0 of Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 2.2:

Proposition 2.4. Suppose that p  n, q  m and the free term of p is not zero: a00 = 0. Then we have that the PDE

p(D)f = q

(2.3)

has a unique solution f0  m. The polynomial f0 is the only solution of the PDE (2.3) also in each k, k  m.

4

Proof. Since p(D)1 = a00 = 0, we get from Corollary 1.4, that the PDE p(D)f = 0 has a unique polynomial solution f = 0:
Then consider the linear operator L : m  m given by Lf = p(D)f. Above we verified that kerL = {0}: Now, by using the formula (1.1), we get that
dim(ImL) = dimm - dim(kerL) = dimm.
Thus the equation (2.3) has a unique solution in m denoted by f1. Now, concerning the other polynomial spaces, assume by way of contra-
diction, that the equation (2.3) has another solution, denoted by f2, f2 = f1, in k, where k > m. Then we get that f1 - f2 is a nonzero polynomial solution of the PDE p(D)f = 0, which contradicts Corollary 1.4.

Now we are in a position to present
Proof of Theorem 3.1. Let us use induction on m. As the first step of induction consider the case m = -1, q  -1, i.e., q = 0 (the next step is m = 0, q  0, i.e., q = const. = 0). In this case the PDE p(D)f = 0 has a polynomial solution 0  m+s, s  0.
Now assume that the PDE

p(D)f = q

(2.4)

has a solution if q  m+s-1. Let us prove that it has a solution assuming that q  m+s. Now assume that the lower homogeneous layer of p is the sth layer: p = p(s).
Next assume that f  m+s and f  = f(m+s) is the upper homogeneous layer of f. Note that the case f(m+s) = 0 follows from the induction hypothesis.
Consider the following PDE with homogeneous polynomials p(s) and q(m) :
p(s)(D)f = q(m).
According to Theorem 2.3 this equation has a solution f^  m+s :

p(s)(D)f^ = q(m).

(2.5)

Next let us seek for a solution of the PDE (2.4) in the form f = g + f^ :

p(D)(g + f^) = q.

(2.6)

It is easily seen that, in view of (2.5), this PDE is equivalent to

where r = q - p(D)(f^).

p(D)(g) = r,

(2.7)

5

Note that p = p(s) readily implies that p(D)(f^)  m. Since also r  m we obtain that r  m too.
Next let us verify that r  m-1. It is enough to show that r(m) = 0. To this purpose, by using (2.5), we obtain that
r(m) = q(m) - [p(D)(f^)](m) = q(m) - p(s)(D)(f^) = q(m) - q(m) = 0. Now, in view of r  m-1, let us use the induction hypothesis. Hence, we get that the PDE (2.7) has a solution denoted by g0, where g0  m+s-1. Therefore f = g0 + f^ is a solution of the PDE (2.4). Note also that this implies that f^ = fm+s.

3 The case of more than two variables

Let us use stamdard multivariate notation. For x = (x1, . . . , xk)  Ck and  = (1, . . . , k  mathbbZ+k denote

x = x1 1 · · · xkk , || = 1 + · · · + k, ! = 1! · · · k!.

Denote by (nk) the space polynomials of k variables of total degree at

most n,

n = {

ax},

dim (nk) =

n+k k

.

||n

We set

(k) = n0(nk).

Denote also by (nk) the space homogeneous polynomials of total degree n, for which we have that

n = {

ax},

dim (nk) =

n+k-1 k-1

.

||=n

The following result holds for polynomials of k variables:
Theorem 3.1. Assume that q  (mk) and the origin O = (0, . . . , 0) is an s-fold zero of p  (k). Then we have that the PDE

p(D)f = q

has a polynomial solution from (mk+) s.

It is clear from the previous section that all we need is to generalize Proposition 2.3 to the case of k variables:

Proposition 3.2. Assume that p  (nk) and q  (mk). Then the PDE

p(D)f = q

(3.1)

has a solution from (nk+)m.

6

Proof. Assume that p  n and q  m :

p(x) =

ax,

||=n

q(x) =

bx.

||=m

Let us find a solution f  n+m of the PDE

p(D)f = q.

Suppose that

f (x) =

x.

||=m+n

Now, the PDE (3.2) looks like

(3.2)

ax(D)

x =

bx.

||=n

||=m+n

||=m

By equating the terms with x0, |0|  m, in the left and right hand sides of the equation, we get that

ax(D)+0 x+0 = b0 x0 .
||=n
For the respective coefficients we have that

( + 0)!a+0 = 0!b0 .
||=n

(3.3)

By the change of unknowns  = ! we get the linear system

a +0 = 0!b0 .
||=n

Let us verify that the main matrix of this system has full rank.

Note that in the row of the matrix with 0 = (0, . . . , 0) we have the

coefficients of the polynomial p(x), while in the row with any 0, where |0|  m, we have the coefficients of the polynomial xp(x).

Thus if the rows of the main matrix are linearly dependent then so are the

polynomials xp(x), |0|  m, which evidently takes place only if p(x)  0.

Therefore we have that the linear system (3.3) also is a full rank linear

system, where we have

m+k-1 k-1

equations and

n+m+k-1 k-1

unknowns.

Thus we have that the system is consistent. Moreover, in the solution of

the linear system we have exactly

(n, m, k) :=

n+m+k-1 k-1

-

m+k-1 k-1

free variables.
