## Abstract

Numerical analysis of dark matter axion-like cloud in the vicinity of rotating black hole has been performed. The model where axion-like scalar field is non-trivially coupled to Maxwell field is studied in the spacetime of Kerr black hole in uniform magnetic field and in Kerr-Newman one. The dependence of scalar mass and black hole angular momentum on accumulation of axion dark matter cloud was given. It was revealed that condensation of the dark matter clouds is preferable for a very small mass of axion.
