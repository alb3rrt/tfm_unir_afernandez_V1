TRIEBEL-LIZORKIN SPACES WITH GENERAL WEIGHTS
DOUADI DRIHEM
Abstract. In this paper, the author introduce Triebel-Lizorkin spaces with general smoothness. We present the -transform characterization of these spaces in the sense of Frazier and Jawerth and we prove their Sobolev embeddings. Also, we establish the smooth atomic and molecular decomposition of these function spaces. To do these we need a generalization of some maximal inequality to the case of general weights.

1. Introduction

This paper is a continuation of [14], where the author introduced Besov spaces with general smoothness and presented some their some properties, such as the -transform characterization in the sense of Frazier and Jawerth, the smooth atomic, molecular and wavelet decomposition and the characterization of these function spaces in terms of the difference relations.
The spaces of generalized smoothness are have been introduced by several authors. We refer, for instance, to Bownik [6], Cobos and Fernandez [9], Goldman [28] and [29], and Kalyabin [36]; see also Besov [3] and [4], and Kalyabin and Lizorkin [37].
The theory of these spaces had a remarkable development in part due to its usefulness in applications. For instance, they appear in the study of trace spaces on fractals, see Edmunds and Triebel [18] and [19], were they introduced the spaces Bps,,q, where  is a so-called admissible function, typically of log-type near 0. For a complete treatment of these spaces we refer the reader the work of Moura [42]. More general function spaces of generalized smoothness can be found in Farkas and Leopold [20], and reference therein.
A. Tyulenev has been introduced in [58], [60] and [59] new family of Besov space of variables smoothness which cover many classes of Besov spaces, where the norm on these spaces was defined with the help of classical differences. Based on this weighted class and [14] we introduce Triebel-Lizorkin spaces of variable smoothness, which defined as follows. Select a Schwartz function  such that

where c > 0. Let S (Rn) be the topological dual of S(Rn) and we put v = 2vn(2v·), v  Z. Let 0 < p <  and 0 < q . Let {tk} be a p-admissible sequence i.e. tk  Llpoc(Rn), k  Z. The Triebel-Lizorkin space Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) is the collection of all

with the usual modifications if q = . We have organized the article in 3 sections. First we give some preliminaries and recall
some basic facts on the Muckenhoupt classes and the weighted class of Tyulenev. Also we give some key technical lemmas needed in the proofs of the main statements. Especially, we present new version of weighted vector-valued maximal inequality of Fefferman and Stein. In Section 3 several basic properties such as the -transform characterization are obtained. We extend the well-known Sobolev embeddings to these function spaces and we give the atomic and molecular decomposition of these function spaces.
Other properties of these function spaces such as duality, the case p =  and complex interpolation are given in [15] and [16].

2. Maximal inequalities

Our arguments of this paper essentially relies on the weighted boundedness of HardyLittlewood maximal function. In this paper we will assume that the weight sequence {tk} used to define the space Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) lies in the new weighted class X ,,p (see Definition 2.7). Therefore we need a new version of Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequality. Throughout this paper we make some notation and conventions.

2.1. Notation and conventions. Throughout this paper, we denote by Rn the n-dimensional real Euclidean space, N the collection of all natural numbers and N0 = N{0}. The letter Z stands for the set of all integer numbers. The expression f g means that f c g
for some independent constant c (and non-negative functions f and g), and f  g means
f g f.

By supp f we denote the support of the function f , i.e., the closure of its non-zero set. If E  Rn is a measurable set, then |E| stands for the (Lebesgue) measure of E and E denotes its characteristic function. By c we denote generic positive constants, which may
have different values at different occurrences.

A weight is a nonnegative locally integrable function on Rn that takes values in (0, ) almost everywhere. For measurable set E  Rn and a weight , (E) denotes

^
(x)dx.
E
Given a measurable set E  Rn and 0 < p , we denote by Lp(E) the space of all functions f : E  C equipped with the quasi-norm

f |Lp(E) :=

^

|f (x)|p dx

1/p
< ,

E

with 0 < p <  and

f |L(E) := ess-sup |f (x)| < .
xE

For a function f in Ll1oc(Rn), we set

MA(f )

:=

1 |A|

^
A

|f (x)| dx

WEIGTHED LIZORKIN-TRIEBEL SPACES

for any A  Rn. Furthermore, we put

MA,p(f ) :=

1 |A|

^
A

|f

(x)|p

dx

1
p,

with 0 < p < . Further, given a measurable set E  Rn and a weight , we denote the space of all functions f : Rn  C with finite quasi-norm

f |Lp(Rn, ) = f |Lp(Rn)

by Lp(Rn, ).

If 1

p



and

1 p

+

1 p

=

1,

then

p

is

called

the

conjugate

exponent

of

p.

Let 0 < p, q . The space Lp(q) is defined to be the set of all sequences {fk} of

functions such that

{fk}|Lp(q) :=



1

|fk|q q |Lp(Rn) < 

k=-

with the usual modifications if q = . The symbol S(Rn) is used in place of the set of all Schwartz functions  on Rn, i.e., 
is infinitely differentiable and



SM

:= sup
Nn0 ,||

sup |(x)|(1 + |x|)n+M+||
M xRn

for all M  N. In what follows, Q will denote an cube in the space Rn with sides parallel
to the coordinate axes and l(Q) will denote the side length of the cube Q. For all cubes
Q and r > 0, let rQ be the cube concentric with Q having the side length rl(Q). For v  Z and m  Zn, denote by Qv,m the dyadic cube,

Qv,m := 2-v([0, 1)n + m).

For the collection of all such cubes we use Q := {Qv,m : v  Z, m  Zn}. For each cube Q, we denote by xv,m the lower left-corner 2-vm of Q = Qv,m.

2.2. Muckenhoupt weights. The purpose of this subsection is to review some known properties of Muckenhoupt class.

Definition 2.1. Let 1 < p < . We say that a weight  belongs to the Muckenhoupt

class Ap(Rn) if there exists a constant C > 0 such that for every cube Q the following

inequality holds

MQ

p p

C.

(2.2)

The smallest constant C for which (2.2) holds, denoted by Ap(). As an example, we can take
(x) = |x|,   R.
Then   Ap(Rn), 1 < p < , if and only if -n <  < n(p - 1). For p = 1 we rewrite the above definition in the following way.

Definition 2.3. We say that a weight  belongs to the Muckenhoupt class A1(Rn) if there exists a constant C > 0 such that for every cube Q and for a.e. y  Q the following
inequality holds

MQ() C(y).

(2.4)

4

D. DRIHEM

The smallest constant C for which (2.4) holds, denoted by A1(). The above classes have been first studied by Muckenhoupt [43] and use to characterize the boundedness of
the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function on Lp(), see the monographs [26] and [30] for a complete account on the theory of Muckenhoupt weights.
We recall a few basic properties of the class Ap(Rn) weights, see [17, Chapter 7], [30, Chapter 7] and [52, Chapter 5].

Lemma 2.5. Let 1 p < .

(i) If   Ap(Rn), then for any 1 p < q,   Aq(Rn). (ii) Let 1 < p < .   Ap(Rn) if and only if 1-p  Ap(Rn). (iii) Let   Ap(Rn). There is C > 0 such that for any cube Q and a measurable subset EQ

|E| |Q|

p-1
MQ()

C ME ( ).

(iv) Suppose that   Ap(Rn) for some 1 < p < . Then there exists a 1 < p1 < p <  such that   Ap1(Rn). (v) If   Ap(Rn), then for any 0 <  1,   Ap(Rn).

The following theorem gives a useful property of Ap(Rn) weights (reverse H¨older inequality), see [30, Chapter 7] or [41, Chapter 1].

Theorem 2.6. Let 1 p <  and   Ap(Rn). Then there exist a constants C > 0 and  > 0 depending only on p and the Ap(Rn) constant of , such that for every cube Q,
MQ,1+() CMQ().
2.3. The weight class X ,,p. Let 0 < p . A weight sequence {tk} is called padmissible if tk  Llpoc(Rn) for all k  Z. We mention here that
^ tpk(x)dx < c
E
for any k  Z and any compact set E  Rn, where the constant c is independent of k. For a p-admissible weight sequence {tk} we set
tk,m := tk|Lp(Qk,m) , k  Z, m  Zn.
Tyulenev [57] introduced the following new weighted class and used it to study Besov spaces of variable smoothness.

Definition 2.7. Let 1, 2  R, p, 1, 2  (0, +),  = (1, 2) and let  = (1, 2). We let X ,,p = X ,,p(Rn) denote the set of p-admissible weight sequences {tk} satisfying the following conditions. There exist numbers C1, C2 > 0 such that for any k j and every cube Q,

MQ,p(tk)MQ,1(t-j 1) MQ-,1p(tk)MQ,2(tj )

C121(k-j), C222(j-k).

(2.8) (2.9)

The constants C1, C2 > 0 are independent of both the indexes k and j.

Remark 2.10. (i) We would like to mention that if {tk} satisfying (2.8) with

and (ii)

0<r<p< We say that

where c is independent of k. (iii) Definition 2.7 is different from the one used in [57, Definition 2.1] and Definition 2.7 in [58], because we used the boundedness of the maximal function on weighted Lebesgue spaces.

Remark 2.12. Let 0 <  p < . Let 1, 2  R, 1, 2  (0, +), 2 p,  = (1, 2)

and let  = (1 =

Let a p-admissible weight sequence {tk}  X ,,p.

Then

Further notation will be properly introduced whenever needed.

2.4. Auxiliary results. In this subsection we present some results which are useful for us.

Let recall the vector-valued maximal inequality of Fefferman and Stein [21]. As usual, we

put

M(f )(x)

:=

sup
Q

^

|f (y)|

dy,

f  Ll1oc(Rn),

where the supremum is taken over all cubes with sides parallel to the axis and x  Q.

Also we set

M(f )

:=

(M(

|f

))

0 <  < .

Theorem 2.13. Let 0 < p < , 0 < q  and 0 <  < min(p, q). Then

holds for all sequence of functions {fk}  Lp(q).

We shall require below the following theorem, is the Fefferman and Stein inequality [21].

Lemma 2.15. Let 1 < p < . Given a non-negative real valued functions f and g. We

have

^

(M(f )(x))p g(x)dx c (f (x))p M(g)(x)dx,

Rn

with c independent of f and g.

For the proof see [30, Chapter 7]. We need the following version of the Caldero´nZygmund covering lemma, see [10, Lemma 3.3], [11, Appendix A] and [45, Chapter 7].

Let Ei = hQi,h

6

and Ei,h = Qi,h\(Qi,h  Ei+1). Then Ei,h  Qi,h, there exists a constant  > 1, depending only on a, such |Qi,h| |Ei,h| and the sets Ei,h are pairwise disjoint for all i and h.

Let S denote the linear space of sequences of function {fk} of the form fk is a simple function on Rn and fk = 0 for all sufficiently large |k|. Then S is dense in Lp(q), 1 < p, q < , see [2].
The main aim of the following lemma is to extend an interpolation result for sublinear operators on Lebesgue spaces obtained by Caldero´n and Zygmund in [8] to similar operators acting on Lp(q) spaces.
Consider a mapping function T , which maps measurable functions on Rn into measurable functions on Rn. We say that T is sublinear if it is satisfies
(i) T (f ) is defined (uniquely) if f = f1 + f2, and T (f1) and T (f2) are defined; (ii) For any constant c, T (cf ) is defined if T (f ) is defined and |T (cf )| = |c||T (f )|; (iii)
|T (f1 + f2)| |T (f1)| + |T (f2)|
for every measurable functions f1 and f2.

Lemma 2.17. Let tk, k  Z be locally integrable functions on Rn and 1 < qi < , 1 < pi < , Mi > 0, i = 0, 1. Suppose that T is a sublinear operator satisfying

{tkT (fk)}|Lpi(qi) Mi {tkfk}|Lpi(qi)

for any {tkfk}  Lpi(qi), i = 0, 1. Then T can be extended to a bounded operator:

{tkT (fk)}|Lp(q) M11-M2 {tkfk}|Lp(q)

(2.18)

for any {tkfk}  Lp(q), where

Proof. We will do the proof into two steps. Step 1. We prove that (2.18) holds for any sequence of simple functions {tkfk}  S. Substep 1.1. Preparation. Assume that

{tkfk}|Lp(q) = 1

and we put

^

I :=

tk(x)|T (fk)(x)|gk(x)dx,

k=- Rn

where {gk}  S such that

{gk}|Lp(q) 1.

From our assumption on the sequence of simple functions {tkfk} and {gk}, we clearly

have that

for sufficiently large k, |k| N, N  N. For k fixed, the sets El,k are disjoint. The same property holds for the sets Ej,k. For any z  C we set

The non-negative function  reduces to I for z = . Using the fact that {gk} is a sequence of simple functions we have

Substep 1.2. We prove that  is continuous in the strip 0 (z) 1. First we prove that j,k is well defined. Let us consider the two integrals

(2.19)

Our assumption on T yields that the first term in (2.19) is finite. Iz2,j,k is finite since {gk}  S. Hence (z) exists for each z in the strip 0 (z) 1.
Now we prove the continuity of  in the strip 0 (z) 1. We clearly have that

j,k(z + z) - j,k(z) = J1,j,k(z, z) + J2,j,k(z, z),

(2.20)

where

^

J1,j,k(z, z) :=

(x, (z + z)) - (x, (z)) tk(x) |T (z,j,k)(x)| dx

Ej,k

and

^

J2,j,k(z, z) :=

(x, (z + z))tk(x) |T (z+z,j,k)(x)| - |T (z,j,k)(x)| dx.

Ej,k

We want to find the limit of (2.20) as z approaches 0, so we may assume that |z = (z) + i(z)| 1. After a simple calculation we find that

(x, (z + z)) - (x, (z))

= B((z))-((z))(x) Bh(z)(x) - 1 B((z))-((z))(x) Bh(z)(x) + 1 B((z))-((z))(x) max(1, Bh(x), B-h(x)) + 1 ,

Therefore the function x - (x, (z + z)) - (x, (z)) tk(x) |T (z,j,k)(x)| is integrable. Dominated convergence theorem yields that J1,j,k(z, z) tends to zero as z tends to 0. Now

Dominated convergence theorem yields that J2,j,k(z, z) tends to zero as z tends to 0 and j,k is continuous at z. Hence  is continuous in the strip 0 (z) 1.
Substep 1.3. Here we prove that  is bounded in the strip 0 (z) 1. From Substep 1.2, we need only to prove that Iz2,j,k M , independent of z. We have

Substep 1.4. In this step we prove that log j,k(z) is subharmonic. We fix a harmonic function h(z), and denote by H(z) the analytic function whose real part is h(z). We need only to prove that j,k(z)eh(z) is subharmonic for every harmonic h(z). Since the problem is local, we may consider h and H in a given circle. Put

z,j,k := z,j,keH(z) and j,k(z) := j,k(z)eh(z).

We fix z, take a  > 0, and denote by z1, ..., zr be a system of points equally spaced over the circumference of the circle with center z and radius . Our estimate use partially
some techniques already used in [39]. First we prove that log T (z,j,k) is subharmonic. We want to show that

T (z,j,k) = eh(z) T (z,j,k)

Let us calculate the limit of

In view of the fact that

r

v=1

which is valid since z,j,k is analytic for each x, dominated convergence theorem yields that the last norm tends to zero as r tends to infinity. Therefore (2.23) tends to zero as

r tends to infinity. There exists subsequences

In addition z  log((·, (z))tk(·)) is subharmonic. Consequently,

Hence j,k is subharmonic in the strip 0 (z) 1.
Substep 1.5. We prove that (2.18) holds for any sequence of simple functions {tkfk}kZ  S. Let z = (z) + i(z), 0 (z) 1 and (z)  R. From Substeps 1.2-1.4,  is con-

Similarly we obtain

From our previous substeps log (z) is continuous bounded above and subharmonic in

the strip 0 (z) 1. In addition log (z) does not exceed log M1 and log M2 on the lines (z) = 0 and (z) = 1, respectively. Therefore we apply the Three-Line Theorem

for subharmonic functions to obtain

log (z) (1 - ) log M1 +  log M2, 0 < (z) < 1.

In particular Finally we have proved that

I = () M11-M2.

{tkT (fk)}|Lp(q) M11-M2 {tkfk}|Lp(q)

for each sequence of simple functions {tkfk}. Step 2. We prove (2.18). Let {fk}  Lp(q, {tk}). Then {tkfk}  Lp(q). There exists
{gn}nN = {{gnk}kZ}nN  S  Lp(q) such that {gn}nN converges to {tkfk} in Lp(q). Hence
{t-k 1gnk - fk}|Lp(q, {tk})

tends to zero if n tends to infinity. Therefore

{t-k 1gnk - fk}|Lp(q1, {tk})

tends to zero if n tends to infinity, since Lp(q)  Lp(q1). Observe that

T (fk) - T (t-k 1gnk)

T (fk - t-k 1gnk)

for any k  Z and any n  N. Therefore

{ T (fk) } - { T (t-k 1gnk) }|Lp(q1, {tk})

(2.25)

WEIGTHED LIZORKIN-TRIEBEL SPACES

13

can be estimated by

{T (fk - t-k 1gnk)}|Lp(q1, {tk})

{t-k 1gnk - fk}|Lp(q1, {tk}) ,

where this inequality follows by the fact that (t-k 1gnk)}  Lp(q1, {tk}) since

{t-k 1gnk)}|Lp(q1, {tk}) = {gnk)}|Lp(q1) < .

This yields that {T (fk - t-k 1gnk)}|Lp(q1, {tk})
tends to zero if n tends to infinity. Therefore {{ T (t-k 1gnk) }}nN converges to { T (fk) } in Lp(q1, {tk})-norm, which yields that {{tk T (t-k 1gnk) }}nN converges to {tk T (fk) } in Lp(q1)-norm. Hence {tk T (t-k 1gnk) }nN converges to tk T (fk) in Lp for any k  Z. There exists subsequences {tk T (t-k 1gk k(n)) }nN converges to tk T (fk) almost everywhere, with k(n)  N and k(n + 1) > k(n), k  Z. Here k(n) is independent of k  Z. We have

{T (fk}|Lp(q, {tk}) M11-M2 {fk}|Lp(q, {tk}) for any {tkfk}  Lp(q) and the lemma is proved.
Now we state the main result of this subsection.

Step 1. 1 < q p < . The case p = q follows, e.g., by [14], so we assume that

where the supremum is taking over all sequence of functions {gk}  Lp(q) with

Moreover tk|Lp(Q)   if |Q|   for any k  Z. Hence we can apply Lemma 2.16. Let

3. The spaces Fp,q(Rn, {tk})
In this section we present the Fourier analytical definition of Triebel-Lizorkin spaces of variable smoothness and we prove their basic properties in analogy to the classical Triebel-Lizorkin spaces.

and 

F (2-k)F (2-k) = 1 if  = 0,

(3.3)

k=-
where c > 0. Throughout the paper, for all k  Z and x  Rn, we put k(x) := 2kn(2kx) and ~(x) := (-x). We set

^ S(Rn) :=   S(Rn) : x(x)dx = 0 for all multi-indices   Nn0 .
Rn
Following Triebel [53], we consider S(Rn) as a subspace of S(Rn), including the topology. Thus, S(Rn) is a complete metric space. Equivalently, S(Rn) can be defined as a collection of all   S(Rn) such that semi-norms

 M := sup sup () ||M + ||-M <  || M Rn

for all M  N0, see [5, Section 3]. The semi-norms { · M }MN0 generate a topology of a locally convex space on S(Rn) which coincides with the topology of S(Rn) as a subspace of a locally convex space S(Rn). Let S (Rn) be the topological dual of S(Rn), namely, the set of all continuous linear functionals on S(Rn).
Now, we define the spaces under consideration.

Definition 3.4. Let 0 < p <  and 0 < q . Let {tk} be a p-admissible weight sequence, and   S(Rn) satisfy (3.1) and (3.2). The Triebel-Lizorkin space Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) is the collection of all f  S (Rn) such that

f |Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) :=



1

tqk|k  f |q q |Lp(Rn) < 

k=-

with the usual modifications if q = .

Remark 3.5. We would like to mention that the elements of the spaces Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) are not distributions but equivalence classes of distributions. Observe that Fp,p(Rn, {tk}) is just the space B p,p(Rn, {tk}), where the space B p,q(Rn, {tk}), 0 < p, q , is defined to be the set of all f  S (Rn) such that

f |B p,q(Rn, {tk}) :=



1

tk(k  f )|Lp(Rn) q q < ,

k=-

which studied in detail in [14].

26

D. DRIHEM

Using the system {k} we can define the quasi-norms

f |Fps,q(Rn) :=



1

2ksq|k  f |q q |Lp(Rn)

k=-

for constants s  R, 0 < p <  and 0 < q . The Triebel-Lizorkin space Fps,q(Rn) consist of all distributions f  S (Rn) for which

f |Fps,q(Rn) < .

It is well-known that these spaces do not depend on the choice of the system {k} (up to equivalence of quasi-norms). Further details on the classical theory of these spaces,
included the nonhomogeneous case, can be found in [22], [24], [25], [49], [53], [54] and
[55]. One recognizes immediately that if {tk} = {2sk}, s  R, then Fp,q(Rn, {2sk}) =
Fps,q(Rn). Moreover, for {tk} = {2skw}, s  R with a weight w we re-obtain the weighted Triebel-Lizorkin spaces; we refer, in particular, to the papers [7], [34], [47], [50] and [51]
for a comprehensive treatment of the weighted spaces.
A basic tool to study the above function spaces is the following Caldero´n reproducing
formula, see [62, Lemma 2.1].

Lemma 3.6. Suppose ,   S(Rn) satisfying (3.1) through (3.3). If f  S (Rn), then



f=

2-kn

k  f (2-km)k(· - 2-km).

k=-

mZn

(3.7)

Let ,   S(Rn) satisfying (3.1) through (3.3). Recall that the -transform S is

defined by setting (S)k,m =

f, k,m

where

k,m(x)

=

2k

n 2

(2k

x

-

m),

m



Zn

and

k  Z. The inverse -transform T is defined by



T :=

k,mk,m,

k=- mZn

(3.8)

where  = {k,m}kZ,mZn  C, see [24]. Now we introduce the corresponding sequence spaces of Fp,q(Rn, {tk}).

Definition 3.9. Let 0 < p <  and 0 < q . Let {tk} be a p-admissible weight sequence. Then for all complex valued sequences  = {k,m}kZ,mZn  C we define

fp,q(Rn, {tk}) :=  : |fp,q(Rn, {tk}) <  ,

where

|fp,q(Rn, {tk}) :=



2

knq 2

tqk

|k,m

|q

k,m

k=- mZn

1
q |Lp(Rn) ,

with the usual modifications if q = .

Allowing the smoothness tk, k  Z to vary from point to point will raise extra difficulties to study these function spaces. But by the following lemma the problem can be reduced to the case of fixed smoothness, see [16].

Proposition 3.10. Let 0 <  p < , 0 < q <  and 0 <  1. Assume that {tk}

is an equivalent quasi-norm in fp,q(Rn, {tk}), where

tk,m, := tk|Lp(Qk,m) , k  Z, m  Zn.

The following important properties of the sequence spaces will be required in what follows.

Lemma 3.11. Let 0 <  p <  and 0 < q < . Let {tk} be a p-admissible weight

sequence satisfying (2.8) with 1 = 

p 



and

j

=

Let k  Z, m  Zn and  

fp,q(Rn, {tk}). Then there exists c > 0 independent of k and m such that

|k,m|

Proof. Let   fp,q(Rn, {tk}), k  Z and m  Zn. Since {tk} is a p-admissible sequence

satisfying (2.8) with 1 =

, we get by H¨older's inequality

where c > 0 is independent of k  Z and m  Zn.

Lemma 3.12. Let  = (1, 2)  R2, 0 <  p <  and 0 < q . Let {tk}  X ,,p be

a p-admissible weight sequence with  = (1 = 

p

p). Let   S(Rn) satisfying

(3.1) and (3.2). Then for all   fp,q(Rn, {tk})



T :=

k,mk,m,

k=- mZn

converges in S (Rn); moreover, T : fp,q(Rn, {tk})  S (Rn) is continuous.

The proof for this lemma is the same as the one given in [14].

For a sequence  = {k,m}kZ,mZn  C, 0 < r  and a fixed d > 0, set

k,m,r,d :=

|k,h|r

1/r

(1 + 2k|2-kh - 2-km|)d
hZn

and r,d := {k,m,r,d}kZ,mZn  C.

Lemma 3.13. Let  = (1, 2)  R2, 0 <  p < , 0 < q < ,   Z and d > n.

Let {tk} be a p-admissible weight sequence satisfying (2.8) with 1 = 

p 

 and 1  R.

Then

p,d|fp,q(Rn, {tk-})  |fp,q(Rn, {tk-}) .

(3.14)

In addition if {tk} satisfying (2.9) with 2 p and 2  R, then

where

A=

Let y  zj Qk,z and x  Qk,m. Then y  Qk,z for some z  j and 2j-1 < |z - m| 2j. From this it follows that

Now we have the following result which is called the -transform characterization in the sense of Frazier and Jawerth. It will play an important role in the rest of the paper.

Theorem 3.18. Let  = (1, 2)  R2, 0 <  p <  and 0 < q < . Let {tk}  X ,,p

be a p-admissible weight sequence with  = (1 = 

p 

 , 2

p). Let ,   S(Rn)

satisfying (3.1) through (3.3). The operators

S : Fp,q(Rn, {tk})  fp,q(Rn, {tk})

and T : fp,q(Rn, {tk})  Fp,q(Rn, {tk})
are bounded. Furthermore, T  S is the identity on Fp,q(Rn, {tk}).

Proof. The proof is a straightforward adaptation of [24, Theorem 2.2] and [14]. For any f  S (Rn) we put sup(f ) := {supk,m(f )}kZ,mZn where

sup(f ) := 2-kn/2 sup |k  f (y)|, k Z, m  Zn.

k,m

yQk,m

For any N0, we define the sequence inf(f ) := {infk,m,(f )}kZ,mZn by setting

infk,m, (f

k Z, m  Zn,

where k := 2kn(-2k·). Step 1. In this step we prove that

f |Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) .

Define a sequence  = {j,h}jZ,hZn by

Step 2. We will prove that

inf(f )|fp,q(Rn, {tk})  f |Fp,q(Rn, {tk})  sup(f )|fp,q(Rn, {tk}) .

(3.19)

Applying Lemma A.4 of [24], see also Lemma 8.3 of [6], to the function (k  f )(2-jx) we obtain
inf(f )p,d  sup(f )p,d.
Hence for  > 0 sufficiently large we obtain by applying Lemma 3.13,

inf(f )p,d|fp,q(Rn, {tk})  inf(f )|fp,q(Rn, {tk})

and sup(f )p,d|fp,q(Rn, {tk})  sup(f )|fp,q(Rn, {tk}) .

Therefore,

inf(f )|fp,q(Rn, {tk})  sup(f )|fp,q(Rn, {tk}) .

From the definition of the spaces Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) it follows that

f |Fp,q(Rn, {tk})

sup(f )|fp,q(Rn, {tk}) .

(3.20)

Consequently (3.20) and Step 1 yield (3.19). Step 3. In this step we prove the boundedness of S and T. We have

|(Sf )k,m| = | f, k,m | = 2-kn/2|f  k(2-km)| sup(f ).
k,m

Step 2 yields that

Sf |fp,q(Rn, {tk})

f |Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) .

To prove the boundedness of T suppose  = {j,h}jZ,hZn and

we also have (3.21) with p > 1. Hence if x  Qk+1,z  Qk,m  Qk-1,l, then we have

The proof is complete.

Remark 3.22. This theorem can then be exploited to obtain a variety of results for the Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) spaces, where arguments can be equivalently transferred to the sequence space, which is often more convenient to handle. More precisely, under the same hypothesis of the last theorem,

{ f, k,m }kZ,mZn |fp,q(Rn, {tk})  {f |Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) .

From Theorem 3.18, we obtain the next important property of the function spaces Fp,q(Rn, {tk}).

Corollary 3.23. Let  = (1, 2)  R2, 0 <  p <  and 0 < q < . Let {tk}  X ,,p

be a p-admissible weight sequence with  = (1 = 

p 

 , 2

p). The definition of the

spaces Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) is independent of the choices of   S(Rn) satisfying (3.1) and (3.2).

Lemma 3.24. Let 0 <  p <  and 0 < q < . Let {tk} be a p-admissible weight sequence. fp,q(Rn, {tk}) are quasi-Banach spaces. They are Banach spaces if 1 p <  and 1 q < .

Proof. We need only to assume that 1 sequence in fp,q(Rn, {tk}) such that

Applying this lemma and Theorem 3.18 we obtain the following useful properties of these function spaces, see [27].

Theorem 3.25. Let  = (1, 2)  R2, 0 <  p <  and 0 < q . Let {tk}  X ,,p

be a p-admissible weight sequence with  = (1 = 

p 

 , 2

p). Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) are

quasi-Banach spaces. They are Banach spaces if 1 p <  and 1 q < .

Theorem 3.26. Let 0 <  p <  and 0 < q < . Let {tk}  X ,,p be a p-admissible

weight sequence with  = (1 = 

p 

 , 2

p) and  = (1, 2)  R2.

(i) We have the embedding

S(Rn)  Fp,q(Rn, {tk}).
In addition S(Rn) is dense in Fp,q(Rn, {tk}. (ii) We have the embedding

(3.27)

Fp,q(Rn, {tk})  S (Rn).

Proof. The proof is a slight variant of [14]. For the convenience of the reader, we give some details. The embedding (3.27) follows by

S(Rn)  B p,min(p,q)(Rn, {tk})  Fp,q(Rn, {tk}), see [14] for the first embedding. We prove the density of S(Rn) in Fp,q(Rn, {tk}). Let ,   S(Rn) satisfying (3.1) through (3.3) and f  Fp,q(Rn, {tk}). Let

fN :=

~k  k  f,

N  N.

Observe that

j  ~k = 0, if k / {j - 1, j, j + 1}.

WEIGTHED LIZORKIN-TRIEBEL SPACES

Then, by Lemma 2.26,

fN |Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) =

1
|tk(k  ~k  ¯k  f )|q q |Lp(Rn)

|k| N +1

1
|tkM (k  f )|q q |Lp(Rn)

|k| N +1

f |Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) < 

for any N  N where ¯k = k-1 + k + k+1, k  Z and 0 <  < min(1, p, q). The first inequality follows by Lemma 2.4 of [12]. Consequently,

f - fN |Fp,q(Rn, {tk})

1
|tk(k  ~k  ¯k  f )|q q |Lp(Rn)
|k| N +1
1
|tkM (k  f )|q q |Lp(Rn)
|k| N +1
1
|tk(k  f )|q q |Lp(Rn) ,
|k| N +1

where we used again Lemma 2.26. The dominated convergence theorem implies that fN approximate f in Fp,q(Rn, {tk}). But fN , N  N is not necessary an element of S(Rn), so we need to approximate fN in S (Rn). Let   S (Rn) with (0) = 1 and suppF   { : || 1}. Put

fN, := fN (·), 0 <  < 1. We have fN,  S (Rn) see [61, Lemma 5.3], and

N

fN - fN, =

(~k  k  f )(1 - (·)).

k=-N

After simple calculation, we obtain

^
j  [(~k  k  f )((·))](x) = k  f (y)j  (~k((· + y))(x - y)dy, x  Rn,
Rn

which together with the fact that

suppF (~k((· + y))  { : 2k-2 || 2k+1}, y  Rn, |k| N

if 0 <  < 2-N-3 yield that

j  [(~k  k  f )((·))] = 0 if |j - k| 2.

Therefore, we obtain that can be estimated by

D. DRIHEM

Again, by Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem fN, approximate fN in the spaces Fp,q(Rn, {tk}). This prove that S(Rn) is dense in Fp,q(Rn, {tk}).
The proof of (ii) follows by the embedding
Fp,q(Rn, {tk})  B p,max(p,q)(Rn, {tk})  S (Rn),
where the second embedding is proved in [14].

3.2. Embeddings. For our spaces introduced above we want to show Sobolev embedding
theorems. We recall that a quasi-Banach space A1 is continuously embedded in another quasi-Banach space A2, A1  A2, if A1  A2 and there is a c > 0 such that

f |A2 c f |A1

for all f  A1. We begin with the following elementary embeddings.

Theorem 3.28. Let 0 < p <  and 0 < q r < . Let {tk}  X ,,p be a p-admissible

weight sequence with  = (1 = 

p 

 , 2

p). We have

Fp,q(Rn, {tk})  Fp,r(Rn, {tk}).

The proof can be obtained by using the properties of sequence Lebesgue spaces. The main result of this subsection is the following Sobolev-type embedding. In the classical setting this was done in [35] and [53]. We set

^

wk,Q(p1) :=

wkp1(x)dx p1 and tk,Q(p0) :=

tpk0(x)dx , p0 Q  Q

with (Q) = 2-k.

Theorem 3.29. Let 0 <  p0 < p1 <  and 0 < q, r < . Let {tk} be a p0-admissible

weight sequence satisfying (2.8) with p = p0, 1 = 

p0 

 and j = k.

Let {wk} be a

p1-admissible weight sequence satisfying (2.8) with p = p1, 1 = 

p1 

 and j = k.

If

wk,Q(p1) tk,Q(p0) for all Q  Q with (Q) = 2-k, then we have

fp0,q(Rn, {tk})  fp1,r(Rn, {wk}).

Proof. Let f  fp0,q(Rn, {tk}). Without loss of generality, we may assume that |fp0,q(Rn, {tk}) = 1.

We set

fk(x) :=

Using Proposition 3.10 and the fact that

we obtain

3.3. Atomic and molecular decompositions. We will use the notation of [24]. We shall
say that an operator A is associated with the matrix {aQk,mPv,h}k,vZ,m,hZn, if for all sequences  = {k,m}kZ,mZn  C,

A = {(A)k,m}kZ,mZn :=

We will use the following notations

We say that A, with associated matrix {aQk,mPv,h}k,vZ,m,hZn, is almost diagonal on fp,q(Rn, {tk}) if there exists  > 0 such that

We will use the notation {bk,m}kZ,mZn instead of {bQk,m}kZ,mZn. The proof of the following lemma is given in [14].

Lemma 3.45. Let 1, 2, J, M, N, , , p and q be as in Definition 3.36. Let {tk} be a p-admissible weight sequence. Suppose {v,h}vZ,hZn is a family of smooth synthesis molecules for Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) and {bk,m}kZ,mZn is a family of homogeneous smooth analysis molecules for Fp,q(Rn, {tk}). Then there exist a positive real number 1 and a positive constant c such that
| v,h, bk,m | c Qk,mPv,h(), k, v  Z, h, m  Zn
if  1.

As an immediate consequence, we have the following analogues of the corresponding results on [24, Corollary B.3].

Corollary 3.46. Let 1, 2, J, M, N, , , p and q be as in Definition 3.36. Let {tk} be a p-admissible weight sequence. Let  and  satisfy, respectively (3.1) and (3.2). (i) If {k,m}kZ,mZn is a family of homogeneous synthesis molecules for the TriebelLizorkin spaces Fp,q(Rn, {tk}), then the operator A with matrix aQk,mPv,h = v,h, k,m , k, v  Z, m, h  Zn, is almost diagonal. (ii) If {bk,m}kZ,mZn is a family of homogeneous smooth analysis molecules for the TriebelLizorkin spaces Fp,q(Rn, {tk}), then the operator A, with matrix aQk,mPv,h = v,h, bQk,m , k, v  Z, m, h  Zn, is almost diagonal.

Let f  Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) and {bk,m}kZ,mZn be a family of homogeneous smooth analysis molecules. To prove that f, bQk,m , k  Z, m  Zn, is well defined for all homogeneous smooth analysis molecules for Fp,q(Rn, {tk}, we need the following result, which proved in [5, Lemma 5.4]. Suppose that  is a smooth analysis (or synthesis) molecule supported near Q  Q . Then there exists a sequence {k}kN  S(Rn) and c > 0 such that ck is a smooth analysis (or synthesis) molecule supported near Q for every k,and k(x)  (x) uniformly on Rn as k  .
Now we have the following smooth molecular characterization of Fp,q(Rn, {tk}), see [14] for Besov spaces and the same arguments are true for Triebel-Lizorkin spaces.

Theorem 3.47. Let 1, 2  R, 0 <  p <  and 0 < q < . Let {tk}k  X ,,p be a

p-admissible weight sequence with 1 =

f |Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) .

Proof. The proof is a slight variant of [24] and [14]. For the convenience of the reader, we give some details.
Step 1. Proof of (i). By (3.7) we can write



v,h =

for any v  Z, h  Zn. Therefore,

f |Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) = TS|Fp,q(Rn, {tk})

S|fp,q(Rn, {tk}) .

But 

Sk,m =

a  Qk,mPv,h v,h

v=- hZn

with

a = Qk,mPv,h v,h, k,m , k, v  Z, m, h  Zn.

Applying Lemma 3.45 and Theorem 3.34 we find that

S|fp,q(Rn, {tk})

|fp,q(Rn, {tk}) .

Step 2. Proof of (ii). We have

f, bk,m



=

2-vn

v(· - 2-vh), bk,m v  f (2-vh)

v=- 

mZn

=

v,h, bk,m v,h

v=- mZn 

=

a  , Qk,mPv,h v,h

v=- hZn

where a = Qk,mPv,h v,h, bk,m , v,h = 2-vn/2v  f (2-vh).
Again by Lemma 3.45 and Theorem 3.34 we find that

{ f, bk,m }kZ,mZn|fp,q(Rn, {tk})

{v,h}vZ,hZn |fp,q(Rn, {tk})

= c {(S)v,h}vZ,hZn |fp,q(Rn, {tk}) .

Applying Theorem 3.18 we find that

{ f, bk,m }kZ,mZn|fp,q(Rn, {tk})

f |Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) .

The proof is complete.

Definition 3.48. Let 1, 2  R, 0 < p < , 0 < q <  and N = max{J - n - 1, -1}. Let {tk} be a p-admissible weight sequence. A function aQv,m is called an homogeneous smooth atom for Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) supported near Qk,m, k  Z and m  Zn, if

supp aQk,m  3Qk,m

(3.49)

|aQk,m (x)| 2kn(||+1/2) if 0

and if

^ xaQk,m (x)dx = 0
Rn

|| max(0, 1 + 2), x  Rn if 0 || N and k  Z.

(3.50) (3.51)

A collection {aQk,m}kZ,mZn is called a family of homogeneous smooth atoms for Fp,q(Rn, {tk}), if each aQk,m is an homogeneous smooth atom for Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) supported near Qv,m. We point out that in the moment condition (3.51) can be strengthened into that
^ xaQk,m(x)dx = 0 if 0 || N~ and k  Z
Rn
and the regularity condition (3.50) can be strengthened into that

| aQk,m(x)| 2kn(||+1/2) if 0 || K~ , x  Rn,
where K~ and N~ are arbitrary fixed integer satisfying K~ max(0, 1 + 2) and N~ max{J - n - 1, -1}. If an atom a is supported near Qv,m, then we denote it by av,m.
Now we come to the atomic decomposition theorem, see [14] for Besov spaces and the same arguments are true for Triebel-Lizorkin spaces.

Theorem 3.52. Let 1, 2  R, 0 <  p < , 0 < q < . Let {tk}k  X ,,p be a p-

admissible weight sequence with 1 = 

p 

 and 2

p. Then for each f  Fp,q(Rn, {tk}),

there exist a family {k,m}kZ,mZn of homogeneous smooth atoms for Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) and

 = {k,m}kZ,mZn  fp,q(Rn, {tk}) such that



f=

k,mk,m,

k=- mZn

converging in S (Rn),

and

{k,m}kZ,mZn |fp,q(Rn, {tk})

f |Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) .

Conversely, for any family of homogeneous smooth atoms for Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) and  = {k,m}kZ,mZn  fp,q(Rn, {tk})


k,mk,m|Fp,q(Rn, {tk})
k=- mZn

{k,m}kZ,mZn|fp,q(Rn, {tk}) .

Remark 3.53. (i) Further results, concerning, for instance, characterizations via oscillations, box spline and tensor-product B-spline representations are given in [13]. (ii) We mention that the techniques of [33] are incapable of dealing with spaces of variable smoothness. Also our assumptions on the weight {tk} play an exceptional role in the paper. (iii) We draw the reader's attention to paper [40] where generalized Besov-type and Triebel-Lizorkin-type spaces are studied. They assumed that the weight sequence {tk} lies in some class which different from the class X ,,p.
Remark 3.54. One of the applications of atomic and molecular decompositions of the spaces Fp,q(Rn, {tk}) is studying the continuity of singular integral operators of non convolution type in such function spaces, where it is enough to show that it maps every family of smooth atoms into a family of smooth molecules. For classical Triebel-Lizorkin spaces we refer the reader to, e.g., [23] and [56]. I hope that this paper will help to encourage more work on the theory of function spaces, harmonic analysis and their applications.
