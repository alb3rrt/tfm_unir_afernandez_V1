We show that the invariance of an entanglement measure under Stochastic Local Operations with Classical Communication (SLOCC) expands to its convex roof extension. SLOCC may be represented by Mo¨bius transformations on the roots of the entanglement measure on the Bloch sphere. We derive efficient conditions for n-qubit states to be SLOCC-equivalent. We apply our approach on 4-qubit states and show that roots of the 3-tangle measure classify 4-qubit generic states. Moreover, we propose a method to obtain the normal form of a 4-qubit state which bypasses the possibly infinite iterative procedure.

Quantum entanglement is one of the key manifestations of quantum mechanics and the main resource for all technologies founded on quantum information science. In particular, quantum states with non-equivalent entanglement represent distinct resources which may be useful for different protocols. The idea of clustering states into classes that exhibit different qualities under quantum information processing tasks resulted in their classification under stochastic local operations assisted by classical communication (SLOCC) for two, three and four qubits [1­4]. Mathematically, SLOCC interconvertibility defines an equivalence class of states which can be transformed from one another by the action of a local invertible operator L  SL(2, C)n [1].
Among several approaches to the entanglement quantification and classification problem, a particularly useful one is via polynomial invariant measures. An entanglement measure is a function E(| ) defined for all pure states of n qubits which vanishes on the set of separable states. An entanglement measure E(| ) defined on the system of n qubits is called a polynomial invariant of homogeneous degree h if it is polynomial in the coefficients of a pure state | and satisfies the equality E L | = hE | for each real constant  > 0 and invertible linear operator L  SL(2, C)n [1, 5, 6]. Polynomial invariants provide not only a convenient method for entanglement classification but also its practical detection. Indeed, it was shown that almost all SLOCC equivalence classes can be distinguished by ratios of SL(2, C)-invariant homogeneous polynomials [3]. In addition, entanglement monotones derived from SL(2, C)-invariant polynomials can be rewritten in terms of expectation values of observables [7], which opens the door for experimental SLOCC classification via the measurement of correlation functions of local operators.
Beyond the scope of pure states, one may extend a

given entanglement measure E on the set of mixed states by determining the largest convex function on the set of mixed states which coincides with E on the set of pure states [8]. Such a function is called the convex roof extension of a measure E on the mixed state , and it reads E  := min{pi,|i } i piE |i where the minimum is taken over all convex decompositions of  into pure states, i.e.  = i pi |i i|. Despite its simple definition, the evaluation of a convex roof extension for a general density matrix  is a challenging task [9­12]. An auspicious attempt to tackle this generally hard problem was carried out by introducing the so-called zeropolytope, a convex hull of all pure states with vanishing E measure [13­16]. In the particular case of rank-2 density matrices , the zero-polytope can be represented inside a Bloch sphere, spanned by the roots of E [6, 14]. The zero-polytope not only embodies an elegant way of visualizing entanglement measures but is also useful in quickly determining if a given entanglement measure E is zero, by verifying whether the density operator can be constructed as a combination of the roots of E.
Another successful link between entanglement classification and geometry was established for permutationsymmetric states. Any permutation-symmetric state can be represented either in a coherent state representation (known as Dicke states [17]), or as a system of n stars on the Bloch sphere, called Majorana representation [18]. Those two representations are linked by the Majorana polynomial, whose roots determine the associated system of points on the sphere by the stereographic projection [19]. The Majorana representation is especially convenient for studying SLOCC transformations, which are represented by the well-studied M¨obius transformations [19, 20], and has become a useful tool to study permutation-symmetric states [21­23].
In this letter, we provide a consistent geometrical representation of a convex roof extension of any SL(2, C)n-

2

invariant polynomial measure evaluated on the system of (n + 1) qubits. Similarly to permutation-symmetric states, the system of roots of an SL(2, C)n invariant polynomial E is represented on the Bloch sphere and it is shown that it transforms via M¨obius transformations under SLOCC actions. We then derive sufficient and necessary conditions for generic (n + 1)-qubit states to be SLOCC-equivalent, for which we explicitely demonstrate possible advantages for four qubit states. This method thus paves the way for a deeper understanding of the invariant structures that characterize the entanglement classification under SLOCC operations.

System of roots and the zero-polytope-- Consider an n+1 partite qubit state | , and an SL(2, C)n-invariant polynomial measure E of homogeneous degree h defined
on n-partited pure qubit states. The state | can be
uniquelly written as

| = |0 |0 + |1 |1 ,

(1)

providing the canonical decomposition of the reduced
density matrix = |0 0| + |1 1| obtained by tracing out the first qubit. Note that the states |0 and |1 are in general neither normalized nor orthogonal. Consider now the following family of states

|z = z |0 + |1 ,

(2)

where z  C^ are taken from the extended complex plane C^ , i.e., complex numbers plus infinity. We denote this the extended plane representation. Since E is a SL(2, C)ninvariant degree-h homogeneous polynomial of the coef-
ficients of | z, it will also be a polynomial of degree h in the complex variable z [13]. Therefore, the polynomial
E(z |0 + |1 ) has exactly h roots: 1, . . . , h (which may be degenerated and/or at infinity).
By using the complex number z, the states |z can be mapped to the surface of a sphere via the standard
stereographic projection (, ) := (arctan 1/|z|, -arg z)
written in spherical coordinates. This way, a point on the
unit 2-sphere (, ) can be associated with the quantum
state

|z

 := cos 2 |0

+

sin

 2

ei

|1

(3)

with z = ctg(/2) e-i, such that |0 lies in the North pole and |1 lies in the South pole, see Figure 1. We denote this the Bloch sphere representation. Note that
|z  |z and that neither of these states is normalized, since |0 and |1 are not normalized in general either. As it will soon become clear, it is precisely this
non-normalization that distinguishes our approach for visualizing SL(2, C)n-invariant polynomials on the Bloch sphere from others [6, 13, 14, 16, 24]. Despite the non-
normalization of |0 and |1 , the Bloch ball interpretation of points inside the sphere of still valid, i.e. vectors

inside the sphere can still be consistently associated to

mixed quantum states (see Supplemental Material Sec-

tion 1 for more details).

States |i = i |0 + |1 associated with the roots

of the polynomial E represented as points |i on the

Bloch sphere span the (renormalized) zero-polytope, i.e.

the convex hull of points

h i=1

µi

|i

i |,

i µi = 1

from the Bloch ball. We call it renormalized polytope

since it differs from the usual definition in the literature

in that |0 and |1 are not normalized. Any mixed

state i µi |zi zi | has vanishing E measure iff the corresponding Bloch ball vector is contained in the zero-

polytope. In particular, any entanglement measure E

vanishes on the the initial reduced state n = |0 0| + |1 1| iff the center of a Bloch ball is contained in the zero-polytope.

Local operations on the zero-polytope--To each invert-

ible operator O =

ab cd

 SL(2, C), one may associate

a M¨obius transformation z  z

:=

az+b cz+d

,

mapping

the

extended complex plane C^ into itself. The composition

of such transformations thus represents the multiplica-

tion of the associated operators. In particular, z  z :=

dz-b -cz+a

is

an

inverse

M¨obius

transformation

related

with

O-1 =

d -b -c a

. Note that although M¨obius transforma-

tions are typically represented on the extended complex

plane, one may represent them as transformations on the

Bloch sphere via the stereographic projection. To study

the effect of SLOCC operations on the zero-polytope we

begin by acting on the first qubit of a state | written

in the form (1) with an invertible linear operator O. In

terms of the family of states |z in (2), this operation

induces the map

az + b

|z  |z = cz + d |0 + |1 ,

(4)

i.e. the index is mapped via the M¨obius transformation

zz

:=

az+b cz+d

(see Supplementary Material Section 2

for more details). In addition, since |z  |z , we have

that the family of states |z also transforms according

to Eq. (4). This reflects the fact that the states |z and

|z associated to the extended complex plane and the

Bloch sphere are related by a stereographic projection of

the variable z. Using Eq. (4) and the defining equation

E(i |0 +|1 ) = 0 for the roots i of the polynomial E,

one concludes that the roots transform according to the

inverse M¨obius transformation associated to the operator

O,

i.e.

i



di -b -ci +a

.

As

a

consequence,

the

zero-polytope

is distorted according to the same inverse M¨obius trans-

formation. It is crucial to emphasize that normalizing the

states |0 and |1 after the action of the operator O,

as is the case in existing related works [6, 13, 14, 16, 24],

would spoil the mapping of Eq. (4), and as a consequence

the action of SLOCC operators on the states |z would

3

no longer be given by the corresponding M¨obius transformation. Finally, although the zero-polytope changes with local operations acting on the qubit that is being traced out in Eq. (1), it is invariant under local operations acting on any other qubit since the polynomial E is SL(2, C)n invariant.
We summarize these results in the theorem below (see Supplementary Material Section 2 for a proof).
Theorem 1. Consider an SL(2, C)n-invariant polynomial measure E of homogeneous degree h defined on (n + 1)-partite pure qubit states. Consider also a quantum state | = |0 |0 +|1 |1 and any invertible linear transformation O  On  SL(2, C)n+1. The roots i of

the renormalized zero-polytope associated to the partial trace of the first qubit:
1. are invariant under 1  On  SL(2, C)n operators;

2. transforms via the inverse M¨obius transform i =

di -b -ci +a

w.r.t

the

O

=

ab cd

 1n operator.

Moreover, the entanglement measure vanishes on the reduced state E(|0 0| + |1 1|) = 0 iff the center of the Bloch ball is contained in the renormalized zeropolytope.

Figure 1. On the left, we have the stereographic projection relating the family of states |z on the extended complex plane
with the associated family of states |z on the Bloch sphere. The spherical coordinates (, ) and the complex coordinate z are related via the stereographic projection z = ctg(/2) e-i. In the center, the roots of the 3-tangle polynomial measure  (3) evaluated on the first subsystem of |0 |GHZ + |1 |W state span the renormalized zero-polytope. This system of four points can be mapped into a normal system (i.e. symmetrically related points z, -z, 1/z, -1/z) by a Mo¨bius transformation, resulting in a zero-polytope with opposite sides of equal length. Similar local transformations can be performed with respect to other subsystems, transforming the states into a state in the normal form.

SLOCC equivalence and normal systems­The decom-

position (1) can be performed with respect to any other

subsystem, each with its own system of roots that spans

a zero-polytope. This is particularly important for en-

tanglement classification schemes where the presence of

entanglement after partial trace of a qubit is an as-

pect of focus, such as in [25, 26]. Any local operator

Ok =

ab cd

acting on the k-th qubit will influence inde-

pendently the corresponding k-th system of roots and its

associated zero-polytope via the M¨obius transformation

i



di -b -ci +a

.

On

the

other

hand,

if

acting

globally

with

a local operator O1  · · ·  On+1, all roots (and thus all

zero-polytopes) will be affected. Since a M¨obius trans-

formation is a bijective mapping on the Bloch sphere,

the total number of roots will always be preserved [24].

Moreover, the existence of a local transformation between

two given states becomes straightforward to verify since

M¨obius transformations are fully classified. Any three distinct points on the sphere can be trans-
formed onto any other three distinct points via a unique M¨obius transformation. While this is not the case for four points, it is possible to take any four complex points z1, z2, z3, z4 and associate a so-called cross-ratio

 z1, z2, z3, z4

:= z3 - z1 z4 - z2 , z3 - z2 z4 - z1

(5)

which is preserved under M¨obius transformations [20, 22].

Systems of four distinct points are related via M¨obius

transformations if they cross-ratios are related in the

same way. The cross-ratio is not invariant under per-

mutations of points, however, and depending on the or-

dering taken for the four points, it takes six values:

,

1 

,

1-,

1 1-

,

-1 

,

 -1

[22].

A particular

interesting set

of four points is one of the form z, 1/z, -z, -1/z, which

we call a normal system. Any set of four points may be

4

mapped into a normal system, for which z, 1/z, -z, -1/z

will be the solutions of the fourth degree equation  =

4z2/(1 + z2)2, where  is a corresponding cross-ratio (5).

Such a map is unique up to symmetries of the cube, i.e the

group of 24 rotations generated by /2 rotations along

the X, Y, Z axis, denoted by G24.

It is particularly straightforward how one may use

the normal system of roots for SLOCC-classification of

small dimensional systems. Focusing first on the three-

qubit case, genuinely entangled pure states are SLOCC-
equivalent to either |GHZ = 1 (|000 + |111 ) or |W =
2
1 (|001 +|010 +|100 ) [27]. Using the 2-tangle  (2) [28]
3
as the entanglement measure, one may use the roots to

distinguish between the two classes. Indeed, all rank-2

reduced density matrices of the |W state have a single

root, while there are always two distinct roots for the

|GHZ state [6].

Contrary to the three qubit case, there are infinitely

many SLOCC classes of four qubit states [27]. Al-

though four qubit states were divided into nine families

[2, 29, 30], we will focus on generic 4-qubit states, i.e. 4-

qubit states with random coefficients belonging to the so

called Gabcd family - the 4-qubit SLOCC family with the

most degrees of freedom. The representative state is of

the form |Gabcd

=

a+d 2

|0000 + |1111

+

a-d 2

|0011 +

|1100

+

b+c 2

|0101

+ |1010

+

b-c 2

|0110

+ |1001

,

where a2 = b2 = c2 = d2 are pairwise different. Choos-

ing the 3-tangle  (3) [31] as the entanglement measure,

the states |Gabcd have four non-degenerate roots already in the normal form (see Supplementary Material Section

4). Since the normal form of roots is unique up to the

group G24, the problem of SLOCC-equivalence of states |Gabcd becomes solvable, with a discrete amount of solutions. Indeed, it can quickly be confirmed if two states in

the Gabcd class are SLOCC equivalent by checking if one
can be obtained from the other by the action an element of the finite class of operators O  G244. We thus find that exactly 192 states of the form |Gabcd are SLOCC-
equivalent.

Proposition 1. Two states |Gabcd and |Ga b c d are SLOCC-equivalent iff their coefficients are related by the following three operations: multiplication by a phase factor (a , b , c , d ) = ei(a, b, c, d), and permutation of coefficients (a , b , c , d ) = (a, b, c, d), and change of sign in front of two coefficients from a, b, c, d.

See Supplementary Material Section 4 for a more detailed analysis. The symmetry in Proposition 1 is given by the Weyl group of Cartan type D4 and it has already been observed that the generators of four-qubit polynomial invariants exhibit this type of symmetry [29, 32]. As a consequence, this result constitutes a new relation between 4-qubit invariants and the convex roof extension of 3tangle  (3), which may shed some light on the problem of generalizing the CKW inequality [33] for four qubit

states [5, 11, 12, 34].

Finally, we remark a link between normal systems of

roots and the normal form of pure states of four qubits

belonging to the Gabcd class. A state is in normal form if all its reductions are maximally mixed [35]. Although

the process to determine the normal form of a state (if

it exists) is straightforward, it may also turn out to be

an infinite iterative process [35]. However, the results of

Theorem 1 applied to the four qubits states of the Gabcd class show that this difficulty can be avoided. Indeed,

the representative state of the Gabcd family is in normal form [35] and its corresponding roots associated with the

 (3) measure also form a normal system. Thus, one may

calculate the roots associated with any state in the Gabcd class, quickly transform them into a normal system of

roots using a M¨obius transformation and use the associ-

ated SLOCC operator to convert the initial state into a

state in the normal form. We illustrate this procedure

by transforming the widely discussed four-partite state
1 (|0 |GHZ + |1 |W ) [14, 16] into its normal form, see
2
Figure 1. Without this technique, the standard way of

obtaining the normal form would indeed result in an in-

finite iterative procedure.

The problem of discriminating (n + 1)-qubit states up

to SLOCC-equivalence is, in general, demanding [36­39]

but the results of Theorem 1 provide a convenient method

to verify such equivalence. The procedure uses the fact

that the M¨obius transformation associated with SLOCC

operation transforms a system of roots of polynomial in-

variants of a given state onto a system of roots of an

equivalent state. For two states, this procedure begins by choosing any SL(2, C)n-polynomial invariant mea-

sure of degree h  3 and calculating its roots for each

subsystem of both given states. Note that a generic state

will always have h roots for each subsystem. Focusing on

one subsystem i, 1  i  n + 1, we choose 3 of the h

roots from each state, which we know to be related by

a unique M¨obius transformation. This results in a local

operator Oi associated with that transformation. Similarly, we find all other local operators which transform

the aforementioned 3 roots of the first state onto any

other triplets of ordered roots of the second state, with

exactly

3!

h 3

possibilities. We repeat this procedure for

all other subsystems and then consider tensor products

of all the obtained local operators. This way, we get

a finite set of operators of the form O1  · · ·  On+1. If the two given (n+1)-qubit states are SLOCC-equivalent,

one of these operators will transform one state into the

other, greatly restricting the search space of possible op-

erators relating the two states. This approach thus has

two main important features. Firstly, it factorizes the

problem of finding SLOCC-equivalence, i.e. local opera-

tions are determined separately for each subsystem. Sec-

ondly, it discretizes the initial discrimination task since

there

are

at

most

(3!

h 3

)n+1

local

operators

which

might

provide SLOCC equivalence between initial states.

5

Conclusions--In this letter, we demonstrated that the roots of any SL(2, C)n-invariant polynomial measure together with the spanned zero-polytope transform via Mo¨bius transformations under the SLOCC operations performed on the subsystems. This leads to a general criterion for the discrimination of pure (n + 1)-partite entangled states in terms of SL(2, C)n-invariant polynomials. We demonstrated our approach on 4-qubit states, showing that the roots of the 3-tangle measure  (3) are enough to classify 4-qubit states from the most generic Gabcd family. Lastly, a procedure was presented to determine the normal form of states in the Gabcd family that circumvents the possibility of an infinite iterative process of the standard procedure.

Supplemental Materials: Entanglement classification via roots of polynomial invariants

SECTION 1. PROOF OF VALIDITY OF THE BLOCH BALL INTERPRETATION

The classical Bloch sphere is a unit 2-sphere with poles corresponding to a pair of orthonormal vectors |0 = |0 and |1 = |1 . Pure quantum states are associated with points on the sphere, while mixed states with points inside the sphere, i.e. in the Bloch ball. In particular, the center of a Bloch ball corresponds to the maximally mixed state
 = (1/2)(|0 0| + |1 1|). Here it is shown that one may relax the condition of orthonormality of vectors |0 and |1 and obtain a more
general Bloch representation. Begin by considering any two quantum states |0 and |1 , assumed to be linearly independent for simplicity. To each point inside the unit 3-dimensional ball

c = (cx, cy, cz) , |c |  1,

(S1)

we associate a mixed state

1 c = 2

1^ + cx^x + cy^y + cz^z

,

(S2)

where, motivated by Pauli matrices, we define 1^, ^i by

1^ := |0 0| + |1 1| , ^z := |0 0| - |1 1| , ^x := |0 1| + |1 0| , ^y := - i |0 1| + i |1 0| .

Under the assumption of linear independence of |0 and |1 , the matrices 1^, ^x, ^y, ^z are also linearly independent and thus each mixed state c is uniquely determined by the associated Bloch ball vector c. Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the mixed states c of the form Eq. (S2) and the vectors c from the Bloch ball.
Indeed, two vectors c and c coincides iff the corresponding mixed states are the same, i.e c = c  c = c . Note that the states |0 and |1 are not normalized and neither are the mixed states c. In this more general Bloch ball picture, the center still associated with  = 1/2 (|0 0| + |1 1|), and a point c on the surface of a 2-sphere







c = sin cos, sin sin, cos , |c| = 1,

as we expect. As a final consistency check, consider any convex combination

(S5)

of vectors |i from the surface of the sphere, i.e |i are of the form Eq. (S4). Since  can be written in the form Eq. (S2), there exists a uniquely associated c from the Bloch ball. In addition, to each vector |i corresponds a unit vector c|i i| from the Bloch sphere, so by expressing all states |i i| in the form Eq. (S2), one obtains

c =

µic|i i| .

(S6)

Therefore, it follows immediately, that equivalent convex combinations of vectors from the Bloch sphere

µi |i i| = j |j j | ,

µi = j = 1,

(S7)

are associated with the same Bloch vector inside the Bloch ball. This entire construction reduces to the standard Bloch ball interpretation by taking |0 = |0 and |1 = |1 .

SECTION 2. PROOF OF THEOREM 1

We present a proof for Theorem 1. Any n + 1 partite qubit state |  H2(n+1) might be written as

| = |0 |0 + |1 |1 .

(S8)

Such a form provides the canonical decomposition of the reduced density matrix  = |0 0| + |1 1| over the

non-normalized states |0 , |1  H2N , obtained by tracing out the first qubit. Consider now a reversible operator

O=

ab cd

 SL(2, C) acting on the first qubit. Under the action of this operator, the state |

is transformed into

| := O | = |0 a |0 + b |1 + |1 c |0 + d |1 = |0 |0 + |1 |1 ,

(S9)

where

|0 := a |0 + b |1 , |1 := c |0 + d |1 .
Consider now any superposition of states |0 and |1 . Observe that

(S10) (S11)

|z := z |0 + |1 = z a |0 + b |1 + c |0 + d |1

= (az + b) |0 + (cz + d) |1 az + b
 cz + d |0 + |1 ,

where the compex number cz + d was factored out in order for the transformation to map states from the extended plane representation to the extended plane representation. In other words, we have

az + b

O |z = |z

,

z=

,

cz + d

(S12)

i.e. the operator O transforms states in the extended plane representation by applying a M¨obius tansformation on
the index z. Suppose now that i is a zero of a h-degree polynomial function E, i.e. E(i |0 + |1 ) = 0. Acting on the first qubit with O, the density matrix after tracing out the first qubit becomes |0 0| + |1 1|, so the entanglement measure E will be zero for some new roots i, such that E(i |0 + |1 ) = 0. Using Eqs. (S10)-(S11), the later equation can be transformed into

E

(ci + d)

ai ci

+ +

b d

|0

+ |1

=0

(S13)

where the factor (ci + d) is irrelevant since any root multiplied by it will still be a valid root. Comparing with the equation for the roots before the action of O, we reach the conclusion that the roots transform according to the inverse
Mo¨bius transformation as

i

=

di - b -ci + a

,

(S14)

under the action of the operator O. As a consequence, the roots of the zero-polytope transform with respect to the

inverse M¨obius transformation associated to the operator O =

ab cd

.

Analize now the case when O is a unitary

operator O = U. Since any unitary operator U can be represented as a rotation R =

cos sin ei -sin e-i cos

(up to an

irrelevant global phase), it will simply rotate the Bloch ball, together with the zero-polytope.

Consider now multilocal operators On = O1 . . .On acting on the remaining qubits of the state | from Eq. (S8). The state | will transform accordingly as

| := On | = |0 On |0 + |1 On |1 .

(S15)

:=|0

:=|1

After the action of On, a state in the extended plane representation will have a value of entanglement measure E equal to

E z |0 + |1 = E On z |0 + |1 .

3

However, since E is SL(2, C)n invariant, we have that E(z |0 + |1 ) = 0 iff E(z |0 + |1 ) = 0, and so the roots of both polynomial equations are the same. As a consequence, the roots of the the zero-polytope will remain
unchanged under the action of On. Finally, consider the family of non-normalized reduced density matrices  of rank 2 for which the entanglement
measure E is zero. Such density matrices will have to be constructed as a combination of the roots |i = i |0 +|1 of the polynomial E, i.e.

 = µi |i i | ,
i

(S16)

which spans the renormalized zero-polytope. As we presented in Supplemental Material Section 1, the center of the Bloch ball corresponds to the state  = 1/2 (|0 0| + |1 1|), associated to the state | = |0 |0 + |1 |1 after tracing out the first qubit. Therefore the entanglement measure vanishes on the reduced state E(|0 0|+|1 1|) = 0 iff the center of the Bloch ball is contained in the renormalized zero-polytope. This concludes the proof of Theorem 1.

SECTION 3. NORMAL FORM

Consider

the

It is very convinient to associate with

them the cuboid spanned by eight points:

,

as it is presented on Figure S1. Observe, that all six faces of the cuboid are parallel to one of the planes: XZ,XY , or Y Z. In fact, this property is equivalent to the initial assumption that the set of points  is in normal form. Clearly, all rotations of the Bloch ball preserve the form of the cuboid. Nevertheless, only a special subgroup of all rotations preserve faces of the cuboid being parallel to XZ,XY , or Y Z. This special subgroup G24 contains 24 elements spanned by three rotations of /2 around X, Y , and Z axis, given by:

Rx(/2) =

cos /4 -i sin /4 -i sin /4 cos /4

1 =
2

1 -i -i 1

,

Ry(/2) =

cos /4 -sin /4 sin /4 cos /4

,

Rz(/2) =

e-i/4 0 0 ei/4

1 =

1-i 0 0 1+i

(S17) (S18) (S19)

In fact, this is a group of rotations preserving the regular cube (the group of orientable cube symmetries). Clearly, all rotations in the G24 group preserve the normal-form structure of . On the other hand, the normal form is uniquelly determined up to 24 rotations in the G24 group.

Figure S1. A normal system of roots z, 1/z, -z, -1/z together with the conjugate points z¯, 1/z¯, -z¯, -1/z¯ span the cuboid

whose faces are parallel to the XZ, XY and Y Z planes. There are 24 rotations of the Bloch sphere which preserve this

property, composing the elements of the group G24. Two of them, namely the rotation by a /2 angle around X and Y axes

are presented.

The system of roots transforms according to Eqs. S17-S19, giving z  z

:=

z-i -iz+1

and z  z

:=

z-1 z+1

for

the

two rotations.

Proposition 2. Each non-degenerated four points z1, z2, z3, z4 on the Bloch sphere can be transformed onto the

normal

form

z,

1 z

,

-z,

-

1 z

via a M¨obius transformation T .

The latter is uniquely defined up to 24 rotations in the

group G24.

Proof. For each complex number  there exists another complex number z, such that the cross-ratio of the four points is equal to , i.e.

1

z, ; -z, - =  .

z

(S20)

Indeed, the cross-ratio on the left side equals 4z2/(1 + z2)2, and the equation 4z2/(1 + z2)2 =  has exactly four

solutions



4 - 2 + 1 -  1

z0 =

(S21)

Therefore, for a given value  there exists a unique -normal system, such that the cross-ratio of its vertices is given

by

(z0,

1 z0

;

-z0,

-

1 z0

)

=

.

Replacing the vertex z0 by any other vertex z0, 1/z0, -z0, or -1/z0 does not change

the

value

of

the

cross-ratio

(z0,

1 z0

;

-z0

,

-

)

=

.

Note that there exists a unique

M¨obius transformation T

which

maps z1, z2, z3 onto z0, 1/z0, -z0, with the remaining z4 mapped onto -1/z0. Observe as well that the value of z0

is unique up to its inverse, opposite and opposite inverse elements, according to Eq. (S21), with the corresponding

Mo¨bius transformations associated to the matrices T, xT, yT and zT . Each of those transformations maps the set

of points {z1, z2, z3, z4} onto the same set of points {z0, 1/z0, -z0, -1/z0}, although the exact bijection between those

two sets of roots is different for each transformation.

Depending on the order of four points {z1, z2, z3, z4}, the corresponding cross-ratio takes six values:

,

1 

,

1

-

,

1 1-

,

-1 

and

 -1

[S22].

For each

of

these,

there

is

a corresponding

set

of

solutions

of

the

form

{z0, 1/z0, -z0, -1/z0}

via Eq. (S21) with four related M¨obius transformations. Therefore, there are in total 24 M¨obius transformations that

map any four non-degenerated points onto a normal system, each of them related by an element of the group G24

which has exactly 24 elements.

SECTION 4. PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1

Consider the state |Gabcd and its decomposition with respect to the first subsystem |Gabcd = |0 |0 + |1 |1 , where

Suppose that  (3)( |0 + |1 ) = 0. Since  (3) is a SL(2, C)3 invariant, for any local operators O1, O2, O3 we have

 (3) (O1  O2  O3)  |0 + |1 = 0 .

Observe that

|0 =(x  x  x) |1 , |1 =(x  x  x) |1 ,

where x, y, z are Pauli matrices. Therefore by taking all local operators O1, O2, O3 equal to x, we may conclude that

0 =  (3) (x  x  x)  |0 + |1

1 =  |1 + |0   |0 + |1 ,

(S22)

hence 1/ is another root of  (3). Similarly, by considering (y  y  y) and (z  z  z), one may find another two roots -, -1/ of  (3). This shows that the roots of  (3) evaluated on any state from the Gabcd family are

5

symmetrical with respect to rotations around X, Y, Z axes by the angle . Writting  (3)(z |0 + |1 ) = 0 explicitely, we obtain the equation

 (3)(z |0 + |1 ) = Az4 - 2(2B + A)z2 + A = 0,

(S23)

where A = (b2 - c2)(a2 - d2) and B = (c2 - d2)(a2 - b2). The above equation is non-degenerated iff A, B, A + 2B = 0, which happens iff a2 = b2 = c2 = d2 are pairwise different.

Lemma 1. Any local operator O = O1  O2  O3  O4  SL(2, C)4 which transforms states |Ga b c d  O |Gabcd with a2 = b2 = c2 = d2, is of the form Oi  G24.

Proof. A local operator O1 acting on the first qubit and transforming the state |Gabcd onto |Ga b c d , also transforms their systems of roots denoted as  and  , respectively, via the action of the corresponding M¨obius transformation. Note that both systems  and  are in the normal form, therefore, according to Proposition 2, we have that Oi  G24. A similar analysis with respect to all other qubits shows that O2, O3, O4  G24.

This way, searching for SLOCC-equivalence between the states |Gabcd and |Ga b c d becomes restricted to the search within the finite class of operators O  G244. Since the group G24 has only 24 elements, one may numerically
verify that there are exactly 8 × 24 = 192 states in the Gabcd family which are SLOCC-equivalent to |Gabcd by O  G244. For example, the following operation









Rx 2  Rx 2  Rx 2  Rx 2

(S24)

transforms state |Gabcd into |G-b-acd . This might be simply written as a transformation of a tuples of indices: the tuple (a, b, c, d) is transformed into the tuple (-b, -a, c, b). Similarly, the operators showed on the following right hand sides provide the corresponding transformations of the tuple (a, b, c, d) on the left side:









Ry 2  Ry 2  Ry 2  Ry 2









Rz 2  Rz 2  Rz 2  Rz 2

 (a, d, c, b),  (-d, b, c, -a),

Ry()  Ry()  1  1  (a, -b, -c, d),

Rx()  Rx()  1  1  (a, b, -c, -d),

Ry()  1  Ry()  1  (d, c, b, a),

Rx()  1  Rx()  1  (b, a, d, c) .

Additionally, the tuples (a, b, c, d) and (-a, -b, -c, -d) represent the same state. Note that any composition of the

above operations also provides SLOCC equivalences between |Gabcd states. The eight aforementioned transformations

of tuples generate all permutations of the a, b, c, d indices, together with the change of a sign of any two or all four

indices.

There are exactly 24 permutations and for each permutation the signs can be matched in exactly 1+

4 2

+1 = 8

ways. This gives in total 192 tuples representing SLOCC equivalent states, which perfectly matches the numerical

result.

Finally, another trivial manipulation with indices a, b, c, d comes from multiplying by a global phase, which is an

irrelevant operation due the fact that quantum states are elements of a projective space. This operation transforms

the indices as

(eia, eib, eic, eid)  (a, b, c, d) ,

resulting in the same quantum state for any real number   [0, 2). In particular, for  = , we observe that system of opposite indices determines the same state as the initial one, i.e. (-a, -b, -c, -d)  (a, b, c, d).
