## Abstract

In the present note we focus on Lipschitz retractions of a separable Banach space $X$ onto its closed and convex generating subsets $K$. Our results are concerning the case when $K$ is in some quantitative sense small, namely when certain finite dimensional subspaces $E_n$ of $X$ are sufficiently close to the points of $K\setminus E_n$. Under such assumptions we obtain a near characterization of the $\pi$-property (resp. Finite Dimensional Decomposition property) of a separable Banach space $X$. In one direction, if $X$ admits the Finite Dimensional Decomposition (which is isomorphically equivalent to the metric-$\pi$-property) then we construct a Lipschitz retraction onto a (small) generating convex compact $K$. On the other hand, we prove that if $X$ admits a small (in a precise sense) generating compact Lipschitz retract then $X$ has the $\pi$-property. It seems to be an open problem whether the $\pi$-property is isomorphically equivalent to the metric-$\pi$-property (a positive answer would turn our results into a complete characterization). We also give an example of a small generating convex compact which is not a Lipschitz retract of $C[0,1]$, although it is contained in a small convex Lipschitz retract and contains another one. In the final part of our note we prove that a convex and compact set $K$ in any Banach space with a Uniformly Rotund in Every Direction norm is a uniform retract, of every bounded set containing it, via the nearest point map.
