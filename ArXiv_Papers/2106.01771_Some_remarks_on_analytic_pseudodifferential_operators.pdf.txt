SOME REMARKS ON ANALYTIC PSEUDODIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS1
Nenad Teofanov 2
Abstract
We report some recent results on analytic pseudodifferential operators, also known as Wick operators. An important tool in our study is the Bargmann transform which provides a coupling between the classical (real) and analytic pseudodifferential calculus. Since the Bargmann transform of Hermite functions gives rise to formal power series in the complex domain, the results are formulated in terms of the Bargmann images of Pilipovi´c spaces.

1 Introduction
We present a sample of recent results from [20, 21] related to Wick and antiWick operators introduced in 1960s by Berezin in the framework of the second quantization. Wick and anti-Wick symbols are used in [4] to derive various spectral properties of the corresponding operators. As demonstrated in [20, 21], results on Wick and anti-Wick operators provide new insight into the classical theory of pseudodifferential operators. This is done by using the mapping properties of the Bargmann transform given in [22, 23].
The Bargmann transform coupling between Hermite series expansions and formal power series expansions plays an important role in our analysis. For that reason, we first review some facts on Hermite functions and spaces of test functions (Pilipovi´c spaces) with Hermite coefficients of (super)exponential decay. Thereafter we briefly discuss the Bargmann transform, and finally we review some continuity properties of analytic pseudodifferential operators, and sharp G°arding inequality in the context of Wick and anti-Wick calculus.
Apart from motivations coming from quantum physics, Hermite polynomials are used e.g. in studying the propagation of light in infinitely long optical fibers with a parabolic index profile [9], in visual perception and neurobiology [25], and in equatorial oceanography [5]. For the applications of pseudodifferential operators in mobile wireless communication systems we refer to [18].

2 Hermite functions and Pilipovi´c spaces

We first consider Hermite functions within a historical context, and proceed with Pilipovi´c spaces given by Hermite series with rapidly decaying coefficients. Recall, Hermite functions are defined by

where  " p1, 2, . . . , nq P Nd, ! " 1! . . . d!, and H are (normalized) Hermite polynomials. The functions Hnpxq, x P R, n P N were introduced by P. S. Laplace in 1810, and later studied by P. L. Chebyshev (1859) and C. Hermite (1864). N. Wiener used Hermite function expansions to prove the Plancherel formula for the Fourier transform around 1930, [24]. In fact, Hermite functions are an orthonormal basis of L2pRq. Since Hermite functions are the wave functions for the stationary states of the quantum harmonic oscillator, they are particularly useful in quantum mechanics, [6].
B. Simon used Hermite function expansions in the framework of the space of rapidly decreasing functions SpRdq and its dual space of tempered distributions S1pRdq, [16]. Thereafter S. Pilipovi´c in [15] gave a characterization of GelfandShilov type spaces and their dual spaces of tempered ultradistributions through the growth estimates of coefficients in Hermite expansions, see also [11, 13] for more recent contributions in that direction. These investigations led to a detailed study of the so-called Pilipovi´c spaces, [1, 23].
Hermite series expansions are used in the following generalization of isotropic Gelfand-Shilov spaces SspRdq, s  1{2, (of Roumieu type) which consists of smooth functions f satisfying

|B f pxq| À h||!se´k|x|1{s ,

x P Rd,

for some h, k  0. We refer to [8, 10, 14, 19] for details on Gelfand-Shilov spaces and their applications in partial differential equations. As usual, Ss1 pRdq denotes the dual space of the Gelfand-Shilov space SspRdq, s  1{2.
Pilipovi´c spaces (of Roumieu type) HspRdq, s  0, are given through the
formal Hermite series expansions

for some r  0. When s  1{2 we have HspRdq " SspRdq, and H0pRdq is the set of all finite Hermite series expansions. It can be proved that HspRdq  SspRdq " t0u, 1{2  s  0.
In [23] J. Toft proved that

In addition, Toft considered Pilipovi´c flat spaces where the growth condition

some r  0. The well known relation between L2pRdq and the Fock space of analytic
functions A2pCdq (see Section 3 for the definition) can then be extended to the relation between Pilipovi´c spaces and specific subspaces of the space of ana-
lytic functions, [22]. This is done via the Bargmann transform, cf. Definition
3.1. Following this approach, a detailed study of analytic pseudodifferential
operators is given in [20, 21].

3 The Bargmann transform

Definition 3.1. The Bargmann transform Vdf of f P S11 {2pRdq is the entire function

It was proved by V. Bargmann in 1961. that

Vd : L2pRdq Ñ A2pCdq
is a bijective and isometric mapping from L2pRdq to the Fock space A2pCdq, the Hilbert space of entire functions with the scalar product


pF, GqA2 " F pzqGpzq dµpzq, F, G P A2pCdq,
Cd

where dµpzq " ´de´|z|2 dpzq (dpzq is the Lebesgue measure on Cd).

These investigations put a solid theoretical background for a quantization

procedure proposed by V. Fock back in 1930's. More precisely, Bargmann

showed

that

Vd

maps

the

creation

The Bargmann transform maps the Hermite functions to monomials as

The orthonormal basis thuPNd  L2pRdq is thus mapped to the orthonormal basis teuPNd  A2pCdq.

Then it is proved by Toft ([23]) that

Vd : HspRdq Ñ AspCdq, s  0,

is bijective mapping between Pilipovi´c spaces and corresponding spaces of analytic functions.

4 Analytic pseudodifferential operators

Definition 4.1. Let a be a locally bounded function on C2d such that pz, wq ÞÑ apz, wq is analytic, z, w P Cd. The analytic pseudodifferential operator or the Wick operator OpVpaq with the symbol a is given by
 OpVpaqF pzq " ´d apz, wqF pwqepz´w,wq dpwq,
Cd
where F is an entire function, d is the Lebesgue measure and p ¨ , ¨ q is the scalar product on Cd.

Thus pOpVpaqF qpzq is equal to the integral operator

when Kpz, wq " Kapz, wq " apz, wqepz,wq, and dµpwq " ´de´|w|2 dpwq. The (classical) pseudodifferential operator Oppbq with the symbol b is given
by the Kohn-Nirneberg correspondence

If b is a polynomial symbol, i.e.

then there is a unique symbol apz, wq " ÿ c2p, qzw

such that OpVpaq " Vd  Oppbq  V´d 1 (cf. [21]). Let AuspC2dq " t K ; pz, wq ÞÑ Kpz, wq P AspC2dq u, s  0, and
AupCd1`d2 q " Kpz, wq, z P Cd1 , w P Cd2 ; K is an analytic function ( .

Identification of linear and continuous mappings with pseudodifferential operators, and their basic continuity properties are given in Theorems 4.2 and 4.3. We refer to [20] for the proofs.

Let

Then

the

is

true:

1. If T is a linear and continuous map from A1spCdq to AspCdq, then there is a unique a P AupCd ^ Cdq such that

2. If T is a linear and continuous map from AspCdq to A1spCdq, then there is a unique a P AupCd ^ Cdq such that

for every r  0 and T " OpVpaq.

Theorem

4.3.

Let

s

1 2

.

Then

the

following

is

true:

1. If a P AupCd ^ Cdq satisfies

|apz,

À

¨|z ´w|2 ´rp|z |

1 s

q,

z, w P Cd,

for some r  0, then OpVpaq from A0pCdq to A10pCdq is uniquely extendable to a linear and continuous map from A1spCdq to AspCdq;

2. If a P AupCd ^ Cdq satisfies

|apz,

¨|z ´w|2 `rp|z |

1 s

q,

z, w P Cd,

for every r  0, then OpVpaq from A0pCdq to A10pCdq is uniquely extendable to a linear and continuous map from AspCdq to A1spCdq .
An important subclass of Wick operators are the anti-Wick operators, which are Wick operators where the symbol apz, wq does not depend on z:

 OpaVwpa0qF pzq " ´d a0pwqF pwqepz´w,wq dpwq.
Cd
The anti-Wick operators can also be described as the Bargmann images of Toeplitz operators on Rd. We refer to [12, 17, 22] for more details, and note that an important feature in energy estimates in quantum mechanics and time-frequency analysis is that non-negative symbols give rise to non-negative Toeplitz and anti-Wick operators.
In the next theorem we show that many Wick operators can essentially be expressed as linear combinations of anti-Wick operators. The expansion (4.1) is deduced by using Taylor expansion and integration by parts, see [21] for details.

We apply Theorem 4.4 to the sharp G°arding inequality for analytic pseudodifferential operators. Its real counterpart represents one of the basic applications of the Anti-Wick theory, [14]. According to G. Folland, G°arding's inequality is a milestone in the theory of elliptic equations, [7].

As a preparation, we introduce the Shubin class of symbols (cf. [17]). First

we introduce weight functions as follows. A weight on Rd is a positive function

 P L8locpRdq such bounded weight if

that 1{ P L8locpRdq. It there is another weight

is v´moderate for v of the form vpxq

a polynomially " xxys, s  0

(xxy

)

such

that

px ` yq À pxqvpyq, x, y P Rd.

By PSh,pRdq, 0    1, we denote the set of all smooth and v´moderate weights  for a polynomially bounded weight v such that

|Bpxq| À pxqxxy´||,  P Nd, x P Rd.

Let 0    1, and let  P PSh,pRdq. The Shubin symbol class ShpqpRdq is the set of all a P C8pRdq such that
|Bapxq| À pxqxxy´||, x P Rd,

for every multi-index  P Nd. Let AupShq,pC2dq, be the set of all a P AupC2dq such that

Let a0 P S11 {2pR2dq. Then the Bargmann assignment SVa0 of a0 is the unique element a P AupC2dq which fulfills

It can be proved that SV is a homeomorphism from ShpqpR2dq to AupShq,pC2dq, 0    1,  P PSh,pR2dq, see [21].
Finally, we have the following version of the sharp G°arding inequality.
Theorem 4.5. Let   0, pzq " xzy2 and let a0 P AupShq,pC2dq be such that a0pw, wq  ´C0 for all w P Cd, for some constant C0  0. Then

We refer to [21] for the proof.
