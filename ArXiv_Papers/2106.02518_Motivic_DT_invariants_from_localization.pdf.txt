Motivic DT invariants from localization

Pierre Descombes June 7, 2021

Abstract
Given a quiver with potential associated to a toric Calabi-Yau threefold, the numerical DonaldsonThomas invariants for the moduli space of framed representations can be computed by using toric localization, which reduces the problem to the enumeration of molten crystals. We provide a refinement of this localization procedure, which allows to compute motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants. Using this approach, we prove a universal formula which gives the BPS invariants of any toric quiver, up to undetermined contributions which are invariant under Poincar´e duality. When the toric Calabi-Yau threefold has compact divisors, these self-Poincar´e dual contributions have a complicated dependance on the stability parameters, but explicit computations suggest that they drastically simplify for the self-stability condition (also called attractor chamber). We conjecture a universal formula for the attractor invariants, which applies to any toric Calabi-Yau singularity with compact divisors.

1 Introduction

Donaldson-Thomas (DT) invariants are the mathematical counterpart of the BPS invariants counting supersymmetric bound states in type II string compactifications. On a non-compact toric Calabi-Yau threefold X, the study of DT invariants can be translated into a representation-theoretic problem using an equivalence between the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on X and the bounded derived category of representations of a quiver with potential (Q, W ), encoded in a brane tiling. The prime object of interest is the generating series of the motivic DT invariants A(x), or BPS monodromy, first defined in [1]. The refined BPS invariants ,d for dimension vector d  NQ0 and King stability parameter  can be extracted from A(x) by the formula:

A(x) = Exp

,d -L1/2 + L-1/2

xd

l

dl

(1.1)

where the product ranges over rays l with increasing slope. The attractor invariants ,d defined in [2] are special instances of ,d for  a small generic deformation of the self-stability (or attractor) condition ·, d , subject to the constraint (d) = 0. The attractor invariants correspond with initial data of the stability
scattering diagram introduced in [3], and one can extract from them all the DT invariants using the recently proven attractor and flow tree formula, see [4] and [5]. We denote by (x) := d ,dxd and (x) :=
d ,dxd the corresponding generating series. These series are in general hard to compute, and there is to our knowledge no general closed formula unless X has no compact divisors.

One way to compute these BPS invariants is to consider i-cyclic representations, i.e. representations with
a vector generating the whole representation at the node i. Equivalently, one considers DT invariants for the framed quiver with potential (Qi, W ) (with a single framing node  and a single framing arrow f :   i) in the non-commutative stability chamber. The generating series of motivic framed invariants Zi(x) is related to the generating series of unframed invariants A(x) by a wall crossing formula [6, 7],

Zi(x) = SiA(x)S-iA(x)-1

(1.2)

with S±ixd = (-L1/2)±di xd. For D a non-compact divisor of X, corresponding to a corner of the toric diagram, one can also consider D-cyclic representations, as defined in [8]. The corresponding framed quiver (QD, WD) has a single framing node  and a pair of arrows   i and j   with an additional potential term (see section 2.3.2 below for details). We denote by ZD(x) their motivic generating series. An i-cyclic (resp. D-cyclic) representation can be viewed as a noncommutative analogue of a sheaf with a map from the structure sheaf OX (resp. OD). In physics, framed DT invariants count framed BPS states with a D6-brane or non-compact D4-brane charge. Accordingly, we shall refer to the two types of framings as D6- and D4-brane
framing, respectively.

The moduli space of i-cyclic (resp. D cyclic) representations admits a maximal torus action rescaling the arrows of Qi (resp. Qf ), leaving the potential W (resp. WD) equivariant, i.e. invariant up to a scalar: we denote by i (resp. D) the character lattic of the torus. We further denote by i (resp. D) the subset of i (resp. D) (called the Empty Room Configuration, or ERC) given by weights of paths starting at the framing node in Qi (resp. QD): i can be interpreted a pyramid with an atom of type i on the top, whose facets are given by D, for D running over the corners of the toric diagram.
In lemma 3.6 we show that the i-cyclic (respectively, D-cyclic) representations which are fixed under the maximal torus leaving the potential invariant are in bijection with the set i of subpyramids of i (respectively, the set D of subfacets of D). This allows to translate the computation of the numerical limit of the generating series Zi(x) (resp. ZD(x)) into a purely combinatorial problem, as proven in [9]. The formalism of K-theoretic localization, developed in [10] allows to compute a refinement of the numerical Donaldson-Thomas invariants, known as the K-theoretic DT invariants (which are expected to agree with the y genus evaluation of the motivic DT invariants), provided the moduli space of framed representations is compact. This formalism therefore applies when the ERC is finite (see for example in [11]). In our situation, the moduli space is non-compact, and the generating functions of K-theoretic and motivic invariants differ, as can be seen by comparing the computations for the Hilbert scheme of points on C3 in the K-theoretic setting in [10], and in the motivic setting in [12] (see remark 3.2).

Recall that for a one dimensional torus C acting on a smooth scheme, the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition allows to express the cohomology of the attracting variety, i.e. the subvariety of points flowing onto a fixed

2

point when t  0, as a sum of the cohomology of the fixed points components, shifted by the number of contracting weights in the C-equivariant tangent space of the fixed locus. The moduli space of cyclic
representations of a framed quiver with potential (Qf , Wf ) is not smooth: it is the critical locus of the functional Tr(Wf ), but the general philosophy of derived geometry allows to think about it as a smooth scheme, provided that one replaces the tangent space by the full tangent-obstruction complex (3.16).

We consider the maximal torus T scaling the arrows by leaving the potential invariant: the tautological

sheaves Vi have a T -equivariant structure on the T -fixed locus, giving a cocharacter   f , denoting by f the set of cocharacters and by d the dimension vector of a cocharacter. We denote by [MTQf ,Wf ,]vir the virtual motive of the component with cocharacter  of the T -fixed locus, and by Tvir the T -equivariant
tangent obstruction complex on this component. For a fixed dimension vector d, we choose a generic slope

s, i.e. a For such

one dimensional torus Ts  a choice, we denote by Indexs

T such that the number

fixed points of Ts on MQf ,Wf ,d are fixed (counted with signs) of attractor weights in

points of Tvir, and

T. by

[MQAsf ,Wf ,d]vir the virtual motive of the attracting variety. A slope can be generic only for bounded dimensions

vectors, so in order to compute generating series by localization one must choose a family s¯ = (sd)d of slopes

indexed by dimension vectors such that sd is generic for d. For a family s¯ = (sd)d of generic slopes, we define ZfAs¯(x) := d[MAQsfd,Wf ,d]virxd the generating series of those virtual motives. We shall prove a derived version of the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition for general framed quiver with potential:

Theorem 1.1. (Theorem 3.3)

For a family of generic slopes s¯ = (sd)d, one can compute by localization the generating series ZfAs¯(x) of the

virtual

the

attracting

varieties

MAsd
Qf ,Wf

,d:

ZfAs¯(x) =

(-L1/2)Indexsd [MTQf ,Wf , ]vir xd

f

(1.3)

We apply this result to D6 and D4 brane framings. A choice of slope is then equivalent to a choice of a generic quotient (s|L) : L  Z, separating the lattice L dual to the brane tiling lattice, into two half planes L+ = (s|L)-1(N) and L- = (s|L)-1(-N), corresponding to contracting (resp. repelling) weights in the t  0 limit. To a side z of the toric diagram one associates a vector lz  L, given by the outward normal to one subdivision of this side, which corresponds to the L-weight of a particular cycle of (Q, W ) denoted by viz : i  i for i  Q0. Those cycles generate all the cycles of (Q, W ) (precisely, for w a cycle of Q, one has a power n  N such that wn can be written as a product of viz), and correspond to the toric coordinates on X when one views the path algebra of (Q, W ) as a noncommutative crepant resolution of the coordinate ring of X. Applying theorem 3.3 to the framed quivers (Qi, W ) and (QD, WD), we obtain:
Theorem 1.2. (Theorem 3.8)

· For D a non-compact divisor of X, corresponding to the corner p of the toric diagram lying between the two sides z, z, and a family generic slopes s¯ = (sd)d such that lz, lz  L+ (such slopes always exist,
because the angle between lz and lz is smaller than ), we have:

ZD(x) =

(-L1/2)Indexsd xd

D

(1.4)

· For a family of generic slopes s¯ = (sd)d such that lz~  L-  z~  [z, z], we have:

Zi[z,z]:N (x) =

(-L1/2)Indexsd xd

i

(1.5)

Imposing nilpotency and invertibility of various cycles of Q amounts to restricting to a Serre subcategory of the category of critical representations of the quiver. Consequently, the formalism of cohomological Hall algebra and wall crossing still applies. For two disjoint sets of sides of the toric diagram ZI and ZN , we denote by ZiZI:I,ZN :N , AZI :I,ZN :N (x), Z I :I,ZN :N (x), Z I:I,ZN :N (x) the generating series of motivic DT invariants for the moduli substack or subschemes of representations such that for z  ZI (resp. z  ZN ), vjz is invertible (resp. nilpotent) for all j  Q0. We shall show the following decomposition for the partially invertible BPS invariants of unframed representations:

3

Proposition 1.3. (Proposition 4.3)

i) For ZI , ZN and ZI = , BPS invariants are not subject to wall crossing, and we denote them by ZI :I,ZN :N (x), omitting the subscript .
ii) For ZI, ZN and z  ZI  ZN , we have: Z I :I,ZN :N (x) = ZI :I,ZN ,z:I (x) + ZI :I,ZN :N,z:N (x)

(1.6)

The partially invertible BPS invariants are simple to compute: we provide a universal formula for them in propositions 4.4 and 4.5. We can then express the full BPS invariants (x) from the partially nilpotent ones [z,z]:N (x) which can be obtained by localization. To a side z of the toric diagram with Kz subdivisions, one associates zig-zag paths, special paths on the brane tiling dividing the torus into Kz parallel strips: for k = k  Z/KzZ, we denote by zk the dimension vector with 1 on nodes of Q inside the k-th strip of the torus, z[kk[ = zk + zk+1 + ... + zk-1, and  the dimension vector with 1 on each node. We obtain a localization formula for 'D6-brane' framed invariants:

Theorem 1.4. (Theorem 4.7) For a family of generic slopes s¯ = (sd)d such that lz~  L-  z~  [z, z], defining:

s¯(x) =

s¯dxd := (x) - [z,z](x)

d

(1.7)

One has:

s¯(x) =(-L3/2 - ( z~[z,z]Kz~ - 2)L1/2 + ( z~[z,z]Kz~ - 1)L-1/2)

(1.8)

This localization formula can be easily implemented on a computer to calculate the motivic DT invariants explicitly for any brane tiling and reasonably small dimension vectors.

As an application of our refined localization techniques, we obtain a general result for BPS invariants for any brane tiling and dimension vector, obtained by relating the localization formula for a one dimensional torus and its dual:

Theorem 1.5. (Theorem 4.8)

(x) = (-L3/2 - (b - 3 + i)L1/2 - iL-1/2) xn - L1/2

xn+z[kk[ + sym(x)

n1

z k=k n0

(1.9)

with sym(x) self Poincar´e dual, and supported on dimension vectors d   . In particular, one has:

(x) = (-L3/2 - (b - 3 + i)L1/2 - iL-1/2) xn - L1/2

xn+z[kk[ + sym(x)

n1

z k=k n0

(1.10)

with sym(x) self Poincar´e dual, and supported on dimension vectors d  

For toric CY threefolds without compact divisors (also known as local curves, corresponding to toric diagrams with no internal points), the quiver Q is symmetric, and consequently the unframed DT invariants do not exhibit wall-crossing. They are known in most cases, see [12, 13, 14] and [2, §5] for a review. We check that (4.8) is consistent with these results: in such cases, including the simplest case of the conifold, there exists infinite towers of dimension vectors d with (d) = 1, associated to rational curves with normal bundle O(-1) + O(-1), whose contributions are included in sym(x). In contrast, the dimension vectors with (d) = -L1/2 appearing in (4.8) are associated to rational curves with normal bundle O(-2) + O(0). In some cases one can find 'preferred slopes' (as shown in [15]) where many cancellations occur in the index, and

4

obtain a closed formula for the full BPS invariants from the refined localization: we check that it agrees with the results of [12] for X = C3 in (4.58).

For CY threefolds with compact divisors, corresponding to asymmetric quivers, there is no closed formula to our knowledge for unrefined invariants, let alone in the refined case. In particular BPS invariants depend on the King stability parameter , and the symmetric contribution sym(x) is quite intricate for arbitrary . According to the conjectures of [16, 2], the attractor invariants must be very simple. In particular, they are conjecturally supported on dimension vectors ei for i  Q0, corresponding to simple representations, and on dimension vectors lying in the kernel of the antisymmetrized Euler form. We shall formulate a refinement of these conjectures:

Conjecture 1.6. (Conjecture 4.9) For toric diagram with i  1 internal lattice points, the attractor invariants are given by:

(x) = xi + (-L3/2 - (b - 3 + i)L1/2 - iL-1/2) xn - L1/2

xn+z[kk [

i

n1

z k=k n0

(1.11)

When the singularity is isolated, i.e. when there are no lattice points on the boundary of the toric diagram, the only nontrivial attractor invariants are then expected to correspond to skyscraper sheaves on X. In contrast, when there are Kz - 1 lattice points on a side z of the toric diagram, the toric threefold X exhibits a C2/ZKz × C singularity away from the zero locus of the toric coordinate corresponding to z, as recalled in the proof of proposition 4.5. The conjecture then predicts that the only additional attractor invariants correspond to D2-branes wrapped on rational curves in this extended singularity.
The rest of this article is organized as follows:

· In section 2 we review known results on Donaldson-Thomas theory on toric threefolds, and introduce the basic definitions and notations. In section 2.1, we introduce the moduli spaces of representations associated to unframed and framed quiver, their virtual motives and generating series thereof. In section 2.2 we recall how the quiver with potential for toric CY threefolds can be deduced a from brane tiling, and emphasize the utility of zig-zag paths. In section 2.3 we introduce the D6- and D4-framing. In section 2.4 we introduce the notion of partially invertible/nilpotent representations, and define their generating series and BPS invariants.
· In section 3, we study toric localization for framed quivers. While we are mostly interested in the D4and D6-framings for toric threefolds in this article, we have kept the discussion as general as possible, with a view towards future applications. In section 3.1 we describe the fixed locus and the attracting locus of the toric action. In section 3.2, we recall the definition of the tangent obstruction complex, a derived version of the tangent space to the fixed points, and recall the method of K-theoretic localization. In section 3.3, we prove the 'derived Bialynicki-Birula decomposition' for general framed quivers. In section 3.4, we apply this general formalism to D6- and D4 brane framings.
· In section 4, using invertible/nilpotent decompositions of unframed representations, we relate generating functions of BPS invariants with various nilpotency constraints. In section 4.1 we show that the invertible/nilpotent decomposition on unframed representations implies a factorization of generating series, and a decomposition of BPS invariants. In section 4.2, we compute BPS invariants for partially invertible representations. In section 4.3 we orchestrate previous results, express the BPS invariants in terms of the partially nilpotent BPS invariants accessible by toric localization, and prove the formula 4.8. In section 4.4 we illustrate our formula and formulate our conjecture for the complete set of attractor invariants, first by comparing with the known formulas for local curves, and by comparing with the computations in [16, 2]. In order to facilitate comparison with future computations, we spell out our conjecture for the canonical bundle over toric weak Fano surfaces, using the brane tilings listed in [17].

2 Basic notions on Donaldson-Thomas theory and toric quivers
In this section, we review known results on Donaldson-Thomas theory on toric threefolds, and introduce the basic definitions and notations.

2.1 Invariants of quivers with potential

2.1.1 representations and virtual motives

Consider a quiver with potential (Q, W ), with Q0 (resp. Q1) the set of nodes (resp. arrows) of Q, the source and target of an arrow a being denoted respectively s(a) and t(a), and W a linear combination of cycles of Q
(we follow the notations of [9] whenever possible). The path algebra of the quiver Q, denoted by CQ, is the free algebra generated by arrows of the quiver, such that ba = 0 if s(b)  t(a). A cycle is a path w = a1...an with s(an) = t(a1). The cyclic derivative is defined by

aw =

ai+1...ana1...ai-1

i:ai =a

(2.1)

and extended to CQ by linearity. The cyclic derivatives of the potential define the ideal (W ) = ((aW )aQ1 ). The Jacobian algebra is the quotient J = CQ/(W ). We shall usually identify a path with its image in J,
i.e. paths which differ by derivatives of the potential will be identified.

Consider a framed quiver with potential (Qf , Wf ) obtained from (Q, W ) by adding a single framing node , (possibly multiple) framing arrows between the framing node and nodes of Q, and (when allowed)
additional cycles in the potential, corresponding to path starting and ending at the framing node. One
consider the projective CQf module Pf generated by paths of Qf starting at the framing node. One can also consider the Jacobian algebra Jf := CQf /(Wf ) and the left Jf module Pf := Pf /((Wf )  Pf ). One defines similarly the vector space Pf,i of paths of Qf with source at the framing node and target at i  Q0, and Pf,i := Pf,i/((Wf )  Pf,i) the space of those paths considered up to potential derivatives.

For any dimension vector d  NQ0 , we denote by MQ,d the moduli stack of d-dimensional representations of the unframed quiver Q (without imposing the potential relations), i.e. the moduli stack of left CQ modules, which can be expressed more explicitly by:

Here the gauge group Gd =

MQ,d =

(a:ij)Q1 Hom(Cdi , Cdj ) iQ0 Gldi

iQ0 Gldi acts on a  Hom(Cdi , Cdj ) by a  gj agi-1.

(2.2)

Similarly, for any dimension vector d  NQ0 we denote by MQf ,d the moduli space of f -cyclic representations of the framed quiver Qf with dimension vector d = (d, 1)  NQ0 f , i.e. representations with dimension 1 on the framing node, such that the subrepresentation generated by the framing node is the whole
representation:

( MQf ,d =

(a:ij)(Qf )1 Hom(Cdi , Cdj ))cycl iQ0 Gldi

(2.3)

Here the subscript cycl denote the open subset of f -cyclic representations. The action of the gauge group
Gd is free on this open subset, i.e. MQf ,d is a scheme. Equivalently, MQf ,d is the scheme corresponds to d-dimensional quotients of the module of paths Pf , i.e. quotient by a CQf submodule  = iQ0 i, with i  Pf,i of codimension di.

One can consider the functional Tr(W ) on MQ,d (resp. T r(Wf ) on MQf ,d), and its critical locus MQ,W,d (resp. MQf ,Wf ,d). Representations in the critical locus are called critical representations, and correspond to left J modules (resp. quotients of Pf ). One denotes by W (resp. Wf ) the vanishing cycle functor of T r(W ) (resp. Tr(Wf )), having support on critical representations: it is a functor with source the category of mixed
Hodge modules on MQ,d (resp. on MQf ,d), and target the category of monodromic mixed Hodge modules on MQ,d (resp. on MQf ,d) with support on MQ,W,d (resp. MQf ,Wf ,d).

6

Consider a constructible substack MBQ,d of MQ,d (resp. a constructible subscheme MBQf ,d of MQf ,d), and denote by  (resp. f the embedding of this substack (resp. subscheme) into MQ,d (resp. MQf ,d), MBQ,W,d := MBQ,d  MQ,W,d (resp MBQf ,Wf ,d := MBQf ,d  MQf ,Wf ,d) and by pM (resp. pM) the projection of a stack M (res of a scheme M) onto a point. In this work we shall consider substacks or subschemes that are
attracting varieties of a toric action, or giving representations with nilpotency and invertibility constraints on
particular cycles. Following the general formalism of cohomological Donaldson-Thomas invariants developed in
[1],[18], one can define the virtual motives of critical representations in the Grothendieck group of monodromic mixed Hodge structures [MBQ,W,d]vir (resp. [MBQf ,Wf ,d]vir):

[MBQ,W,d]vir =(-L1/2)- dim(MQ,d)Hc·(MBQ,d, W QMQ,d ) =(-L1/2)- dim(MQ,d)D(pMB Q,d )!W (pMQ,d )Q =(-L1/2)- dim(MQ,d)(pMB Q,d )!W (pMQ,d )!Q
[MBQf ,Wf ,d]vir =(-L1/2)- dim(MQf ,d)Hc·(MBQf ,d, Wf QMQf ,d ) =(-L1/2)- dim(MQf ,d)D(pMB Qf ,d )!(f )Wf (pMQf ,d )Q =(-L1/2)- dim(MQf ,d)(pMB Qf ,d )(f )!Wf (pMQf ,d )!Q

(2.4)

denoting by Hc·(M, F ) the Grothendieck class of the dual of the cohomology with compact support of the complex of sheaf F on M , QM = pQ the constant mixed Hodge module on M , obtained by the pullback of the constant mixed Hodge module Q on a point, and by D Verdier's duality functor.

2.1.2 Quantum affine space and generating series

For d, d  ZQ0 , the Euler form Q and its antisymmetrized version , are defined by:

Q(d, d) =

didi -

didj

iQ0

(a:ij)Q1

d, d = Q(d, d) - Q(d, d)

(2.5)

The quantum affine space A^ is the algebra generated by elements xd, for d  NQ0, with coefficients in the Grothendieck group (having a ring structure) of monodromic mixed Hodge structures, and relations:

xdxd = (-L1/2) d,d xd+d

(2.6)

The generating functions of unframed or framed invariants (possibly restricted to a substack or subscheme), with values in the quantum affine space A^ , are defined by:

AB(x) = [MBQ,W,d]vir xd
d
ZfB(x) = [MBQf ,Wf ,d]vir xd
d

(2.7)

We introduce the involution S±i and the anti-involution  of the quantum affine space A^ (denoting P a class of the Grothendieck group of monodromic mixed Hodge structure):

S±i : P xd  (-L1/2)±di P xd  : P xd  D(P )xd

(2.8)

i.e.  implements the Poincar´e duality D at the level of monodromic mixed Hodge structures: notably L1/2 = L-1/2. They satisfy:

S±i(AB) = S±iAS±iB S±i(A-1) = (S±iA)-1 (AB) = (B)(A) (A-1) = (A)-1   S±i = Si  

(2.9)

2.1.3 Toric action on paths

We consider the torus (C)(Qf )1 acting on CQf , and therefore also on Pf , by scaling the arrows of Qf . We consider now a subtorus T  (C)(Qf )1, whose character lattice is denoted by LT (each arrow a and path v having a weight wt(a), wt(v)  LT ), such that each cycle of the potential Wf has the same weight denoted by : we say then that this torus leaves the potential equivariant. Because the potential is equivariant, derivatives
of the potential are homogeneous and then Jf possesses an LT -grading as an algebra, and Pf possesses an LT -grading as an Jf -module, i.e.

a.(Pf )  (Pf )+wt(a) , for   LT

(2.10)

The torus T acts on the moduli space MQf ,d of quotients of Pf , and this action retricts to an action on MQf ,Wf ,d, the moduli space of quotients of Pf . We will see that we can localize the computation of Donaldson-Thomas invariants only when moreover T leaves the potential invariant, i.e. when  = 0.

The gauge torus TG = (C)Q0 acts on (C)(Qf )1 by adjunction (ta)(a:ij)(Qf )1  (titat-j 1)(a:ij)(Qf )1 , where we denote t = 1. Considering a torus T scaling the arrows leaving the potential equivariant, the action of T on MQf ,d and MQf ,Wf ,d descends to an action of T /TG.
We denote by f the weight lattice of the maximal torus scaling the arrows of Qf by leaving the potential equivariant. Its quotient f /Z is then the weight lattice of the subtorus leaving the potential invariant. We make the following assumptions, which will be satisfied for D6 and D4 brane framings of toric quivers (lemma 3.6):
Assumption 2.1. i) The f weight of any nontrivial cycle in CQf which acts nontrivially on Pf is not zero.
ii) The graded components (Pf,i) for   f , i  Q0 are at most one dimensional
iii) Any f /Z-homogeneous submodule of Pf is also f -homogeneous.

Under these assumptions, one defines the Empty Room (ERC) Configuration f as the subset of f × Q0 given by pairs (, i) such that (Pf,i) is not empty (and then one dimensional from ii)). One calls the elements of f  (f × {i}) the atoms of color i of the ERC. One denotes (, i)  (µ, j) for , µ  f if there exist (v : i  j)  CQf such that w.(Pf,i) = (Pf,i)µ. The relation  is manifestly reflexive and transitive. If (, i)  (µ, j)  (, i), then there are paths (v : i  j), (w : j  i)  CQf such that (Pf,i) = w(Pf,j )µ = wv(Pf,i), i.e. wv has f weight 0, then wv : i  i is trivial in CQf from the assumption i), and then w : j  i is trivial in CQf , giving (, i) = (µ, j):  is then antisymmetric. Thus  defines a poset structure on f .

We denote by f the set of finite ideals of f , i.e. subsets   f such that x  y, y    x  . For   f we denote by d  NQ0 the dimension vector such that (d)i gives the number of atoms of color i in .
Lemma 2.2. Under assumption 2.1, f /Z-homogeneous submodule of Pf with codimension (1, d) are in bijections with elements   f such that d = d

Proof: Because the f -graded components of Pf are assumed to be at most one dimensional, a f homogeneous submodule  with codimension (1, d) of Pf is then a sum of graded components of Pf :

 = (Pf,) 

(Pf,i)

=0

(i,)

(2.11)

The condition that  is a submodule is equivalent, by construction of the poset structure on f , to the condition that  is an ideal of f , and we have d = d. There is then a natural bijection between the set of f -homogeneous submodule of Pf (which by iii) in the assumption is equal to the set of f /Z-homogeneous submodule of Pf ) and f .

2.2 Unframed quivers associated to toric threefolds
2.2.1 From toric diagrams to quivers with potentials
Let us consider a toric Calabi Yau threefold X. The fast inverse algorithm described in [19] gives a brane tiling on the two- dimensional torus from the toric diagram of X (in fact, it can gives different brane tilings

8

that are related by toric mutations).

We consider the toric diagram of X, which is a convex polygon in a two dimensional free lattice L. We

denote by n the number of corners of the toric diagram, and the corners themselves by pi for i  Z/nZ in the clockwise order. The side of the toric diagram between two adjacent corners pi and pi+1 will be denoted zi+1/2. We denote by Kz the number of subdivisions of the edge z, i.e. the lattice points on that edge (counting the endpoints) minus one. We denote by lz  L the primitive vector generating the dual of the side z in L. If one has chosen an orthogonal structure on the toric diagram lattice, lz is then the primitive vector generating the outward normal halfline to the edge. As an example, for C3, the toric diagram and vectors lz are given by:

p1

lz3/2

lz1/2

p0

p2

lz5/2
Let us now describe the fast inverse algorithm. On the real two dimensional torus obtained by dividing R2 by the lattice L, we draw for each edge z of the toric diagram Kz generic oriented lines directed along lz, in generic position such that two lines intersect only in one point and three lines do not intersect. The different choices in the relative arrangement of lines will correspond to different quivers with potential related by toric mutations. The complement of these lines determines polygonal domains, or tiles, with oriented edges. We color those tiles in white, dark grey or light grey, according to the orientations of their edges:

· If the edges of the tile are oriented in the clockwise order around the tile, we color the tile in dark grey
· if the edges of the tile are oriented in the counter-clockwise order around the tile, we color the tile in light grey
· if the orientations of the different edges of the tile do not agree, we color the tile in white

We define a brane tiling on the torus by putting a black node in each dark grey tile, a white node in each light grey tile, and connecting a black node and a white node if the corresponding tiles are connected at one of their corners. The white tiles are then in correspondence with tiles of the brane tiling.

Definition 2.3. The quiver with potential (Q, W ) associated to a brane tiling is defined as the dual of this brane tiling, i.e. :

· The set of nodes Q0 of the quiver is the set of tiles of the brane tiling
· The set of arrows Q1 of the quiver is the set of edges of the brane tiling. An edge of the tiling between two tiles gives an arrow of the quiver between the two corresponding nodes, oriented such the black node is at the left of the arrow
· Denote by Q2 the set of nodes of the brane tiling, and Q+2 (resp. Q-2 ) the subset of white (resp. black) nodes. To a node F  Q2 one associate the cycle wF of Q composed by arrows surrounding this node. One define:

W=

wF -

wF

F Q+ 2

F Q- 2

(2.12)

By definition, the quiver with potential (Q, W ) is drawn on a torus: the unfolding of this quiver to the universal cover R2 of the torus is called the periodic quiver.

Example 2.4 (C3). In the case of C3, this procedure gives:

9

a

1

c

b W = abc - acb

Definition 2.5. A zig-zag path directed by lz is the set of edges interesecting one of the Kz lines with direction lz: they form a sequence of edges which turns alternatively maximally right or maximally left in the diagram, following this general picture:
strip k
strip k + 1

The Kz lines with direction lz divide the torus into Kz strips, which we can label by k  Z/KzZ. The
cyclic ordering is given by the orientation in the picture, i.e. the k-th strip lies to the left of the zig-zag path
and the k + 1-th strip lies to the right. We call Zigk (resp. Zagk) the set of arrows crossing the zig-zag path, going from the k-th strip to the k + 1-th strip (resp. from k + 1-th strip to the k-th strip). We denote by zk the dimension vector with component 1 on the nodes inside the k-th strip, and 0 on the other nodes. We further define

z[kk[ = zk + zk+1 + ... + zk-1

(2.13)

remembering that the index k lives in Z/KzZ. In particular, z[k,k[ =  is the dimension vector with entries 1 on each node of Q0, associated to points on X.

2.2.2 Perfect matchings and lattices of paths

Following [20], consider the complex of abelian groups:

ZQ2 d2 ZQ1 d1 ZQ0

(2.14)

such that d2(F ) = aF a and d1(a) = t(a) - s(a). One defines:

 = ZQ1 / d2(F ) - d2(G)|F, G  Q2

(2.15)

and denote by  the image of d2(F ) for F  Q2 in . The lattice  (resp. its quotient /Z = ZQ1 /d2(ZQ2 )) is then the character lattice of the maximal torus scaling the arrows of Q by leaving the potential W equivariant (resp. invariant), and  is the  weight of the potential. According to proposition 4.8 of [9], two paths with the same source agree in J if and only if they have the same -weight.

The map d1 descends to a map d :   ZQ0 , and one defines M = ker(d): M (resp. M/Z) is the sublattice of  (resp. /Z) giving the weights of cycles of Q, i.e. M (resp. M/Z) gives the weight lattice of the quotient of the maximal torus leaving the potential equivariant (resp. invariant) by the gauge torus TG.

Definition 2.6. A perfect matching is a subset I of the edges of the brane tiling such that each node of the brane tiling is adjacent to exactly one edge of I. By duality, a perfect matching is equivalent to a cut I of the quiver with potential (Q, W ), i.e. a subset of Q1 such that each cycle wF of the potential W contains exactly one arrow of I.

One defines the linear map I : ZQ1  Z sending a  Q1 to 1 if a  I and 0 either. Since I (d2(F )) = 1 for F  Q2 by definition of a perfect matching, I descends to a map I :   Z such that I () = 1, and restricts to ¯I  M . Let  MQ be the cone generated by the ¯I . According to [20, Remark 4.16],  gives

10

then the fan of X, and the intersection of  with the hyperplane {f  MQ|f () = 1} gives the toric diagram of X: in particular, the lattice L of the toric diagram is identified with (M/Z). The lattice L of the brane tiling torus can then be identified as L = M/Z.

As was first noticed in [19], ¯I gives a node of the toric diagram: the map sending a perfect matching to the corresponding node of the toric diagram is surjective but not injective in general. However, there is a unique perfect matching associated to any corner of the toric diagram. We shall consider only such perfect matchings, and denote by Ii the cut associated to the corner pi.
The union of two perfect matchings draws paths on the brane tiling which are also called zig-zag paths. When the two matchings correspond to two adjacent corners pi and pi+1 that are endpoints of the same side z = zi+1/2, these zig-zag paths correspond to the above defined zig-zag paths with direction lz  L. Removing the arrows of the two cuts Ii, Ii+1, one obtains a quiver which is a union of connected parts supported on the Kz strip separated by the zig-zag paths: we denote by Qk the quiver supported on the k-th strip. We can then distinguish four types of arrows:

· Arrows that are not in any cuts Ii, Ii+1 are the arrows of one connected part Qk of the remaining quiver for a k  Z/KzZ.
· Arrows that are in the intersection of the two cuts lie outside the zig-zag paths, i.e. they connect nodes inside the same connected component Qk, for a k  Z/KzZ; we denote the set of those arrows by Jk.
· Arrows in Ii - Ii+1 lie inside zig zag paths. With our conventions, they go from Qk to Qk+1, for a k  Z/KzZ, i.e. they forms to the above defined set Zigk
· Arrows in Ii+1-Ii are in zig zag paths. With our conventions, they go from Qk+1 to Qk for a k  Z/KzZ; i.e. they forms the above defined set Zagk.

Let us denote by M +  M the semigroup generated by weights of cycles of Q. According to [20], corollaries 3.3 and 3.6, MQ+ is a cone which is the dual cone of , and M + is saturated, i.e. :

M + = {  M |I ()  0  I}

(2.16)

We denote by C[M +] the ring generated by elements e for   M +, with relations e+ = ee. Because  is the fan of X, on has then X = Spec(C[M +]). By associating to e  C[M +] the sum over i  Q0 of the cycles of weight  with source and target i (recall that two paths of Q agree in J if they have the same source and -weight), one obtains an inclusion C[M +]  J. It was then proven in [21] that C[M +] is the center of
J. According to [20], proposition 3.13, J provides then a noncommutative resolution of the coordinate ring
of X.

The edges of the cone MQ+ =  are dual to sides of the toric diagram. Consider a side zi+1/2 between the

corners

pi

and

pi+1:

i.e.

is

generated

by cycles of Q without arrows of Ii  Ii+1. It shows that all the indecomposable cycles of the quivers Qk have

the same M -weight (and equivalently the same  weight) denoted by z. In particular, by construction, the

projection of z onto L = M/Z is lz. We can then define viz  J, for i  (Qk)0 as the indecomposable cycle of Qk with source and target i, i.e. ez corresponds to iQ0 viz lying in the center of J . We have then the commutation relation, for any path (w : i  j)  J

wviz = vjz w

(2.17)

2.2.3 Examples We illustrate our notations on several examples: Example 2.7 (P dP3a). The toric diagram and brane tiling are given by:

2.3 Framed quivers associated to toric threefolds

2.3.1 D6-brane framing

We introduce a first type of framed quiver built from an unframed quiver (Q, W ) coming from a brane tiling.
Choosing i  Q0 a node of the quiver, we consider the framed quiver Qi with a framing node  (which is ungauged), and an arrow q :   i, i.e. ((Qi)0, (Qi)1) = (Q0  {}, Q1  {q}). The potential is still W , because there is no cycle passing by the framing node. We will consider i-cyclic representations, i.e.
representations V of the framed quiver Qi such that d = 1, and the subrepresentation generated by V is the whole representation. We denote by Zi(x) the generating series of the virtual motives [MQi,W,d]vir of i-cyclic critical representations, following the definitions in (2.4) and (2.7).

Remark 2.9. Such a framing corresponds to adding a D6-brane in physic terminology. Framed i-cyclic representations are a noncommutative analogue of sheaves with compact support on X with a framing by the sheaf OX : such a complex is then considered as a bound state of a D6 noncompact brane (i.e. a sheaf with support on the whole noncompact threefold X) with a D4-D2-D0 compact brane (i.e. a sheaf with compact support on 2 dimensional, 1 dimensional and 0 dimensional subvarieties).

There is a general formula, which is a variant of the wall crossing formula of [1], expressing the framed generating series Zi(x) in terms of the generating series A(x) of representations of the unframed quiver (Q, W ), developed in [6],[7] and [13]:

Zi(x) = SiA(x)  S-iA(x)-1

(2.21)

2.3.2 D4-brane framing
We consider a cut I corresponding to a corner pi of the toric diagram, denoting D the corresponding divisor. The divisor D is in particular noncompact. We now introduce, following [8], a framed quiver with potential (QD, WD), such that D-cyclic representations are a noncommutative analogue of sheaves with compact support on X with a framing by the sheaf OD. In physic terminology, such framed sheaves correspond to bound states of a noncompact D4 brane wrapped on D, together with compact D4-D2-D0 branes.
The corner pi lies between the two sides z = zi-1/2 and z = zi+1/2, with Kz and Kz subdivisions, respectively. We can then choose one of the intersection points of the Kz, Kz oriented lines on the torus with direction lz, lz (according to [8, §4.4], different intersection points correspond to different choices for the holonomy of the gauge fields at infinity). Following the general procedure of the fast inverse algorithm, the picture at the intersection point is given by:

13

lz

i

a

q

lz



jp

i.e. we have two tiles of the brane tiling, the tile corresponding to the node i of the quiver in the quadrant (+z, +z), the tile corresponding to the node j of the quiver in the quadrant (-z, -z), and an edge
between those tiles, corresponding to an arrow a : i  j of the quiver. The corresponding framed quiver,
which we denote by QD, has one framing node  and two framing arrows q :   i and p : j  , i.e. ((QD)0, (QD)1) = (Q0  {}, Q1  {p, q}. The potential for the frame quiver is obtained by adding the cycle paq to the original unframed potential,

WD = W + paq

(2.22)

We denote by ZD(x) the generating series of the virtual motives [MQD,WD,d]vir of D-cyclic critical representations, following the definitions in (2.4) and (2.7). To our knowledge, there is no known simple expression
of the generating series ZD(x) in terms of the unframed generating series A(x) similar to the formula (2.21) expressing Zi(x) in terms of A(x).

The authors of [8] prove some general properties of D-cyclic critical representations. First, in section 3.7 of loc. cit. it is proven that the arrow p always vanishes in such representations. Taking the partial derivative pWD = aq, the arrow p gives the relation aq = 0. Second, in section 3.8 it is shown that this relation imposes that in fact all the arrows of the cut I vanish. This shows that the CQD/(WD) module of paths with source at a framing node PD is generated by paths beginning by the framing node q, followed by a paths of the quiver Q obtained from Q by removing the arrows of I.

In the periodic quiver plane, the paths of Q beginning at the node i extend in the facet between the two

half lines directed by lz, lz intersecting at i. Indeed, the Zag arrows of the zig-zag paths associated to z are in I, preventing paths of Q to cross the half line directed by lz, and the Zig arrows of the zig-zag paths associated to z are in I, preventing paths of Q to cross the half line directed by lz . As example, for the conifold, it gives:

lz

Where we have drawn the edges of the perfect matching in red and filled in gray the nodes of the periodic quiver that are acessible from the node 0 after having removed the arrows of the cut.

2.4 Partially invertible and nilpotent representations
Let us choose a side z of the toric diagram. We have seen that the toric coordinate ez  C[M +] of X is identified with the element iQ0 viz in the center of the jacobian algebra J. The noncommutative analogue of sheaves supported on the locus of X where one of the toric coordinate ez is nonvanishing (resp. vanishing) are critical representations V where the endomorphism of V iQ0 viz is invertible (resp. nilpotent). Definition 2.10. For two disjoint subsets ZI and ZN in the set of sides of the toric diagram, we denote by MZQI,d:I,ZN :N (resp. MZQIf:,Id,ZN :N ) the substack of MQ,d (resp. the subscheme MQf ,d) of unframed (resp. f -cyclic) representations such that for all z  ZI (resp. z  ZN ) and i  Q0, each cycle v  CQ whose image
14

in JQ is viz is in vertible (resp nilpotent). one obtains that MZQI,W:I,,Zd N :N (resp. MQZIf:,IW,Z,dN :N ) is defined by the condition iQ0 viz is invertible (resp nilpotent) for z  ZI (resp z  ZN ).
We use then (2.4) and (2.7) to define the virtual motives [MZQI,W:I,,dZN :N ]vir (resp. [MQf ,Wf ,d]vir) and their generating series AZI :I,ZN :N (resp. ZfZI:I,ZN :N ). We use the superscript I (resp. N ) instead of ZI : I, ZN : N when ZI (resp. ZN ) is the whole set of paths of the toric diagram, and call the corresponding representations, generating series 'totally invertible' (resp. 'totally nilpotent'). Recalling that the sides of the toric diagram are cyclically ordered, we use also intervals notations like [z, z], to denote the set the sides of the toric diagram enumerated in the clockwise order, starting at z and ending at z.

Consider a short exact sequence of d1, d = d1 + d2 and d2 dimensional critical representations of the unframed quiver:

0  V1  V  V2  0

(2.23)

The operator v  CQ is upper triangular with respect to this block decomposition, with diagonal blocks v|V1 and v|V2 , i.e. v is invertible (resp. nilpotent) in V if and only it is invertible (resp. nilpotent) in V1 and V2. This shows that V  MZQI,d:I,ZN :N if and only if V1  MZQI,d:I1,ZN :N and V2  MQZI,d:I2,ZN :N , i.e. , the collections of representations in V  MZQI,d:I,ZN :N forms a Serre subcategory of the category of representations of the unframed quiver.

In [1] and [18], the authors introduce the cohomological hall algebra and the wall crossing formula for virtual motives of representations lying in a Serre subcategory of the category of critical representations. The theorems of [1] then imply a wall crossing formula for the partition functions AZI :I,ZN :N . Theorem A of [22] also works for Serre subcategories, and implies that for any generic stability condition  we have the decomposition into BPS invariants, and we can define the partially invertible/nilpotent BPS invariants and their generating series:

AZI :I,ZN :N = Exp
l

Z,Id:I,ZN :N -L1/2 + L-1/2

xd

dl

ZI :I,ZN :N (x) =

Z,Id:I,ZN :N xd

d

(2.24)

where the product is taken over the rays l of NQ0 , with increasing slope i idi/ i di.

In particular, for a dimension vector d, and d a small deformation of the self stability condition -, d generic such that d(d) = 0, we can define the attractor invariants, and their generating series:

Z,Id:I,ZN :N = ZdI,:dI,ZN :N

Z I :I,ZN :N (x) =

Z,Id:I,ZN :N xd

d

(2.25)

Theorem 3.7 of [2], based on the theory of cluster scattering diagrams developed in [23], states that attractors invariants ,d are well defined, i.e. they do not depend on the small generic deformation d. Since the formalism of cluster scattering diagram also applied when restricting to a Serre subcategory of the category of representations of a quiver, the same arguments ensure that Z,Id:I,ZN :N are also well defined.

The formula (2.21) is a variant of the wall crossing formula, and can be obtained using the framework of [1]. It therefore continues to hold when restricting to representations and framed representations lying in a Serre subcategory of the category of representations, i.e. we have also:

ZiZI :I,ZN :N (x) = SiAZI :I,ZN :N (x)  S-iAZI :I,ZN :N (x)-1

(2.26)

This formula will allows us to go back and forth between framed representations, where toric localization allows to compute partially nilpotent partition functions, and unframed representations, where one has an invertible/nilpotent factorization of partition functions.

Any generic stability condition  gives a crepant resolution X p X, by taking the moduli space of -stable -dimensional critical representations of (Q, W ), as proven in theorem 4.5 of [20]. Denote by XZ:I the open locus of representations such that iQ0 viz is invertible for z  Z, i.e. XZ:I = zZ (ez p)-1(C).

15

Lemma 2.11. For Z a set of sides of the toric diagram, one has:

Zn:I = -L3/2[XZ:I ] f or n  1

(2.27)

In particular, for ZI =  (remark 5.2 of [2]): n = -L3/2 - (b - 3 + i)L1/2 - iL-1/2f or n  1

(2.28)

where b is the number of boundary points of the toric diagram and i is the number of internal points of the toric diagram

Proof: As shown in [20, Theorem 4.5], there is an equivalence between the bounded derived category of
critical representations of (Q, W ) and the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on X. This derived equivalence restricts to a derived equivalence between the bounded derived category of critical representations such that iQ0 viz is invertible for z  Z, and the bounded derived category of sheaves on XZ:I. In particular, the motivic DT/PT correspondance proven in [24], and the wall crossing formula expressing the DT/PT wall
crossing in terms of the BPS invariants ,d, proven in [6] and [7] applies, giving:

[(XZ:I )[n]]virxn = Exp

(2.30)

i.e. we can identify:

Zn:I = -L3/2[XZ:I ] f or n  1

where we have dropped the dependence on  because n is in the kernel of the antisymmetrized Euler form. In particular, the computation of the motivic class [X] in lemma 4.2 of [2] gives the claimed expression for n, as explained in [2, Remark 5.2].

It is important to stress that not all results of Donaldson-Thomas theory extend to the partially invertible and invariants. In particular, the purity result does not hold for the BPS invariants Z,Id:I,ZN :N , as will become apparent in the formulae of propositions 4.4 and 4.5.

3 Toric localization for framed quivers with potential
In this section we consider a framed quiver with potential (Qf , Wf ), and a torus T scaling the arrows of Qf for which Wf is homogeneous. We describe the T fixed locus, and, for a slope s, the attracting locus of the corresconding one dimensional torus Ts  T . We then study the virtual tangent space at the T fixed locus, and prove our derived Bialynicki-Birula decomposition. Finally, we apply these results to the concrete problem of localization of D6 and D4 framed invariants of toric quivers.
3.1 Torus fixed variety and attracting variety
The torus T acts on MQf ,d, the moduli space of f -cyclic representation. We denote by MTQf ,d the space T -fixed points of MQf ,d. For s a generic slope, i.e. a generic one-dimensional torus Ts  T such that MTQsf ,d = MTQf ,d, we denote by MAQsf ,d the subscheme of MQf ,d given by representations flowing to a fixed point when Ts  t  0, called the attracting variety. We will consider in the sequel, for s¯ = (sd)d a family of generic slopes indexed by the dimension vector, the generating series ZfAs¯ of virtual motives of the critical

We

have a natural correspondence

MTQf ,d p MAQsf ,d  MQf ,d

(3.1)

with  being the natural closed embedding in MQf ,d, and p being the projection on the limit when t  0.

Recall that Pf is the CQf module of paths of Qf with source at the framing node , Pf,i is the vector
space of paths with source  and target i  (Qf )0. An f -cyclic representation V  MQf ,d is a (d, 1) dimensional quotient of Pf by a submodule (V ) = i(Qf )0 i(V ): one has Vi = Pf,i/i(V ), and, for (a : i  j)  (Qf )1, the map a : Vi  Vj is the map induced on the quotients from the map a : Pf,i  Pf,j
given by the structure of CQf -module.

Recall that the T action on paths gives an LT -grading on Pf,i. A slope s is a group homomorphism s : LT  Z: a path of weight  flows to zero (resp. diverges) when the scaling parameter t  0 if s() > 0 (resp. s() < 0). One has a Z-filtration on any quotient: (Vi) = (Pf,i)/i(V ), and one says that this filtration is s-bounded from below if V< = 0 (equivalently  = (Pf,i)) for   0. One can consider the map gr·, sending a subspace of Pf onto its graded part, i.e. gr() is the projection of  onto (Pf ).
Proposition 3.1. i) The T -fixed locus MTQf ,d is given by LT -graded representations, i.e. quotients by an LT homogeneous submodule.
ii) The attracting variety MAQsf ,d is given by representations V such that the LT -filtration is bounded from below: V flows then when t  0 to the representation V 0 with corresponding submodule (V 0) = gr·((V ))

Proof: The path algebra Pf is infinite dimensional, but we can consider the finite dimensional subspace Pf l of paths with lenght  l starting at the framing node , and Pf,li the subspace of such paths with target on the node i  (Qf )0. Given a d dimensional representation V , consider the filtration:

V = Pf 0/0(V )  ...  Pf l/l(V )  Pfl+1/l+1(V )  ...

(3.2)

defining l(V ) := (V )  Pf l. If this filtration stabilizes at a given rank l, then, because  is a submodule, the filtration must stabilize at all ranks larger than l. In particular, this filtration stabilizes after rank |d| = iQ0 di, i.e. :

Vi = Pf,|id|/i |d|(V ) = Pf,i/i(V )

(3.3)

and one has an embedding:

|d| : MQf ,d 

Gr(di, Pf,|id|)

i(Qf )0

(3.4)

denoting by Gr(di, Pf,|id|) the (finite dimensional) Grassmanian giving di-codimensional subspaces of Pf,|id|. The LT -grading on Pf |d| induce a T action on the Grassmanians, such that |d| is T equivariant: we can then use the well known theory of toric localization on finite dimensional Grassmanians in order to describe
the fixed and attracting loci of MQf ,d.

One can associate to any   i(Qf )0 Gr(di, Pf,|id|) the submodule () of Pf generated by . One
has   ()|d|, i.e. ()|d| is of codimension d  d in Pf |d|. Considering, as in (3.2), the filtration Pf l/()l, it must stabilize after the rank |d| because |d|  |d|, i.e. () is of codimension d in Pf . One has then a map:

:

Gr(di, Pf,|id|) 

Gr( di, Pf,i)

i(Qf )0

i(Qf )0

(3.5)

denoting Gr( di, Pf,i) the (infinite dimensional) Grassmanian of subspaces of codimension at most di of Pf,i. In particular, for V an f -cyclic representation:

(|d|(V )) = (V )

(3.6)

17

The image of the embedding of MQf ,d into i(Qf )0 Gr(di, Pf,|id|) is determined by the condition ()|d| = , i.e. :

|d|(MQf ,d) = -1(

Gr(di, Pf,i))

i(Qf )0

(3.7)

To establish i), note that fixed points under the T -action of the finite dimensional Grassmanian are LT graded subspaces, i.e. an f cyclic representation V is T -fixed if and only if |d|(V ) is LT -graded, and, from (3.3), |d|(V ) is LT -graded iff (V ) is LT -graded, giving i) in the proposition.

To establish i), note that objects i of the Grassmanian Gr(di, Pf,|id|) admit a natural LT -filtration (i). One can consider the graded object gr·(i)  Gr(di, Pf,|id|). Considering now i  Gr(di, Pf,i), one has:

(Pf,i/i) (Pf,i/i)<

= (Pf,i/gr·(i))

(3.8)

i.e. gr·(i) is of codimension at most than di in Pf,i, and is of codimension di iff the LT -filtration on the quotient is bounded from below. One then has the diagram:

i(Qf )0 Gr(di, Pf,|id|)



i(Qf )0 Gr( di, Pf,i)

gr·

gr·

i(Qf )0 Gr(di, Pf,|id|)



i(Qf )0 Gr( di, Pf,i)

Considering   i(Qf )0 Gr(di, Pf,|id|), () = (v.)v , for v paths of Qf , which are LT homogeneous, i.e. gr·  () = gr·( (v.)v ) = (v.gr·())v =   gr·(), giving the commutativity of the above diagram.

In the finite dimensional Grassmanian Gr(di, Pf,|id|), a subspace flows to its LT -graded part, i.e.

lim
t0

t.

=

gr·()

(3.9)

A representation V  MQf ,d flows to a representation V 0  MTQf ,d if and only if one has

gr·(|d|(V ))  |d|(MQf ,d)

   gr·(|d|(V )) 

Gr(di, Pf,i)

i(Qf )0

 gr·((V )) 

Gr(di, Pf,i)

i(Qf )0

(3.10)

the second line holds from (3.7), and the third from the commutative diagram and (3.6). It follows from the
remark after (3.8) that gr·((V )) is of codimension d iff the LT -filtration on V is bounded from below. In this case, one has from (3.9):

|d|(V 0) =gr·(|d|(V ))  (V 0) =(|d|(V 0)) =   gr·(|d|(V ))
=gr·  (|d|(V )) = gr·((V ))

(3.11)

which concludes the proof of ii).

Since fixed points are LT -graded, one can endow the restriction of the tautological sheaf Vi (for i  (Qf )0) to the fixed locus with a T equivariant structure:

Vi = (Vi)t-


(3.12)

t- being the trivial line bundle with T equivariant weight - on the T -fixed locus. This induces a partition:

MTQf ,d =

MTQf ,



(3.13)

18

where  runs among cocharacters of the gauge group Gd = iQ0 Gldi . Note that MTQf , is a union of connected components of MTQf ,d. Likewise, we get a partition:

MAQsf ,d =

MAQsf ,



(3.14)

where MAQsf , is the locally closed subscheme of MAQsf ,d of points flowing to MTQf , when t  0. Denoting
by TWf the vanishing cycle functor of the functional T r(Wf )|MTQf , , and by pMTQf , the projection of MTQf , onto a point, we define the virtual motive of the citical locus of the T -fixed component MTQf ,Wf , := MTQf ,  MQf ,Wf ,d:

[MTQf ,Wf , ]vir =(-L1/2)- dim(MTQf ,)Hc(MTQf , , TWf QMTQf , ) =(-L1/2)- dim(MTQf ,)D(pMTQf , )!TWf (pMTQf , )Q =(-L1/2)- dim(MTQf ,)(pMTQf , )TWf (pMTQf , )!Q

(3.15)

We denote by f the set of cocharacters  of Gd such that MTQf ,Wf , is not empty (for varying d). For   f we will write d for the corresponding dimension vector. When Assumption 2.1 is satisfied, the above definition is consistent with the definition of f as the set of finite ideals of the poset f .

3.2 The Tangent-Obstruction complex

To obtain a localisation formula, we will study the T -equivariant tangent space of a component MTQf ,Wf , of the T -fixed locus, in the moduli space MQf ,Wf ,d of f -cyclic critical representations of the framed quiver. Because the moduli space is not smooth, but is the critical loci of the functional T r(Wf ) on the smooth scheme MQf ,d, we will consider the virtual tangent/obstruction complex considered in appendix E of [25], and its T equivariant refinement. For the framed quiver with potential (Qf , Wf ), this can be computed from
the sequence [25]

0  S0 0 S1 1 S2 2 S3  0

(3.16)

Recall that the tautological sheaves Vi are equiped with a T equivariant structure on MTQf ,d, an one denotes by t the trivial line bundle on MTQf ,d with T equivariant weight   LT . The various parts of the exact sequence are defined as follows:

· The space S0 is the space of infinitesimal gauge transformations gi (we denote for convenience gi = 0 for i a framing node):

S0 =

HomC(Vi, Vi)

(3.17)

iQ0

· the differential 0 is the linearization of gauge transformations (taking care of the fact that framing

nodes are not gauged):

0 : (gi)iQ0  (gj a - agi)(a:ij)(Qf )1

(3.18)

· S1 is the space of infinitesimal deformations of the arrows (a):

S1 =

HomC(Vi, Vj)  ta

(a:ij)(Qf )1

(3.19)

· The differential 1 is the linearization of the potential relations ra = aWf = 0:

1 : (a)a(Qf )1  ((rb/a).a)b(Qf )1

(3.20)

· S2 is the space of potential relations ra = aW : for a : k  j, it is a relation between paths vi : j  k such that avi are cycles of the potential of weight , so the vi have weight  - a, giving:

S2 =

HomC(Vj , Vk)  t-a = S¯1  t

(ra:jk)R~

(3.21)

19

· 2 is linearization of relations between relations of the potential corresponding to each gauged node i:

2 : (ra)a(Qf )1  (

ra.a -

a.ra )iQ0

a:ij

a:ji

Indeed, we can show for each gauged node i:

(3.22)

2(aWf )) = 0

(3.23)

when we multiply a relation aWf by a, we obtain a relation between cycles of the potential. In fact, for each time that a given cycle v of the potential passes by the node i, there will be an arrow a : j  i,
so v will appear in aWf .a, i.e. in 2(aWf )i with a + sign; and an arrow b : i  j, so v will appear in b.bWf , so in 2(bWf )i with a - sign; i.e. all these contributions cancels and 2(aWf )i = 0 as claimed.

· Finally, S3 is the space of relations between relations of the potential. For each [jargon:gauged] node i it is a sum of cycles of the potential, i.e. of weights , so:

S3 =

HomC(Vi, Vi)  t = S¯0  t

iQ0

(3.24)

As shown in [25, §E], the sequence (3.16) is a complex, self-dual up to a twist by t, whose cohomology is supported in cohomological degree 1 and 2. The interpretation of the cohomology at S1 is clear: it corresponds to first order deformations of the arrows that respect the relations of the potential up to infinitesimal gauge
transformation, i.e. it is the tangent space to the moduli scheme of framed representations. According to the general principles of deformation theory, S2 are the obstructions to have higher order deformations. There is no higher obstructions, and the obstructions are dual to the first order deformations up to a factor t, i.e. the
virtual dimension of the moduli scheme is zero. This property of the Tangent Obstruction complex is general
for critical loci of a potential; and corresponds to the notion of [-1]-shifted symplectic structure in derived
geometry.

So we have the virtual tangent/obstruction class, given in T equivariant K-theory by:
Tvir = Deformations - Obstructions = -S0 + S1 - S2 + S3 = -S0 + S1 - t(-S¯0 + S¯1)

(3.25)

The non equivariant tangent/obstruction complex is self-dual, but its T -equivariant version of is not, unless
 = 0. Henceforth we shall restrict to a torus T leaving the potential Wf invariant, such that  = 0. Consider that we have selected a slope s, such that the fixed points of the corresponding one dimensional torus are the fixed points of T . We denote by d0+ (resp. d1+) the number of contracting weights (i.e. such that ps() > 0) in S0 (resp. in S1), d0- (resp. d1-) the number of repelling weights (i.e. such that ps() < 0) in S0 (rep S1), and d00 (resp. d10) the number of weights in S0 (resp. in S1) that are invariants with this choice of slope (i.e. such that ps() = 0). One should then count with sign, for each MTQf ,, the number of weights of T vir that become contracting when t  0 in C. This count is given, according to (3.25), by:

Indexs = -d0+ + d1+ - d1- + d0-

(3.26)

Remark 3.2. : When the moduli space of cyclic representations is projective, the formalism of K-theoretic localization gives a way to express K-theoretic Donalson-Thomas invariants of the whole moduli space in
terms of those of the T -fixed locus, as introduced in [10]. K-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas invariants provide a refinement of numerical Donaldson-Thomas invariants depending on a parameter y, which is expected to
coincide with the y2 genus of the motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants, obtained in particular by replacing L by y2. Denoting [MTQf ,Wf ,]K the K-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas invariant of the locus MTQf ,Wf ,, the generating series ZfK (x) of K-theoretic invariants of f cyclic representations is then given by:

ZfK (x) =

(-y)Indexs¯ [MTQf ,]K xd

d d

(3.27)

20

This formula does not apply directly to moduli spaces that are not projective. In particular, the generating series obtained by this formula depends on the choice of the family of slopes s¯ = (sd)d, and does not correspond in general with the y2 genus of the motivic partition functions computed using the formalism of [1].

One of the simplest cases of K-theoretic localization for non projective moduli spaces, studied in [10], is the Hilbert scheme of points on C3. The fixed points are then given by plane partitions. Choosing the families of slopes ±s¯ judiciously such that there are a lot of cancellations in the computation of the index, one finds two prescriptions for the cohomological weight of the fixed points, giving respectively the refined generating
series :





ZiK,±s¯(x) = Exp -y±1

(-y)n - (-y)-n -y + y

-1

xn



n1

(3.28)

in agreement with the so called refined topological vertex formalism introduced in [26]. This formula however differs from the y2 genus of the motivic generating series computed in [12]:





Zi(x) = Exp -y3

(-y)n -y

- +

(-y)-n y-1

xn



n1

(3.29)

In [15], the author investigates precisely the dependance on the slope of the K-theoretic generating series for non projective moduli spaces arising in the topological vertex, and draws a precise comparison with the formalism of the refined topological vertex. The author exhibits a chamber and wall structure on the slopes, in which, crossing a wall corresponds to changing the attracting/repelling behaviour of the weight lz corresponding to a side z of the toric diagram.

Taking inspiration from the K-theoretic localization, we shall prove in the motivic setting that the generating series computed from localization at a given slope gives in fact the generating series ZfAs¯ of the virtual motives of the attracting variety of the corresponding one-dimensional generic subtorus of T (In particular, this is consistent with the analysis of [15], because the attracting variety changes exactly when the attracting/repelling behaviour of the weight lz corresponding with a side z of the toric diagram changes). If we were considering smooth moduli spaces, and not critical loci of a potential, this would follows from a BialynickiBirula decomposition: the attracting variety would be a fibration on the fixed point set, with affine fiber of rank the number of contracting weights in the tangent space. This result can be viewed as an extension of the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition to the derived setting.

(3.30)

Proof: We fix a cocharacter   f . One has a correspondence:

MTQf , p MAQsf ,  MQf ,d

(3.31)

with  being a closed embedding, and d the projection given by the flow when t  0. We have:

dim(MQf ,d) = dim(S1) - dim(S0) =d1+ + d1- + d10 - d0+ - d0- - d00
dim(MTQf ,) =d10 - d00

(3.32)

Representations flowing to a given T -fixed representation V 0 were characterized in the proof of proposition 3.1: one has gr·((V )) = (V0), i.e. taking the quotients:

(Vi)/(Vi)< = (Vi0) i  (Qf )0,   LT

(3.33)

21

Once we have fixed a section of the LT -filtrations on Vi, i.e. , for each i  (Qf )0,   LT , a section of
(Vi)  (Vi)/(Vi)< (the moduli space of such section is affine of dimension dim((Vi)) dim((Vi)<)), we have an isomorphism between V and V 0. We can then define B as the set of pairs (V, (vi,) with V  MQf , and (vi,) a choice of section, and the forgetful map q : B  MAQsf ,: it is an affine bundle of rank:

rank(q) =

dim((Vi)) dim((Vi)<) = d0+

i(Qf )0 LT

(3.34)

where we have used in particular d = 1. Now, consider the map pq : B  MTQf ,. Once we have chosen a section, V is identified with V 0 as a vector space, but the morphisms associated to arrows of the quiver can differ: for (a : i  j)  (Qf )1, we denote by a the associated morphism in V , and a0 the associated morphism in V 0. The morphism a respects the LT -filtration on V , and one has a0 = gr·(a), i.e. a = a0 + LT (a), with (a) : (Vi)  (Vj )<. Conversely, any such deformation of a0 induces an f cyclic representation flowing to V 0 when t  0, i.e. pq is an affine bundle of rank:

rank(pq) =

dim((Vi)) dim((Vj )<+a) = d1+

(a:ij)(Qf )1 LT

(3.35)

Therefore one obtain

(p)(p)! =L-d0+ (p)(q )(q)!(p)! = Ld1+-d0+ Id

(3.36)

using the fact that q and pq are affine bundle. The key element is the lemma 8.3.4 of [27] (see also [28]): Lemma 3.4. The hyperbolic restriction p! intertwines the vanishing cycles functors Wf on MQf ,d and TWf on MTQf ,d:

p!Wf =TWf p!

(3.37)

We can compute:

[MAQsfd,Wf ,d]vir =(-L1/2)- dim(MQf ,d)(pMA Qsf ,d )!Wf (pMQf ,d )!Q

=(-L1/2)- dim(MQf ,d)(pMTQf ,d )p!Wf (pMQf ,d )!Q

f |d=d

(3.38)

Here, the first line holds by definition (2.4), the second because pMA Qsf ,d = pMTQf ,d p, the third follows from lemma 3.4, the fourth from pMQf ,d  = pMTQf ,d p, the fifth from a sum over the disjoint components MTQf ,d =
 MTQf ,, the sixth from (3.36), and the last from the definition (3.15), and a careful dimension counting
using (3.26) and (3.32). Summing over the dimensions vector d, we obtain the desired result.

Corollary 3.5. If the assumption 2.1 is satisfied by the framed quiver (Qf , Wf ), one has:

ZfAs¯(x) =

Proof: A (1, d)-dimensional critical representation which is a fixed point of the maximal torus T leaving
the potential invariant (whose weight lattice is f /Z) is, according to proposition 3.1, a f /Z-graded critical representation, and then quotients of Pf by a f /Z-homogeneous submodule with codimension (1, d). According to lemma 2.2, those submodules are in bijection with cocharacters   f such that d = d, i.e. MTQf ,Wf , is just an isolated point and [MTQf ,Wf ,]vir = 1.

3.4 Toric localization for D6 and D4 brane framings

The maximal torus scaling the arrows of the D6 brane framed quiver Qi (see section 2.3.1) by leaving the potential W equivariant (resp. invariant) has weight lattice i =  × Zq (resp. i/Z). The maximal torus scaling the arrows of the D4 brane framed quiver QD (see section 2.3.2) by leaving the potential W equivariant (resp. invariant) has weight lattice D =  × Zq × Zp/(q + a + p - ) (resp. D/Z). In these two cases, the scaling of the arrow q can be compensated by the action of the gauge torus TG (scaling all the nodes except ): the weight lattice of the maximal torus leaving the potential equivariant (resp. invariant) quotiented by
TG is then still M (resp. L).

Lemma 3.6. The assumption 2.1 is satisfied for the D6- brane and D4 brane framings (Qi, W ) and (Qf , W ).

Proof:

· i) A cycle of Qi is a cycle of Q (resp. a cycle of QD acting nontrivially on PD is a cycle of Q), having a nonvanishing weight in   i when it is nontrivial in CQ (resp.   D) from [9].

· ii) A path which do not vanish in Pi,j (resp. PD,j) is of the form vp, with v a path of Q, and two paths with he same -weights agree in J, then (Pi,j ) (resp. (PD,j)) is at most one dimensional for   i (resp.   D).
· iii) Consider  a i/Z homogeneous submodule of Pi (resp. a D/Z homogeneous submodule of PD). It was shown in [9] that any path v : i   of Q can be written in CQ/W as wnv0, for v0 : i   a minimal path of the unframed quiver, w :    an arbitrary cycle of the potential W , and n  N, and recall that any cycle of W contains an arrow of I, and then has a trivial action on PD. Then for   Q0, l  i/Z (resp. l  D/Z) such that (Pi,)l (resp. (PD,)l) is not empty, one has:

(PD,)l = v0p (Pi,)l = (wnv0p)nN

(3.40)

with v0 : i   a minimal path of the periodic quiver and w :    a cycle of W . Consider  = ,l ,l a i/Z homogeneous submodule of Pi (resp. a D/Z homogeneous submodule of PD). For a 'D4 brane' framing ,l is automatically Z-homogeneous, and then  = ,l ,l is D-homogeneous.
Consider now a D6-brane framing. For z a side of the toric diagram and j  Q0, the cycle vz has a nonvanishing weight lz  L  i/Z, then for a fixed l  i/Z the set of weights ( + nlz)nN is unbounded: because  is i/Z-graded and of finite codimension, one has (vz)n.(Pi,)l   for n  0. From [20, corollary 3.6], the set (M +)Q of weights of cycles of Q is a cone which external rays are generated by the weights of the vjz for z a side of the toric diagram, and that two cycles with the same source and M weights agree in J. There is then an integer m  N such that wm can be expressed as a product of the commuting operators vjz, showing that for n  0 wn.(Pi,)l  , i.e. ,l = (wnv0p)nN for an N  N: ,l is then Z-homogeneous, and then  is i-graded.

We can then define the poset i of i-weights of paths of Pi (resp. the poset D of D-weights of paths of PD). When we choose a section of the quotient by TG, i.e. a projection of i (resp. D) into MQ, i can be depicted as a three dimensional pyramid with an atom of color i on the top, and D looks like a facet of this pyramid whose projection on the periodic quiver plane LQ = MQ/Z is the facet lying between the two half directed by lz and lz considered in the definition of the 'D4 brane' framing. Finite ideals in i (resp. D) can then be depicted as finite subpyramids of i (resp. finite subfacets of D).
Now we consider a choice of slope s, i.e. a generic choice of subtorus of the maximal torus leaving the potential invariant, such that fixed points of the whole torus are also fixed points of the one dimensional torus:

23

it corresponds to the choice of a generic quotient s : i/Z  Z (resp. D/Z  Z). The action of the torus T scaling the arrows by leaving the potential invariant factorizes into an action of T /TG on MQi,W,d (resp. MQD,WD,d), and then the attracting variety MAQsi,W,d (resp. MAQsD,WD,d) depends only on the quotient s|L : L  Z. Moreover the i/Z- (resp. D/Z-) weights of the tangent obstruction complex lies in the subblattice L. For these reasons, we can consider a slope s as the data of the quotient s|L, i.e. as a generic line separating L into two subsets L+ = (s|L)-1(N) and L- = (s|L)-1(-N), respectively the sets of weight which become contracting and repelling under the slope s when t  0. The weights lz~ associated to a side z of the toric diagram can lie in L+ or L-: the genericity of the torus forbids lz  (s|L)-1(0).

Lemma 3.7. · For D the divisor corresponding to the corner p of the toric diagram lying between the two sides z, z, noting Z = {z~  {z, z}|lz~  L-}, one has:

MAQsD,WD ,d = MZQ:DN,WD ,d

(3.41)

· If lz~  L-  z~  [z, z], then

MAQsi,W,d = M[Qzi,z,W]:,Nd

(3.42)

Proof: According to proposition 3.1, a critical representation which is a quotient Pi/ (resp. PD/) is in the attracting locus of T if and only if the Z-filtration on Pi/ (resp. PD/) is bounded by below, i.e. if n = (Pi)n (resp. n = (PD)n) for n  0.

If Pi/ (resp. PD/) lies in the attracting locus of T , then for z~ a side of the toric diagram such that lz~  L-,   Q0 and n  Z, (vjz )n.(Pi,)n0  (Pi,)n0+nps(lz)   (resp. (vjz )n.(PD,)n0  (PD,)n0+nps(lz)  ) for n  0, then vz is nilpotent on Pi/ (resp. PD/).

Suppose now that vz~ acts nilpotently on Pi/ (resp. PD/) for   Q0, and z~  [z, z] (resp. z~  Z). Recall that C[M +] is identified as the center of J. Consider a path v  Pi, (resp. v  PD,) From [20, corrolary 3.6], M + is saturated in the cone MQ+ which is the convex hull of the rays with direction z~, for z~ a side of the toric diagram. Because each arrow of I acts trivially on PD, only the subcone MQ+  ¯I -1(0), which is the convex hull of the rays with direction z and z , acts nontrivially on PD. One has (vz~)nv   for n  0 and z~  [z, z] (resp. z~  Z), showing that wv   for w  M + and ps(w)  0, i.e. (C[M +].v)n   for n  0. It is proven in the proof of proposition 3.13 of [20] that the C[M +] module of paths of Q0 with source i and target  is finitely generated, which implies that Pi, (resp. PD,) is a finitely generated C[M +] module, showing that (Pi,)n   (resp. (PD,)n  ) for n  0.
We can now combine the lemmas 3.6 and 3.7 with the result of the corrolary 3.5:

Theorem 3.8. · For D a non-compact divisor of X, corresponding to the corner p of the toric diagram lying between the two sides z, z, and a family generic slopes s¯ = (sd)d such that lz, lz  L+ (such slopes
always exist, because the angle between lz and lz is smaller than ), we have:

ZD(x) =

(-L1/2)Indexsd xd

D

(3.43)

· For a family of generic slopes s¯ = (sd)d such that lz~  L-  z~  [z, z], we have:

Zi[z,z]:N (x) =

(-L1/2)Indexsd xd

i

(3.44)

Considering a family of generic slopes s¯, one can consider also the opposite family of slopes -s¯, corresponding with the inverses one dimensional generic subtorus. One has Index-sd = -Indexsd , and taking the opposite slope amouts to interchange L+ and L-: if the attracting variety for the slope sd is MQ[zi,,zW[ ,d, the attracting variety for the slope -sd is then M[Qzi,z,W[ ,d, giving:

Zi[z,z[:N = Zi[z,z[:MN

(3.45)

24

Lemma 3.9. For any set Z of corners of the toric diagram , and Zc its complementary, we have the equivalence between:

Z :N (x) = Z c:N (x) AZ:N = (AZc:N )-1
ZiZ:N = ZiZc:N i  Q0

(3.46) (3.47) (3.48)

Proof: We first show that the duality properties for A and Zi for all i  Q0 are equivalent. Using (2.21):

ZiZc:N =(SiAZc:N S-i(AZc:N )-1) =S-i(AZc:N )-1)Si(AZc:N )

=Si(AZc:N )-1S-i(AZc:N )

=(SiAZc:N )-1(S-iAZc:N )

(3.49)

Where we have used the equations (2.9). It gives:

ZiZ:N = ZiZc:N  (SiAZ:N )(S-iAZ:N )-1 = (SiAZc:N )-1(S-iAZc:N )  SiAZc:N SiAZ:N = S-iAZc:N S-iAZ:N  Si(AZc:N AZ:N ) = S-i(AZc:N AZ:N )
 SiB = S-iB

(3.50)

where we have denoted temporarily B = (AZc:N )AZ:N . If B = 1, i.e. the duality property holds for A,
we have from the equivalence (3.50) that the duality property holds for all Zi's. We show the converse now. Suppose that the duality property holds for all Zi's, i.e. SiB = S-iB i  Q0. We developp B as:

B = Pdxd
d
S±iB = Pd(-L1/2)±di xd
d

(3.51)

with Pd elements of the Grothendieck group of monodromic mixed Hodge structure. By identifications of the terms in SiB = S-iB, we find that Pd = 0 for di = 0. Because this is true for all i  Q0, we have:
B = P0 = B(0) = AZc:N (0)AZ:N (0) = 1

The last property holding because the term of AZ:N and AZc:N coefficient x0 is 1. We deduce then that the duality property holds for the A.

We now show that the duality properties for A and for the BPS invariants  are equivalent. Consider a generic King stability (d). We have from the wall crossing formula:

AZ:N =

Exp(

Z,:dN -L1/2 + L-1/2

xd

)

l

dl

AZc:N =

Exp(

Z,cd:N -L1/2 + L-1/2

)

AZc:N =

Exp(

-Z,cd:N -L1/2 + L-1/2

xd

)

l

dl

(AZc:N )-1 =

Exp(

Z,cd:N -L1/2 + L-1/2

xd

)

l

dl

(3.52)

Recalling that the transformation  and the inverse A  A-1 are anti-involutions, i.e. reverse the order of the product in the quantum affine plane. By identification, using the fact that BPS invariants are uniquely defined, it gives:

AZ:N = (AZc:N )-1  Z,:dN = Z,cd:N d

(3.53)

25

This shows that the BPS invariants at any generic stability  satisfy the duality properties if and only if A satisfies them.

Combining this last result with (3.45), one obtain:

Corollary 3.10. For a node i  Q0, and z, z two corners of the toric diagram such that the directions lz~ for z~  [z, z[ and z~  [z, z[ lie in two different half planes of L, we have:

[z,z[:N (x) = [z,z[:N (x)

(3.54)

4 Computation of BPS invariants
In this section, we show how to correct our localization formula, which gives only the BPS invariants of partially nilpotent representations, to obtain the genuine, unconstrained BPS invariants. We then establish the Invertible/Nilpotent decomposition of BPS invariants for unframed toric quivers, compute the invariants of partially invertible representations, and finally combine these results.

4.1 Invertible/Nilpotent decomposition

Let us fix a side z of the toric diagram. Consider a representation in MzQ:,IW,d, i.e. such that the endomorphism iQ0 viz is invertible. For each k  Z/KzZ the connected component Qk is strongly connected: for i, j 
(Qk)0, there is then a path v : i  j and v : j  i in Qk, such that vv : i  i is a cycle of Qk, i.e. is equal in J to a power of viz. It implies that v is invertible, i.e. di = dj. The dimension vector d is then in (zk)k , the linear span with positive integer coefficients of the (zk)k. We have the useful property:
Lemma 4.1. i) The dimension vectors zk (and then the z[kk[, and dimension vectors d such thatMzQ:,IW,d = ) belong to the center of the skew-symmetrized Euler form ·, · .
ii) For any representation such that iQ0 viz is invertible, and I any of the two cuts associated to the corners of the toric diagram adjacent to the side z, the dimension vector d satisfies

Q(d, d) + 2

didj = 0

(a:ij)I

(4.1)

Proof: Let I and I be the two cuts whose union gives the zig-zag path z, ordered clockwise around the toric diagram, i.e. I = Ii, z = zi+1/2, I = Ii+1 in our notations. In §2.2.2 we explained that the arrows of Q can be categorized into four groups Qk1, Jk, Zigk and Zagk for k  Z/KzZ. We notice that the zig-zag path separating Qk and Qk+1 is a succession of arrows of Zigk and arrows of Zagk. Now we can compute for d  NQ0 :

Q(zk, d) +

(di · (zk)j + dj · (zk)i)

(a:ij)I

= di -

(a:ji)Zagk-1

= di(1 - #{a  Qk1|t(a) = i} + #{a  Jk|s(a) = i})
iQk0

+

di(#{a  Zigk|t(a) = i} - #{a  Zagk|s(a) = i}))

iQk0 +1

+

di(#{a  Zigk-1|s(a) = i} - #{a  Zagk-1|t(a) = i}))

iQk0 -1

(4.2)

The fact that this vanishes follows by a careful counting of arrows:

26

· According to [19], zig-zag paths are paths of the brane tiling that alternatively turn maximally right
and maximally left, i.e. each tile of the tiling is bordered either by zero element of Zigk nor Zagk, or by one element of Zigk and one element of Zagk. Because a node i  Qk0 corresponds to a tile of the brane tiling, the term #{a  Zigk|t(a) = i} - #{a  Zagk|s(a) = i} (and for the same reason the term #{a  Zigk-1|s(a) = i} - #{a  Zagk-1|t(a) = i}) vanishes.
· Consider i  Qk0, and the corresponding tile of the brane tiling. The edges of this tile correspond alternatively to incoming and outgoing arrows. Because the strip corresponding to Qk is oriented, there is no arrows 'going back': so if there is two incoming arrows which are in Q1k, the outgoing arrow between these two arrows must be in Jk. An illustration of that is given by the node 1 in the suspended pinched point example: the two incoming arrows 21 and 31 are in Q01, so the arrow 11 is in J0 (it is in blue and red, i.e. it belongs to the two cuts). For the same reasons, if there are m incoming arrows which are Qk1, all the edges of outgoing arrows between those edges must be in Jk, i.e. #{a  Jk|s(a) = i} = m-1, and in particular 1 - #{a  Qk1|t(a) = i} + #{a  Jk|s(a) = i} always vanishes.

i.e. we have:

Q(zk, d) +

(di, (zk)j + dj , (zk)i) = 0

(a:ij)I

(4.3)

By exchanging black and white nodes of the brane tiling, we change the direction of arrows, but we keep the same perfect matchings and zig-zag paths. It amounts to replacing Q(d, d) by Q(d, d). Then, by
symmetry, we also have:

Q(d, zk) +

(di, (zk)j + dj , (zk)i = 0

(a:ij)Iz+1/2

(4.4)

In particular, by substracting (4.3) and (4.4):

i.e. the zk are in the kernel of , .

zk, d = Q(zk, d) - Q(d, zk) = 0

(4.5)

If d  zk , by linearity (4.3) is also true if we replace zk by d, i.e. we obtain:

Q(d, d) + 2

didj = 0

(a:ij)I

(4.6)

The toric diagram is only defined up to an affine transformation: in particular, the clockwise ordering of the corners is only a matter of convention, so by symmetry the same formula holds for I:

Q(d, d) + 2

didj = 0

(a:ij )I 

(4.7)

One denotes by MQ,,sds (resp MQ,,sdt) the coarse moduli space of -semistable (resp stable) representations of Q. In [22], the authors introduce the BPS sheaf on MQ,,sds:

BP

S

 W,d

:=

 IC W

MQ,,sds

if MQ,,sdt =  otherwise

(4.8)

with W denoting the vanishing cycle functor of T r(W ) on MQ,,sds, and IC the intersection cohomology complex. Using the main result of [22], the BPS invariants can be defined also by:

Z,Id:I,ZN :N

(4.9)

We now show the following lemma, which is a direct generalization of the lemma 4.1 of [29] to the case of non-symmetric quivers:

Lemma 4.2. Consider a quiver with potential (Q, W ) and an element iQ0 vi central in J, with vi : i  i cycles, such that representations where iQ0 vi is invertible have a dimension vector in the kernel of the antisymmetrized Euler form , . Then iQ0 vi acts as a scalar on representations in the support of BPSW,d.

27

Proof: We refer to the proof of the lemma 4.1 of [29] for the details of the arguments: here the major
difference is that we consider a quiver which is not symmetric, and then the quantum affine space is not commutative. Considering  generic, i.e. such that if d, d have the same slope then d - d, · = 0, and a ray
l of the form d + ker( , ). The relative integrality theorem from [22] gives:

H(J HW IC ) MQ,,sds = Sym (H (BC)vir  (

BP

S

 W,d

))

dl

dl

(4.10)

where JH is the Jordan-Ho¨lder map sending a semistable object to the associated polystable object and W is the vanishing cycle functor of T r(W ) on MQ,,sds. Consider V  supp(BPSW,d). In particular, V is the polystable object associated with a representation in the support of W , hence in the critical locus of T r(W ), and then V itself is a J-module. Suppose that iQ0 vi, which is central in J, has at least two differents eigenvalues, which we denote 1 and 2. We choose two disjoints open set U1, U2  C such that the eigenvalues of iQ0 vi lies in U1  U2, 1  U1, 2  U2. Given an open set U  C we denote by (MQ,,sds)U (resp (MQ,,sds)U ) the subspace (resp substack) of representations such that iQ0 vi has all his eigenvalues in U , in particular V  (MQ,,sds)U1U2 - ((MQ,,sds)U1  (MQ,,sds)U2 ). A critical representation W  MUQ1,WU,d2 splits cannonically as a direct sum of representations W1, W2 where iQ0 vi has eigenvalues respectively in U1, U2, giving:

(MQ,,sWs ,d)U1U2 =

(MQ,,sWs ,d1 )U1 × (MQ,,sWs ,d2 )U2

d1 +d2 =d

(4.11)

remark here that necessarily at least one of the two Ui is contained in C, say U1, and then contains only representations where iQ0 vi is invertible, i.e. the d1 which gives nontrivial terms in the sum lies in the ray l0 := ker( , ), giving:

(MQ,,sWs ,d)U1U2 =

(MQ,,sWs ,d1 )U1 × (MQ,,sWs ,d2 )U2

dl

dl d1+d2=d

=(

(MQ,,sWs ,d1 )U1 ) × (

(MQ,,sWs ,d2 )U2 )

d1 l0

d2l

(4.12)

By the same argument using a smoothing by framed representations than in the proof of lemma 4.1 of [29], it gives:

H(J HW I CMQ,,sds |(MQ,,sds)U1U2 )
dl

=

H(J HW I CMQ,,sds |(MQ,,sds)U1 ) 

H(J HW I CMQ,,sds |(MQ,,sds)U2 )

d1 l0

d2l

Applying the relative integrality theorem, we obtain then:

W,d1 (MQ,,sds1 )U1

we can then deduce:

(MQ,,sds)U1



(MQ,,sds)U2

(4.16)

but V  (MQ,,sds)U1U2 - ((MQ,,sds)U1  (MQ,,sds)U2 ), and so the restriction of BPSW,d to V is zero. We conclude

then

that

if

V



supp(BP

S

 W,d

),

then

iQ0 vi has a single eigenvalue. For a stable J-module W , because

iQ0 vi is central in J , it defines an element of Hom(W, W ) = C by stability, and then iQ0 vi acts as

a scalar. V is a direct sum of -stable representations where iQ0 vi acts as a scalar, and iQ0 vi has a

single eigenvalue on V , i.e. acts as a scalar on V .

We can now prove the invertible/nilpotent decomposition of BPS invariants:

28

Proposition 4.3. i) For ZI , ZN and ZI = , BPS invariants are not subject to wall crossing, and we denote them by ZI :I,ZN :N (x), forgetting the subscript .

ii) For ZI, ZN and z  ZI  ZN , we have:

Z I :I,ZN :N (x) = ZI :I,ZN ,z:I (x) + ZI :I,ZN :N,z:N (x)

(4.17)

Proof: i) Consider a representation in MZQI,d:I,ZN :N . Take z  ZI : iQ0 viz is then invertible, i.e. by lemma 4.1 i), d  ker , . In particular, the associated term [MZQI,W:I,,dZN :N ]virxd, and then AZI :I,ZN :N (x), is in the center of the quantum affine space, i.e. no wall crossing can occur, and BPS invariants do not depend on the stability parameter .

ii) · Invertible/Nilpotent decomposition:

Recall that the element assumptions of lemma 4.2

iQ0 viz is in the are satisfied, i.e.

center of iQ0 viz

the jacobian algebra J, and from the lemma 4.1 the acts as a scalar on a representation in the support

of

B

P

S

 W,d

.

In particular, the support of BPSW,d is the disjoint union of a locus where the (viz)iQ0 are

invertible, and a locus where they are nilpotent, i.e. :

(4.18)

where the second line holds by taking the induced long exact sequence in cohomology. The result follow by noticing that Z,Id:I,ZN ,z:I doesn't depend on , and by taking the generating series.

4.2 Computation of the partially invertible part

Proposition 4.4. Consider z, z two different sides of the toric diagram, we have:

· if z and z are adjacent to the same corner, then:

z:I,z:I (x) = (-L3/2 + 2L1/2 - L-1/2)

xn

n1

(4.19)

· otherwise:

z:I,z:I (x) = I (x) = (-L3/2 + 3L1/2 - 3L-1/2 + L-3/2) xn
n1

(4.20)

Proof: Consider a subset ZI of the sides of the toric diagram containing at least two elements z = z. For any representation in MZQI,W,d, iQ0 viz and iQ0 viz are invertible. Consider d sucht that MZQI,W,d = : the dimensions di are constant inside the strips delimited by lines directed by lz, and also inside the strips
delimited by lines directed by lz . Since these two sets of lines intersect only at isolated points of the torus, all the di must then be equal. For d   and  generic, there is no  stable representation in MZQI,d, i.e. the BPS invariants Z,Id vanish, giving:

ZI :I (x) =

nZI :I xn

n

= - L-3/2[XZI :I ]

xn

n1

(4.21)

where we have used Lemma 2.11 in the second line, considering a generic stability condition . Recall that we have X = Spec(C[M +]), and then XZI:I = Spec(C[M +, (e-z )zZI ]. There are two possible cases:

29

· ZI = {z, z} consists of two sides of the toric diagram which are adjacent to the same corner p associated to the cut I. In that case, the sub semigroup of M generated by M + and -z, -z is the half lattice {  M |¯I()  0}, isomorphic with N × Z2. It gives then XZI:I = (C)2 × C; XZI:I is smooth, i.e. is equal to its crepant resolution XZI:I :

Xz:I,z:I = (C)2 × C

z:I,z:I (x) = (-L3/2 + 2L1/2 - L-1/2)

xn

(4.22)

n1

· ZI contains two sides of the toric diagram z, z which are not on the same corner of the toric diagram. In this case the sub semigroup of M generated by L+ and -z, -z is the whole lattice M isomorphic with Z3. This gives XZI:I = (C)3; XZI:I is smooth, i.e. is equal with its crepant resolution XZI:I :

X ZI :I = Xz:I,z:I = X I = (C)3

z:I,z:I (x) = I (x) = (-L3/2 + 3L1/2 - 3L-1/2 + L-3/2)

xn

n1

(4.23)

Proposition 4.5. Consider a side z of the toric diagram:

z:I (x) = (-L3/2 - (Kz - 2)L1/2 + (Kz - 1)L-1/2) xn + (-L1/2 + L-1/2)

isomorphism Xz:I We denote by (Q¯,

C2/ZKz × C at ) the quiver with

potential obtained from the toric threefold C2/ZKz × C: its nodes are Q¯0 = Z/KzZ, its arrows are ak : k  k,

bk : k  k + 1, ck : k + 1  k, and its potential is:

W¯ =

(akckbk - ak+1bkck)

kZ/Kz Z

(4.25)

We denote by A¯z:I the generating series of representations of (Q¯, W¯ ) such that the ak's are invertible. Starting with a representation V of (Q, W ) such that iQ0 viz is invertible, one can obtain a representation of (Q¯, W¯ ) such that the ak's are invertible by the following procedure:

· contract the strips Qk onto the single node k using the fact that all the arrows of Qk are isomorphisms. · Send the invertible cycles viz, for i  (Qk)0, to an invertible loop ak : k  k. · Send the arrows of Zigk : (Qk)0  (Qk+1)0 to bk : k  k + 1 · Send the arrows of Zagk : (Qk+1)0  (Qk)0 to ck : k + 1  k

This contraction, and the corresponding operation on the toric diagrams, are illustrated below for the case of the Pseudo-del Pezzo surface P dP3a:

The comparison of the potentials W and W¯ is quite tricky: for this reason, we will perform this contraction only after dimensional reduction. Consider z = zi-1/2, and denote by I the cut associated to the corner pi of the toric diagram. Denote by Q the dimensionaly reduced quiver with nodes (Q)0 = Q0, arrows (Q)1 = Q1 - I, and ideal of relation R = ((aW )aI )  CQ: the arrows of Q are given by the arrows in rr(Qeeldakut)ci1oendasnqdRu¯iivn=eZr(i(Qg¯akk ,+hf1aobvrkek-nobdkZae/skK)(kQz¯ZZ )/.0KC=z Zo)nZs/iKdCezrQZ¯t,h. aeWrcroeuwtwsI¯ilsloerfte((lQaQ¯t,e)W¯1th)=eg{giv(eeannke)rbkaytiZnt/hgKezsZear,ri(reboskw)Askzc:ZIk/:KatnzhZde}A,d¯wzim:Iitehunssiidinoegnaaltlholyef following schematic reasoning:

we will show that the contraction induces an ismomorphism between the moduli spaces of representation of the dimensionally reduced quivers.

Consider the arrows of I (resp

MzQ¯:,Id¯) is given by the pullback d-,10((MzQ:,Id)0) (resp d-¯,10((MzQ¯:I,d¯)0)). The assumption A.10 of [18] is satisfied,

i.e. we can apply the dimensional reduction formula from Theorem A.11 of [18]:

gauge groups acting on RQ,R,d (resp. RQ¯,R¯,d¯), and [] denotes the usual class monodromic mixed Hodge structure. The dimensional shift vanishes identically

in the Grothendieck group of for Q¯, and part ii) of lemma

4.1 shows that the dimensional shift vanishes also for dimension vectors for which MzQ:,IW,d is not empty, giving:

(4.27)

We now describe the contraction of the dimensionally reduced quiver with relation (Q, R) onto the dimensionally reduced quiver with relation (Q¯, R¯). We choose for each k a node ik  Qk0, an arrow (wk : jk  jk +1)  Zigk, and for each j  (Qk)0 a path (vizkj : ik  j)  CQk on Qk, and define the map

 :RQz:I,R,d= (V ) =

k d¯kzk  RQz¯:I,R¯ ,d¯

ak bk

= =

(vvizkizk+1jk +1 )-1wk vizkjk

(4.28)

where we use the fact that Vk and Vik are cannonically identified with Cd¯k . one obtains ak invertible, and ak+1bk = bkak from (2.17), i.e. (V ) is in RQz¯:I,R¯,d¯.

Now, consider a representation V¯ = (ak, bk)kZ/KzZ  RQz¯:I,R¯,d¯, and a representation V  RQz:I,R,d such that (V ) = V¯ . An arrow u : j  j of Qk can be written uniquely as

u = vizkj (vizk )mu (vizkj )-1 = vizkj am k u (vizkj )-1

(4.29)

31

for mu  Z. Consider an arrow w : j  j  Zigk. Because the two paths bk and (vizk+1j )-1wvizkj from ik to ik+1 cross one zig-zag path (those between Qk and Qk+1), they differ only by a power mw  Z of vizk = ak, i.e.

w

=

vz
ik+1

j



bk

am k w

(vizk

jk

)-1

(4.30)

In particular, all the arrows of Q are defined uniquely in terms of the vizkj once we have fixed the value of the ak and bk. Conversely, given arbitrary values of the vizkj the above expressions for u  Qk1, w  Zigk define a representation of RQz:,IR,d. So considering the group H := kZ/KzZ iQk0 -ik Gld¯k (notice that Gd  H × Gd¯, i.e. [H] = [Gd]/[Gd¯]), and the action:

H × -1(V¯ )  -1(V¯ ) (gj )jQ0 (gik = IdVik ) :

(u : j  j  Qk1 )  gj ugj-1 (w : j  j  Zigk)  gj wgj-1

(4.31)

we find that this action is free and transitive on -1(V¯ ) for any V¯ , i.e.  is an H-torsor. Because H is a special group, we have:

[RQz:I,R,d= k d¯kzk ] = [H ][RQz¯:I,R¯ ,d¯]



[RQz:I,R,d= ] k d¯kzk [Gd ]

=

[RQz¯:I,R¯ ,d¯] [Gd¯]

 Az:I (x) = A¯z:I ((xzk )k)

 z:I (x) = ¯ z:I ((xzk )k)

(4.32)

where we consider in the last line the generating series ¯ z:I (x) of BPS invariants for (Q¯, W¯ ) (notice that Az:I (x) lies in the center of the quantum affine space, and therefore is not subject to wall crossing). The
theorem 6.1 of [30] gives:

¯ ((xzk )k) = (-L3/2 - (Kz - 1)L1/2) xn - L1/2

xn+z[kk [

n1

k=k n0

(4.33)

We could compute ¯ z:I by doing a method similar as in [14], considering invertible/nilpotent decompositions and Jordan block decompositions. We prefer to show to extract ¯ z:I from ¯ using only formal manipulations, as an illutration of our formalism. We will prove the claim below:

¯ z:I (x)

=

[C] [C]

¯ (x)

(4.34)

This is related with the fact that ¯ z:I (x) (resp. ¯ (x)) is the generating series of BPS invariants for a noncommutative crepant resolution of C2/ZKz ×C(resp. of C2/ZKz ×C). Consider a generic stability  giving a crepant resolution (C2/ZKz × C) = (C2/ZKz ) × C, and remark that (C2/ZKz × C)z:I = (C2/ZKz ) × C, using lemma 2.11, one obtains for n  1:

¯ z:I (n, y) = -L3/2[(C2/ZKz ) × C]

¯ (n, y) = -L3/2[(C2/ZKz ) × C]

¯ z:I (n, y)

=

[C] [C]

¯ (n,

y)

(4.35)

We can show that the relation of the claim holds also for the other dimension vectors using invertible/nilpotent decompositions and duality properties for (Q¯, W¯ ). Denote by z, z, z the external edges of the toric diagram of C2/ZKz × C considered in the clockwise order. One has:

¯ z:I (x) = ¯ (x) - ¯ z:N (x)

¯ z:N (x) = ¯ z:N,z:N (x)

¯ z:N,z:N (x) = ¯ (x) - ¯ z:I,z:N (x) - ¯ z:I,z:I (x)

¯ z:I (x) = ¯ (x) - ¯ (x) + ¯ z:I,z:N (x) + ¯ z:I,z:I (x)

(4.36)

32

where in the first and the third lines we have performed invertible/nilpotent decompositions, and in the second line we have used corollary 3.10. We have Kz = Kz = 1, i.e. the BPS invariants ¯ z:I,z:N and ¯ z:I,z:I have only terms with dimension vector n, giving:

¯ zd:I =¯ d - ¯ d d  

=

[C] [C]

¯ d

d  

(4.37)

The last line holds because the BPS invariants are either 0 or -L1/2 for d   from (4.33). This ends the proof the claim (4.34), giving:

z:I (x) = ¯ z:I ((xzk )k)

4.3 Identities between partially nilpotent attractors invariants

We now have all the ingredients to express the BPS invariants  in terms of BPS invariants ZN :N with nilpotency contraints on a given cycles viz. Proposition 4.6. We can express, for [z, z] a strict subset of the set of sides of the toric diagram:

(x) =(-L3/2 - ( z~[z,z]Kz~ - 2)L1/2 + ( z~[z,z]Kz~ - 1)L-1/2)

n1

+ (-L1/2 + L-1/2)

xn+z[kk[ + N (x)

z k=k n0

(4.39) (4.40)

Proof:
We use proposition 4.4, which says that for non adjacent zi and z, zi:I,z:I = I . In particular, for z  [zi-1, zi+1] we have:

zi:I,zi+1:N,z:I = 0

zi :I ,[zi+1 ,zi-1 [:N

=

zi :I ,zi+1 :N


(4.41)

We have also:

zi :I ,[zi+1 ,zi-1 [:N

zi-1 :I ,zi :I ,[zi+1 ,zi-1 [:N

=zi:I,zi+1:N - zi-1:I,zi:I + I

where the two crossed terms cancel. Notice that the correction between the partially nilpotent invariants lie in the center of the quantum affine space, i.e. they are not subject to wall crossing: in particular, the same relations hold for the BPS invariants  at any generic stability , an then also for attractor invariants .
This formula gives an algorithmic way to compute BPS invariants, and in particular attractor invariants, by localization: we choose a slope s, and compute by localization the first terms of the generating series Zi[z,z]:N (x). From those we can extract by wall crossing the attractor invariants [z,z]:N (d, y) for small dimensions vectors d, and we use the formulas (4.39) to compute the full attractor invariants (d, y) for small dimensions vectors d. We can also compute algorithmically the true partition function Zi(x) by correcting the partition function Zi[z,z](x) obtained by localization:
Theorem 4.7. For a family of generic slopes s¯ = (sd)d such that lz~  L-  z~  [z, z], defining:

s¯(x) =

(4.49)

where we have used once more in the third line the fact that d sdxd lies in the center of the quantum affine space. We can then conclude using theorem 3.8.
Using the duality result of corollary 3.10, we are able to derive a universal formula expressing BPS invariants up to an unknown self-Poincar´e dual contribution:

35

Theorem 4.8.

(x) = (-L3/2 - (b - 3 + i)L1/2 - iL-1/2) xn - L1/2

xn+z[kk[ + sym(x)

n1

z k=k n0

(4.50)

with sym(x) self Poincar´e dual, and supported on dimension vectors d   . In particular, one has:

(x) = (-L3/2 - (b - 3 + i)L1/2 - iL-1/2) xn - L1/2

xn+z[kk[ + sym(x)

n1

z k=k n0

(4.51)

with sym(x) self Poincar´e dual, and supported on dimension vectors d  

Proof: We have shown in corollary 3.10 that the duality property [z,z[:N = [z,z[:N is true at least for a specific pair of sides of the toric diagram z, z. Using the formulas of proposition 4.6, we find that for any z, z:

(x) - [z,z[:N (x) = (N (x) - [z,z[:N (x))

(4.52)

We can deduce:

(x) = N (x) We have then, using again the formula of proposition 4.6:

(4.53)

(x) - (x) = (-L3/2 - (b - 3)L1/2 + (b - 3)L-1/2 + L-3/2) xn

n1

+ (-L1/2 + L-1/2)

x ) n+z[kk[

sym(x) := (x) - (-L3/2 - (b - 3 + i)L1/2 - iL-1/2) xn - L1/2

x  n+z[kk[

n1

z k=k n0

sym(x) = sym(x)

(4.54)

one obtains that sym is supported on dimension vectors d   from lemma 2.11. The same formula for (x) follows, by noticing that ,d = d,d for d a specific stability parameter.

For local curves, i.e. symmetric quivers corresponding to toric diagrams without interior lattice points, the BPS invariants (which do not depend on the stability , because the quantum affine space is commutative in this case) have been computed explicitly. We will check as an illustration the compatibility of those results with our formula. It appears in those cases that there can be dimension vectors with attractor invariants 1, and it is the only contribution to the symmetric part sym(x).

For toric diagrams with i  1 interior lattice points, the symmetric part sym(x) can be quite complicated, and in particular is subject to wall crossing. The attractor invariants are expected to be quite simpler. The simple representations, with dimension vectors ei, i  Q0, always contribute to the attractor invariants, with attractor invariant 1. A natural question is then whether there exist other dimension vectors for which the attractor invariants have a non-zero symmetric part sym(x). We conjecture, from some evidence in [16] and various computations in [2], that such dimension vectors do not exist:

Conjecture 4.9. For toric diagram with i  1 internal lattice points, the attractor invariants are given by:

(x) = xi + (-L3/2 - (b - 3 + i)L1/2 - iL-1/2) xn - L1/2

xn+z[kk [

(4.55)

4.4 Examples of attractor invariants
In this section, we compare our results with the known BPS invariants for local curves, i.e. for i = 0, and spell out our results and conjecture for local toric surfaces, i.e. for i = 1.

36

4.4.1 local curves
In those cases, the generating series were explicitly computed. Because the quantum affine space is commutative, there is no wall crossing, i.e. the BPS invariants are independant of .
· C3 The toric diagram of C3 is given by:

Every edge has only one subdivision, so our computation of the antisymmetric part of the attractor invariants gives:

(x) = -L3/2 xn + sym(x)
n1

(4.56)

In fact, labelling z, z, z the three edges of the toric diagram in the clockwise order, the two partition functions
Z±s computed from K-theoretic localization in [10] (see remark 3.2) correspond in our formalism respectively to the partition functions Ziz:N and Ziz:N,z:N , then equation (3.28) gives:

z:N (x) = -L1/2 xn

n1

z:N,z:N (x) = -L-1/2

xn

n1

(4.57)

Using the correction given in proposition 4.6, one obtains using any of these two localizations:

(x) = -L3/2 xn
n1

(4.58)

In perfect agreement with the result of [12] (the symmetric part vanishes in this case).

Each external edge of the toric diagram has two subdivisions. In green and red, we have written the zig-zag path corresponding with the edge z3/2 between p1 and p2. It divides the quiver into two subquivers Q0 and Q1, with nodes {0, 1} and {2, 3}. The two other external edges give zig-zag paths that are similar but rotated by an angle ±2/3, dividing the quiver respectively into subquivers with nodes {0, 3} and {1, 2}, resp. {0, 2} and {1, 3}. Our computation of the antisymmetric part of the attractor invariants gives (noting xi1i2...ir = xi1 xi2 ...xir ):

(x) = ((-L3/2 - 3L1/2)x - L1/2(x01 + x23 + x03 + x12 + x02 + x13)) xn + sym(x)
n0

(4.59)

Which is in agreement (with a symmetric correction this time) with the results of [31]:

(x) =((-L3/2 - 3L1/2)x - L1/2(x01 + x23 + x03 + x12 + x02 + x13) + 1(x0 + x1 + x2 + x3 + x123 + x230 + x301 + x012)) xn

· Other small crepants resolutions:
The other small crepant resolutions are resolutions of the zero locus of XY - ZN0W N1 in C4 corresponding with trapezoidal toric diagram with height 1, the lower edge of length N0, and the upper edge of length N1. A noncommutative resolution of this threefold is determined by a triangulation  of the toric diagram. The construction of the corresponding quiver and brane tiling is described in [32]. We enumerate triangles by Ti from the right to the left, for i  I = ZN , for N = N0 + N1 ( in particular b = N + 2), cyclicaly identifying the right external edge of the toric diagram with the left external edge of the toric diagram. The triangulation defines a bijection:

We define:

 = (x, y) : IN = {0, ..., N - 1}  (IN0 × {0})  (IN1 × {1})

(4.61)

J = {i  I|y(i) = y(i + 1)

(4.62)

which enumerates i  I such that triangles Ti and Ti+1 have adjoint horizontal edges (we consider triangles TN-1 and T0 for i = N - 1.

We construct then a quiver with nodes I, a pair of bidirectional arrows between successive nodes i, i + 1, and an edge loop at nodes of J. The corresponding brane tiling is obtained by cyclically stacking layers of the form:
iiiiii

if i  I - J, and of the form:

iiiiii

if i  I.
The zig-zag paths corresponding to the lower (resp. upper) edge of the toric diagram, denoted z0 (resp. z1) are given by the border between two two successive layers i - 1, i such that y(Ti) = 0 (resp. y(Ti) = 1).

As an example, consider the following triangulation, for N0 = 4, N1 = 2, N = 6:

We have  = ((3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 0), (0, 1)), I = Z6, J = {0, 1}. The corresponding brane tiling is:

Where we have drawn in red the zig-zag paths z1 = z3/2 corresponding to the upper edge between p1 in p2, and in blue the the zig-zag paths z0 = z-1/2 corresponding to the lower edge between p3 in p0.
We can use our evaluation of the antisymmetric part of the attractor invariants. To this aim we must find all the dimension vectors that are of the form z[kk[, for z a side of the toric diagram and k = k  Z/KzZ.
38

The left and right external edges of the toric diagram have only one subdivision, i.e. they do not give such roots. According to our description of zig-zag paths corresponding to the above and below side of the toric diagram, such a dimension vector is of the form d = ej + ej+1 + ... + el, l + 1 = j, (in particular it is in the set of real root r+e), such that the corresponding layers of the brane tiling lie between two zig-zag paths of z0 or two zig-zag paths of z1, i.e. such that y(Tj) = y(Tl+1). According to our definition of J, it is the case if and only if iJ di is even. We obtain:

(x) = (-L3/2 - (N - 1)L1/2)

xd - L1/2

xd + sym(x)

dr+e| iJ di even

(4.63)

4.4.2 Toric threefolds with compact divisors

· canonical bundle over toric Fano surfaces

In this case, the toric diagram has one internal lattice point and the only points on the boundary are the corners, i.e. external edges have only one subdivision. Our result gives then:

(x) = (-L3/2 - (b - 2)L1/2 - L-1/2) xn + sym(x)
n1

(4.65)

The arguments of [16] (that we hope to put on a firm mathematical ground), and explicit computations for small dimensions vectors done in [2], supports our conjectural formula 4.9:

· canonical bundle over toric weak Fano surfaces
In those cases, the toric diagram has one internal lattice point, and its external edges can have various number of subdivisions.
