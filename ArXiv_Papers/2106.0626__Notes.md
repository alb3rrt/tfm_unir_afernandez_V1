## Abstract

Microwave electromagnetic heating are widely used in many industrial processes. The mathematics involved is based on the Maxwell's equations coupled with the heat equation. The thermal conductivity is strongly dependent on the temperature, itself an unknown of the system of P.D.E. We propose here a model which simplifies this coupling using a nonlocal term as the source of heating. We prove that the corresponding mathematical initial-boundary value problem has solutions using the Schauder's fixed point theorem.
