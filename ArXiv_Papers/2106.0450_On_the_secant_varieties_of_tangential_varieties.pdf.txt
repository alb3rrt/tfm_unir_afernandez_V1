ON THE SECANT VARIETIES OF TANGENTIAL VARIETIES
EDOARDO BALLICO
Abstract. Let X  Pr be an integral and non-degenerate variety. Let a,b(X)  Pr, (a, b)  N2, be the join of a copies of X and b copies of the tangential variety of X. Using the classical Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem (case b = 0) and a recent paper by H. Abo and N. Vannieuwenhoven (case a = 0) we compute dim a,b(X) in many cases when X is the d-Veronese embedding of Pn. This is related to certain additive decompositions of homogeneous polynomials. We give a general theorem proving that dim 0,b(X) is the expected one when X = Y × P1 has a suitable Segre-Veronese style embedding in Pr. As a corollary we prove that if di  3, 1  i  n, and (d1 + 1)(d2 + 1)  38 the tangential variety of (P1)n embedded by |O(P1)n (d1, . . . , dn)| is not defective and a similar statement for Pn × P1. For an arbitrary X and an ample line bundle L on X we prove the existence of an integer k0 such that for all t  k0 the tangential variety of X with respect to |Lt| is not defective.

1. Introduction

For any integral and non-degenerate n-dimensional projective variety X  Pr defined over an

algebraically closed field K with characteristic 0 and any integer a > 0 the a-th secant variety

a(X) of X is the closure in Pr of the union of all linear subspaces of Pr spanned by a points of

X. Its expected dimension is min{r, a(n + 1) - 1} and by Terracini's lemma ([4, Corollary 1.11])

we may check if a(X) has the expected dimension using the integer h0(IZ (1)), where Z  X

is a certain zero-dimensional scheme. If each a(X) has the expected dimension we say that X is not defective. The tangential variety  (X)  X is the closure in Pr of the union of all TqX, q  Xreg, where TqX  Pr denote the Zariski tangent space of X at q. The variety  (X) has

dimension at most 2n and equality holds if and only if a general tangent space of X is tangent

only at finitely many points of X. A key observation made in [12] (and then used several times,

e.g. in [10]) is that to give dim b( (X)) it is sufficient to compute h0(IZ0,b (1)), where Z0,b is a certain zero-dimensional scheme with deg(Z0,b) = b(2n + 1). Any scheme Z0,1  Xreg is called a

tangential scheme. Using this idea H. Abo and N. Vannieuwenhoven proved a conjectural result of

[10]:

the description of all integers dim b( (X)), where X  Pr, r = -1 +

n+d n

, is the d-Veronese

embedding of Pn. As explained in [2, 10, 12] this result has an interpretation in terms of the

existence of a certain additive decomposition of a general homogeneous degree d polynomial in

n + 1 variables. For any (a, b)  N2 \ {(0, 0)} let a,b(X) denote the join of X copies of a and b copies of  (X) ([4]). The interpretation of dim  (X) as the integer r + 1 - h0(IZ0,1 (1)), where Z0,1
is a certain zero-dimensional subscheme of X with deg(Z0,1) = 2n + 1, and the Terracini's lemma for joins ([4, Corollary 1.11]) give dim a,b(X) = r - h0(IZa,b (1)), where Za,b  X is a certain
zero-dimensional scheme. Since Za,b is zero-dimensional and deg(Za,b) = a(n + 1) + (2n + 1)b, we have h0(IZa,b (1)) = r + 1 - a(n + 1) - b(2n + 1) + h1(IZa,b (1)). It is well-known that the
integer dim a,b(X) has an interpretation in terms of another related additive decomposition of homogeneous degree d polynomials. In particular a,b(X) = Pr if and only if for a general degree

d homogeneous polynomial f there are a + 2b homogeneous linear forms 1, . . . , a+2b such that

Theorem 1.1. Fix integers n  2, t  3. Let X  Pr, r =

n+t n

- 1, denote the order t Veronese

embedding

of

Pn.

Fix

(a, b)  N2

such

that

either

a

n+3 3

/(n + 1)

or

b



n+3 3

/(2n + 1).

Then either h1(IZa,b (t)) = 0 or h0(IZa,b (t)) = 0, except in the cases

(n, t, a, b)  {(2, 4, 5, 0), (2, 3, 0, 2), (3, 3, 3, 0), (3, 4, 9, 0), (3, 4, 7, 1), (4, 3, 7, 0), (4, 4, 9, 0)}.

For the quadruples (n, a, b, t) for which Theorem 1.1 may be applied, it gives that a general homogeneous polynomial f has a decomposition (1) for some 1, . . . , a+2b (case h0(IZa,b (t)) = 0), or the dimension of the set of the polynomials f in (1) for some 1, . . . , a+2b (case h1(IZa,b (t)) = 0).
For n = 2, 3, 4 we give all integers dim a,b(Pn) (Propositions 5.1 and 5.4). The exceptional cases with either a = 0 or b = 0 in the list of Theorem 1.1 have a well-
known geometric interpretation. The only case in this list with ab = 0 has an obvious geometric interpretation. Indeed, in P3 we have |IZ7,1 (4)| = {2Q}, where Q is the only quadric containing the 7 points which are the reduction of the 7 degree 4 connected components of Z7,1 and the tangent vector used to define the degree 7 connected component of Z7,1 (Proposition 5.4).
For more about additive decompositions of homogeneous polynomials and their use in applied
mathematics, see [17, 20] and the introduction of [2].

Theorem 1.2. Let Y be an integral projective variety, L  Pic(X) and V  H0(L) a linear

subspace inducing a rational map Y

P-1,  := dim V , with image Y  of dimension n - 1 =

dim Y . Assume that the tangential variety of Y  is not defective. Let C be an integral projective

curve, R  Pic(C) and W  H0(R) a linear subspace with dim W  4. Set n := 1 + dim Y

 := dim V and assume   4n2 + 2n - 4. Set X := Y × C. Then the tangential variety of X with

respect to V  W is not defective.

We explain with full details in Remark 2.5 the statement of Theorem 1.2. The reader may take Y  P(V ), C  P(W ) and then X embedded in P(V  W ) by the Segre embedding of P(V ) × P(W ) in P(V  W ).
As an immediate corollary of [13] and Theorem 1.2 obtained taking Y = (P1)n-1, V := H0(O(P1)n-1 (d1, . . . , dn-1)), C = P1 and W := H0(OP1 (dn)) we get the following result.
Corollary 1.3. Fix integers n  2 and di > 0, 1  i  n, such that di  3 for all i  3 and (d1 + 1)(d2 + 1)  38. Then the tangential variety of (P1)n with respect to H0(O(P1)n (d1, . . . , dn)) is not defective.

See [1, 3, 19] for the dimensions of the secant varieties of Segre-Veronese varieties. Theorem 1.2 has also the following immediate consequence for Pm × P1.

such

that

 4m2 + 10m + 2;

if m  4 assume d = 3. Then the tangential variety of the embedding of Pm × P1 by the complete

linear system |OPm×P1(d, t)| is not defective.

For the cases m  4, t = 3 and d = 1, 2, 3, see Propositions 4.1 and 4.2.

Remark 1.5. Take X := Pm × (P1)n-m, n > m > 0, embedded by the complete linear system

|OX (d1, . . . , dn-m+1)| with di  3 for all i and

m+d1 m

 4m2 + 10m + 2. By induction on n - m

we may apply Theorem 1.2 to X and get that the tangential variety of X is not defective.

We also prove the following asymptotic result which is similar to the very general [6] and whose proof uses their differential Horace lemma.

Theorem 1.6. Fix an integral projective variety X, line bundles M, L on X with L ample and a
zero-dimensional scheme W  X. There is an integer k0 such that for each integer k  k0 and all (a, b)  N2, either h0(IZa,b  M  Lk) = 0 or h1(IZa,b  M  Lk) = 0, where Za,b  X is a general union of a 2-points and b tangential schemes.

Since 0,1  2(X), a,b(X)  a+2b(X). If a,b(X) and a+2b(X) have the expected dimension
and dim a+2b(X) = (dim X +1)(a+2b)-1  N the variety a,b(X) has codimension b in a+2b(X)
and we would like to know its geometry. In particular a,1(X) seems to be an interesting divisor of the (usually very singular) variety a+2(X). Let a0,0b(X) denote the union of all linear spans of schemes Z which are disjoint unions of a 2-points and b tangential schemes of Xreg. For each q  a0,0b(X) let S(X, q, a, b) denote the set of all schemes Z  Xreg such that q  Z and Z is a

TANGENTIAL VARIETY

disjoint union of a 2-points and b tangential schemes. An obvious question (identifiability) is to ask
if |S(X, q, a, b)| = 1 for a generic q  a,b(X) (generic identifiability, often just called identifiability). One can also ask if |S(X, q, a, b)| = 1 for a particular q  a00,b(X) (specific identifiability) and to reconstruct the unique element of S(X, q, a, b).

1.1. Comments on the results and their proofs. As far as we know the more recent and

powerful versions of the Differential Horace Lemma are [15, 21, 22] which improve the very general

appendix of [6] (all of them are not limited to the fat point schemes associated to multiple points

and they apply to non-complete linear systems). The classical use of the differential Horace lemma

is an inductive procedure of the following type. Roughly speaking for any t  N it is defined a

certain statement Ht, one find a small integer k0 such that Hk0 is true (often the most difficult part), one prove that Hk implies Hk+1 for all k  k0 and then one prove that the proven Hk's plus a few small cases prove the big theorem you want to prove. The small cases are important for the

full statement, because among them there are the exceptional cases, but they are also important to

prove Hk0 . There is another top-down approach ([6, 7, 8], here used to prove Theorem 1.6) which goes like this. Suppose your theorem involves the line bundles Lt, t  N, all with h1(Lt) = 0.
There is a family Zt of zero-dimensional schemes such that to prove your theorem for Lt it is sufficient to prove that either h1(IZ  Lt) = 0 or h0(IZ  Lt) = 0 for all Z  Zt. We use
the differential Horace lemma with respect to an effective divisor D and see that it is sufficient

to prove that either h1(IZ  Lt-1) = 0 or h0(IZ  Lt-1) = 0, where Z is the differential

residue. But then (here usually quoting [14]) we see that there is a smaller Z1  Z for which

it is sufficient to prove that either h1(IZ1  Lt-1) = 0 or h0(IZ1  Lt-1)  deg(Z) - deg(Z1). Then we continue with Z1, not Z, and again applying differential Horace to Z1 we get first some

Z1 and then a smaller Z2 such that to conclude for Z and Lt it is sufficient to prove that either

h1(IZ2  Lt-2) = 0 or h0(IZ2  Lt-2)  deg(Z) - deg(Z1) + deg(Z1 ) - deg(Z2). And so on.

To win for (Lt, Z) h0(IZs  Lt-s) 

it is
s i=1

sufficient to deg(Zi-i) -

find some 0  s < deg(Zi) with Z0 :=

t such Z. In

that either many cases

h1(IZs  Lt-s) = 0 or ([6, 7, 8] and Theorem

1.6) using Remark 2.7 to get a very good upper bound for deg(Z)) we get Zs =  and hence

h1(IZs  Lt-s) = 0. Thus no need to prove Hk0 and the initial cases, we only need to see for

which t we are able to find s  t with small Zs. The exceptional cases may be done, e.g. using

a computer, by somebody else and after the asymptotic theory. Contrary to the usual use of the

differential Horace doing first the exceptional cases does not help to get the asymptotic result.

In [6, 7, 8] it was clear that to use mixed multiplicity drastically simplify the numerology (see

here Remark 2.7 for a tiny example of the simplification which can be obtained using the mixed

case, even if one is only interested in the case a = 0).

In this paper there are 3 different blocks of statements.

(i) Theorem 1.1 and Propositions 5.1, 5.4. This case use the classical differential Horace

lemma inductive proof, because in this case it works very well. All exceptional pure cases a = 0 or

b = 0 where known ([2, 6]) and the only exceptional case with ab = 0 is geometrically obvious and

with small degree and very low n. The case n = 2 (as all cases with an arbitrary integral surface

X as a reader of [9] may realize) are very easy if the induction may start. The cases n = 3, 4 (with

a few exceptional cases with b = 0 for low d) are easy, but using the explicit values of the integers

n+d n

for low n and low d (Propositions 5.1 and 5.4). Then the inductive proof by n is routine.

The interested reader may improve Theorem 1.1 taking both a and b a bit smaller. Here examples

done using a computer should be very useful to see what is reasonable to expect.

(ii) Theorem 1.2, Corollaries 1.3, 1.4 and Remark 1.5. This case is an hybrid: its proof is

stated as the classical differential Horace inductive proof, but its proof could be written top down.

In the corollaries C = P1, but we stress that the main theorem and the main idea is for an arbitrary

curve C. We fix a general o  C and we use the differential Horace lemma with respect to the

divisor Y × {o}. The interested reader consider the following problem.

Fix integral projective curves C1, . . . , Ck of arithmetic genus g1, . . . , gk. Find positive integers a1, . . . , ak (only depending on g1, . . . , gk and, say, ai  2gi + 1 for all i) such that for all integers d1, . . . , dk with di  ai and any line bundle Li of degree di on Ci the embedding of C1 × · · · × Ck by the complete linear system H0(L1)  · · ·  H0(Lk) has the property that its tangential variety
is not defective. To start the induction on the number k of factors one needs the initial cases and

hence one need to first give a proof for C1 × C2. The case of an integral surface X is easy (if

4

EDOARDO BALLICO

we know the initial cases) as hinted in [9]. In [7] and [8] we used from the literature this case for multiple points with multiplicities up to 4 and up to 5 respectively, and then we considered the case dim X = 3 and dim D = 2 (see [8, Lemma 7], which is the equivalent in that set-up of Remark 2.7). In all cases it is clear that the use of mixed multiplicity should drastically simplify the computations, even the one done by computer in [8]. Since pa(Ci) is allowed to be positive, we may arrive going down to a line bundle L on X such that h0(L) = 0 and h1(L) > 0. Since h0(L) - h0(IA  L) = h1(IA  L) - h1(L) for any zero-dimensional scheme Z, Z gives deg(Z) independent conditions to H0(L) if and only if h1(IZ  L) = h1(L).
(iii) Theorem 1.6. We believe that the theorem proved by J. Alexander and A. Hirschowitz in [6], i.e. the case of Theorem 1.6 without tangential schemes, is very strong and interesting, not just a consolation prize for not having a complete classification. To prove Theorem 1.6 we will follow their strategy (e.g. induction on n) and at the beginning of the proof we will explain a critical reduction step. We point out that even to prove it only for tangential schemes in the intermediate steps many 2-points occur and hence it is easier to prove the mixed case. The paper [6] is non just for 2-points but for points with arbitrary multiplicities, not necessary the same, with the only restriction that in the statement of the theorem it is prescribed a positive integer µ and all multiple points have multiplicities  µ. Even if at the beginning we claim a statement only for a general union of multiple points with the same multiplicity µ > 2 in the intermediate steps mixed multiplicities occur.
Fix p  Xreg. The scheme mp is defined by the isomorphism class of the pair (X, p). A tangential scheme Z with p as its reduction is uniquely determined by the isomorphism class of a triple (X, p, R), where R is a one-dimensional vector space of the tangent space of X at p. It is this intrinsic definition which makes possible statements and proofs for any X. Similarly, the tangent space (and hence the dimension) of osculating varieties is associated to zero-dimensional schemes uniquely determined by the isomorphism class of a triple (X, p, R), plus the order of osculation ([9]). Thus it is reasonable to suppose that Theorem 1.6 may be extended to the case of general unions of multiple points and osculating schemes, if we fix the maximum order of the multiple points and of the osculating points. Instead of (X, p, R) one could use (X, p, F ), where F is a partial flag of the vector space TpX.
1.2. Conclusions and further suggestions. We described the top-down way to use the general Horace method, without the need of initial cases to start the induction. Thus it can be done even in a case (e.g. for Theorem 1.2 for C with positive arithmetic genus g) where our feeling is that it is not possible to check by computer some cases, each of them depending on parameters (4g - 3 parameters for g  2, 2 for g = 1). But even in the case, like homogeneous varieties embedded by a homogeneous complete linear system, in which we need to check only finitely many cases the top-down approach as the advantage that the cases may be checked by another team after the theoretical part is done. For the theoretical part the mixed case (allowing 2-points) seems to simplify drastically the proof and we think that it may help to cut the cases to be verified by the computer (as here Remark 2.7, in [8], in particular using [8, Lemma 7]). We also asked the identifiability problem for a general q  a,b(X) and for specific q  a00,b(X). In (ii) and (iii) we raised other open questions.
We thank a referee for stimulating observations.
2. Preliminary lemmas
For any integral projective variety X, any L  Pic(X), any linear subspace V  H0(L) and any closed subscheme B  X set V (-B) := H0(IB  L)  V . Note that dim V means the dimension of V as a vector space and so if V = 0 the linear system on X associated to V has dimension dim V - 1. Obviously dim V (-B) = max{0, dim V - |B|} if (for a fixed V ) we take a general subset B  X with a prescribed number of points. We say that a scheme A  X is a tangent vector of X if A is a connected zero-dimensional scheme, deg(A) = 2 and A  Xreg. Since X is integral and we impose that the support of a tangent vector is a smooth point of X, the set of all tangent vectors of X is an irreducible quasi-projective variety of dimension 2(dim X) - 1. Moreover, for any integral subvariety T  X with T Sing(X) and dim T > 0 the set of all tangent vectors of X whose reduction is a point of T (resp. which are tangent vectors of Treg) is an irreducible variety of dimension dim T + dim X - 1 (resp. 2(dim T ) - 1).

For any projective scheme X, any effective Cartier divisor D of X and any closed subscheme

Z  X the residual scheme ResD(Z) of Z with respect to D is the closed subscheme of X with IZ : ID as its ideal sheaf. For any L  Pic(X) we have the residual exact sequence of coherent sheaves on X:

0  IResD(Z)  L(-D)  IZ  L  IZD  L|D  0

(2)

If Z is zero-dimensional, then deg(Z) = deg(Z  D) + deg(ResD(Z)).

Remark 2.1. Let X be an integral projective variety of dimension  2 and let D  X be an integral effective divisor, D = . Fix L  Pic(X) and a vector space V  H0(L). For a general
finite set S  D we have dim V (-S) = max{dim V (-D), dim V - |S|}.

Since we only work in characteristic zero, the following lemma is a particular case of [14].

Lemma 2.2. Let X be an integral projective variety of positive dimension, L  Pic(X) and V  H0(L) a linear subspace. Fix (x, y)  N2. Let Z  X be a general union of x points and y tangent vectors of X. Then dim V (-Z) = max{0, dim V - x - 2y}.

As in most papers using the Horace method we use several times the following obvious observation.

Remark 2.3. Let X be a projective scheme, L a line bundle on X and W  W  zero-dimensional subchemes of X. To prove that h0(IW   L) = 0 it is sufficient to prove that h0(IW  L) = 0. To prove that h1(IW  L) = 0 it is sufficient to prove that h1(IW   L) = 0
Lemma 2.4. Let X be an integral projective variety with dim X  2, D an integral divisor on X, D = , L a line bundle on X and V  H0(L) a linear subspace. Fix (x, y)  N2. Let Z  D be a general union of x points of D and y tangent vectors of D. Let V|D be the image of V in H0(D, L|D). Then:
(1) dim V|D = dim V - dim V (-D) and dim V - V (-Z) = min{dim V|D, x + 2y}. (2) We have dim V (-Z) = dim V - x - 2y (resp. V (-Z) = V (-D)) if dim V|D  x + 2y (resp.
dim V|D  x + 2y). (3) If V = W (-E) for some zero-dimensional scheme E  X and W  H0(L) is a linear
subspace, thene V|D = W|D(-E  D) and V (-D) = W (- ResD(E)).
Proof. The equality dim V|D = dim V - dim V (-D) is obvious and it implies the second assertion of (1) by Lemma 2.2 applied to D. Part (2) is a particular case of part (1). Part (1) follows from the residual exact sequence (2), because V (-Z) = V  H0(IZ  L).

Remark 2.5. Let V be a linear system on an integral projective curve Y . We claim that the join of an arbitrary number of copies of the tangential variety of the embedded curve Y  associated to V and an arbitrary number of copies of Y  has the expected dimension. Since we are in characteristic
zero, to prove this claim it is sufficient to prove that for any general finite set S = S1  S2  Yreg we have dim V (-Z) = max{0, dim V - 3|S1| - 2|S2|}, where Z is the effective Cartier divisor of Y with each point of S1 appearing with multiplicity 3 and each point of S2 appearing with multiplicity 2. This is true by [14].

Remark 2.6. Let X be an integral projective variety, L  Pic(X) and V  H0(L) a linear subspace such that the rational map f : X Pr, r := dim V - 1, has image of dimension n := dim(X).
Take a non-empty open subset U of X such that the rational map f defined by V is a morphism on U and f|U has injective differential. Call X  Pr the closure of f (U ) and V   H0(OX (1)) the image of the restriction map H0(OPr (1))  H0(OX (1)). We have dim V  = dim V . By Chevalley's theorem ([16, Exercises II.3.18, II.3.19]) there is a non-empty open subset U   X such that f (U )  U . Fix a  N. Let Z  X be a general union of a tangential schemes of X. Since Z is general, Z  U  and there is a (not uniquely determined) scheme Z  U such that f|U induces an isomorphism Z  Z. Note that dim V (-Z) = dim V (-Z). Thus we may check if the tangential variety of X with respect to V  and its secant varieties have the expected dimension
using X and V , although we do not have defined the tangential variety of the pair (X, V ). The
definition of a tangential scheme, Z1, of X only requires a point o  Xreg U and a one-dimensional
linear subspace of the tangent space of X at o, because the differential of f is injective at o.

Let X  Pr be an integral and non-degenerate n-dimensional variety. For any q  Xreg the Zariski tangent space TqX of X at q is the linear span of the degree n + 1 zero-dimensional scheme 2q  X with (Iq)2 as its ideal sheaf; we say that 2q is the 2-point with the point q as its reduction. We have (2q)red = {q}. Fix q  Xreg such that TqX Sing( (X)) (e.g. take a general q  X). Fix any p, p  TqX   (X)reg such that the line spanned by {q, p} contains p. We have Tp (X) = Tp (X) and these linear subspaces of Pr are the linear span of a certain degree 2n + 1 zero-dimensional scheme constructed using the tangent vector of X whose linear span is the line
containing {p, q}.
Now we fix an effective divisor D of X and q  Dreg  Xreg. We write 2q for the 2-point of X with q as its reduction and {2q, D} for the 2-point of D with q as its reduction. We have
2q  D = {2q, D} (as schemes) and ResD(2q) = {q}. We say that 2q has type (n, 1) with respect to D, because deg(D  2q) = n, deg(D  ResD(2q)) = 1 and ResD(ResD(2q)) = , but this is only a shorthand for a stronger information: not only D  2q has degree n, but it is {2q, D}.
Fix a closed subscheme W  X with q / Wred. A key tool introduced by J. Alexander and A. Hirschowitz ([5, 6]) is that to prove that W  A has a good cohomological property (e.g. for X  Pr that the linear span of W  A has the expected dimension) it is sufficient to prove it for a virtual scheme Aq with Aq  D = {q} and ResD(Aq) = {2q, D}. We say that the virtual scheme Aq has type (1, n) with respect to D, because its intersection with D has degree 1 and its residue with respect to D has degree n and it is contained in D; again this is only a shorthand, because
we use in an essential way that the residual scheme is {2q, D}.
Let Z  X be the degree 2n + 1 zero-dimensional scheme associated to a tangent vector v
which we called a tangential scheme. If v  D, then deg(D  Z) = 2n - 1, deg(ResD(Z)) = 2 and ResD(Z)  D. We say that Z has type (2n - 1, 2) with respect to D. This is only a shorthand, because we use that Z  D is the tangential scheme of D associated to the tangent vector v. If
vred  Dreg and v D, then Z  D = {2q, D}, ResD(Z)  D = {2q, D} and ResD(ResD(Z)) = {q}. In this case we say that Z has type (n, n, 1) with respect to D. A key observation in [12] is that
we may extend the differential Horace and see that to handle the Hilbert function of W  Z1 for a general tangential scheme Z1 of X it is sufficient to handle the Hilbert function of W  Z with Z a virtual scheme with Z  D a tangent vector v of D at q and ResD(Z) the tangential scheme of D associated to v. We say that Z has type (2, 2n - 1) with respect to D.

Remark 2.7. Let X be an integral projective variety and L a line bundle on X such that h1(L) =
0. Set n := dim X. For all (a, b)  N2 let Za,b denote a general union of a 2-points and b tangential schemes. Suppose you want to prove that for each (a, b)  N2 either h0(IZa,b  L) = 0 or h1(IZa,b  L) = 0. By Remark 2.3 it is sufficient to test all (a, b)  N such that

h0(L) - n  a(n + 1) + b(2n + 1)  h0(L) + 2n.

However, we can do better. Fix (a, b)  N2 satisfying (3). Since h1(L) = 0, the case (a, b) = (0, 0) need not be tested. First assume b > 0 and a(n + 1) + b(2n + 1)  h0(L) + n. Since a general
tangent scheme contains a general 2-point, to test (a, b) it is sufficient to test (a + 1, b - 1). If b = 0 and a(n + 1)  h0(L) + n + 1 it is sufficient to test (a - 1, 0). Thus it is sufficient to test all (a, b) such that either b = 0 and h0(L) - n  a(n + 1)  h0(L) + n or

b > 0, h0(L) - n  a(n + 1) + b(2n + 1)  h0(L) + n - 1.

(4)

If a(n + 1) + b(2n + 1) = h0(L) - n and a > 0, we may avoid to test (a, b) if we test the more difficult case (a - 1, b + 1). Conversely, if a > 0, a(n + 1) + b(2n + 1) = h0(L) - n and (a, b) is an exeptional case, then (a - 1, b + 1) is an exceptional case.
With minimal modifications this observation may be extended to a case in which there is a small finite set   N2 such that for all (a, b)   we do not know if h0(IZa,b  L) · h1(IZa,b  L) = 0.

3. Proof of Theorem 1.2 and its corollaries
Let Y be an integral projective variety and C an integral projective curve. Set n := dim(Y ) + 1 and X := Y × C. Call 1 : X  Y and 2 : X  C the projections. For all L  Pic(Y ) and R  Pic(C) set L  R := 1(L)  2(R)  Pic(X). Ku¨nneth gives H0(L  R) = H0(L)  H0(R). Thus for all linear subspaces V  H0(L), W  H0(R), V  W := 1(V )  2(W ) is a linear subspace of H0(L  R) with dim V  W = (dim V )(dim W ). Taking instead of Y its image by

TANGENTIAL VARIETY

the linear system associated to V (Remark 2.6) we may assume that V induces an embedding of Y into P-1,  := dim V . Fix a general o  C. Since we are in characteristic zero and o is general, o is not an osculating point of C with respect to the linear system associated to W . Thus dim W (-xo) = max{0, dim W - x} for all x  N. Set D := Y × {o}. For each t  N set V [t] := V  W (-(dim W - t - 1)o). We have dim V [t] = (t + 1) · dim V and V [0] = V up to the identification of Y with D given by 1|D.
Notation 3.1. For each a  N let Za (resp. Wa) denote a general union of a tangential schemes of X (resp. D). Set  := dim V and a1 := /(2n - 1). Write  = (2n - 1)a1 + µ with 0  µ  2n - 2. Write  = (2n - 1)f1 + 2e1 with f1 = a1 and e1 = µ/2 if µ is even and f1 = a1 - 1 and e1 = n + (µ - 1)/2 if µ is odd. Since µ  2n - 2, we have e1  2n - 2. The pair (f1, e1) is the only pair (x, y)  Z2 such that (2n - 1)x + 2y =  and 0  y  2n - 2.

We make the following assumption £: Assumption £: For all a  N the vector space V (-Wa) has the expected dimension
max{0,  - (2n - 1)a}. By Assumption £ we have dim V (-Wa) =  - a(2n - 1) if a  a1 and V (-Wa) = 0 if a > a1.

Lemma 3.2. We have dim V [0](-Za) = max{0,  - (2n - 1)a}.

Proof. Take any tangential scheme Z  X. The scheme 1(Z) has degree at most 2n - 1 and it has degree 2n - 1 if and only if the tangent vector v used to define Z is not a tangent vector of the
fiber of 2 at the point 2(Zred), i.e. if and only if 1(Z) is a tangential scheme of Y . Use £.

Lemma 3.3. Set x1 := /(2n + 1) and 1 :=  - (2n + 1)x1. (a) We have dim V [1](-Za) = 2 - (2n + 1)a for all a  2x1. (b) If a  2/(2n + 1), then V [1](-Za) = 0. (c) If (2n + 1)a  2 + 2n + 2, then V [1](-Za) = 0. (d) We have dim V [1](-Z2x1+1)  max{0, 1 - 2}.
Proof. By Remark 2.3 to prove part (a) it is sufficient to do the case a = 2x1. We specialize Z2x1 to a general W1 := W W  with W a general union of x1 schemes of type (2n- 1, 2) with respect to D and W  a general union of x1 virtual schemes of type (2, 2n - 1) with respect to D. Since D  W1 is a general union of x1 tangential schemes of D and x1 tangent vector of D and   (2n + 1)x1, the assumption £ and Remark 2.1 give dim V [0](-W1  D) =  - deg(W1  D). Since ResD(W1) is a general union of x1 tangent vectors of D and x1 tangential schemes of D, we get part (a).
To get part (b) instead of W1 we use a general union of /(2n + 1) schemes of type (2n - 1, 2) with respect to D and a general union of /(2n + 1) schemes of type (2, 2n - 1) with respect to D. Note that x1 + 1  /(2n + 1). Thus by part (b) to check part (c) it is sufficient to observe that (2x1 + 1)(2n + 1)  2 + 2n + 1 and hence the assumption of (c) gives a  2x1 + 2.
To get part (d) we specialize Z2x1+1 to a general union of x1 + 1 schemes of type (2n - 1, 2) with respect to D and x1 schemes of type (2, 2n - 1) with respect to D.

Lemma 3.4. Assume n  3 and   (n + 1)(2n - 1); if n = 3 and µ > 0 assume a1  9 - 2µ. (a) If (2n + 1)a  3 - µ, then dim V [2](-Za) = 3 - (2n + 1)a. (b) If (2n + 1)a  3 + 2n - 1 - µ, then dim V [2](-Za) = 0.

Proof. The assumption   (n + 1)(2n - 1) is equivalent to a1  n + 1.

of type (2n - 1, 2) with respect to D. By £ we have dim V [0](-W  D) =  - (2n - 1)a1. Thus

it is sufficient to prove that V [1](- ResD(W1)) has the expected dimension. We have ResD(W1) =

Za-a1 ResD(W ) with ResD(W ) a general union of a1 tangent vectors of D. Note that (2n+1)(a-

a1)  3 - µ -  + µ - 2a1 = 2 - 2a1. Since a1  n + 1, we have (2n + 1)(a - a1)  2 - 2n - 2.

Thus a-a1 is not the unique integer, 2x1 +1, which is not covered either in part (a) or in part (b) of

Lemma 3.3. Since (2n+1)(a-a1)  2, parts (a) and (b) of Lemma 3.3 give that V [1](-Za-a1) has

the expected dimension, 2 - (2n + 1)(a - a1). Since D  Za-a1 =  and deg(ResD(W )) = 2a1  ,

to prove part (a) using Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to check that 2a1   (true because 2n - 1  2

for n  3) and that dim V [0](-Za-a1)  max{0, 2 - (2n + 1)(a - a1) - 2a1}. By £ we have

dim V [0](-Za-a1) = max{0,  - (2n - 1)(a - a1)}. Thus we may assume a - a1  a1. In this

8

case we have dim V [0](-Za-a1) =  - (2n - 1)(a - a1). Thus we conclude, unless a  2a1 and 2- (2n + 1)(a - a1)- 2a1  -1 + - (2n - 1)(a - a1), i.e. a  2a1 and + 1  2(a - a1)+ 2a1 = 2a

and in particular   4a1 - 1. We get (2n - 1) < 4 and hence n = 2.

We specialize Za to W2 := Za-a1-1  W , where W  is a general union of a1 + 1 schemes of

type (2n - 1, 2) with respect to D. By £ we have V [0](-W  D) = 0 and so it is sufficient to

prove that V [1](- ResD(W2)) = 0. By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that V [1](-Za-a1-1) has the expected dimension and that V [0](-Za-a1-1) = 0. For V [1] we only need to check that a - a1 - 1  2x1 (Lemma 3.3), i.e. (2n + 1)(a - a1 - 1)  2. Since (2n + 1)a  3 + 4n - 1 - µ,

to check V [1] we only need that 3 + 4n - 1 - µ - 2a1 -  + µ - 2n - 1  2, i.e. it is sufficient

to have n + 1  a1. For V [0] we need that either µ = 0 and a - a1  a1 or a - a1 - 1  a1 + 1.

Since a  ((6n - 3)a1 + 2µ + 2n - 1)/(2n + 1), we have a  2a1 + 2 if (4n + 2)a1 + 4n + 2 

(6n - 3)a1 + 2µ + 2n - 1, which is true if n  4 and a1  n + 1 or n = 3 and a1  9 - 2µ.

Lemma 3.5. Assume n  3 and   (n + 1)(2n - 1); if n = 3 and µ > 0 assume a1  9 - 2µ. Fix z  N and let Z = Zz  W  X with W a general union of e1 tangential schemes of D. Assume (2n + 1)z + (2n - 1)e1  3 -  with  = 3 if µ = 2 and  = 0 otherwise. Then dim V [2](-Z) = 3 - deg(Z).

Proof. Note that µ = 0 if and only if e1 = 0 and that µ = 2 if and only if e1 = 1. By Lemma 3.4 we may assume µ = 0. By Remark 2.3 we may assume x  f1. To prove part (a) we specialize Zz to Zz-f1 A. Since deg(D(AW )) = , V [0](-D(AW )) = 0 and deg(ResD(A))  , by Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that V [1](-Zz-f1) = 2 - (2n + 1)(z - f1) and that dim V [0](-Zz-f1)  max{0, 2-deg(Zz-f1 ResD(A))}. By Lemma 3.3 to prove that V [1](-Zz-f1) = 2-(2n+1)(z - f1) it is sufficient to prove that z - f1  2/(2n + 1). Since (2n + 1) + 2(2n + 1)/(2n + 1)  (2n+ 1)+ 2(2n+ 1)(- 2n)/(2n+ 1) = 2- 2n, it is sufficient to prove that (2n+ 1)z - (2n+ 1)f1  2 - 2n, i.e. (2n + 1)z  (6n - 3)f1 + 4e1 - 2n. By assumption we have (2n + 1)z + (2n - 1)e1  (6n - 3)f1 + 6e1 - , i.e. (2n + 1)z  (6n - 3)f1 + (7 - 2n)e1 - . We have (2n - 3)e1  2n -  because either e1  2 or e1 = 1 = µ/2.
We have V [0](-Zz-f1) if either z - f1  a1 + 1 or µ = 0 and z - f1  a1. However, if z - f1  a1, we have dim V [0](-Zz-f1) =  - (2n - 1)(z - f1) and so to handle V [0] we may assume z - f1  a1 and use that   2(z - f1) + 2f1 (this is true, because n  3).
Lemma 3.6. Assume n  3 and   4n2 + 2n - 4. For any a  N Za has the expected dimension with respect to V [3].

Proof. By Remark 2.3 it is sufficient to do the cases a  {4/(2n + 1), 4/(2n + 1)} and in
particular we may assume f1 + e1  a  (4[(2n - 1)f1 + 2e1] + 2n)/(2n + 1). We specialize Za to Za-f1-e1  W  W  with W a general union of f1 schemes of type (2n - 1, 2) with respect to D and e1 schemes of type (2, 2n - 1) with respect to D. By £ and Lemma 2.2 it is sufficient to prove that Za-f1-e1 ResD(W )ResD(W ) imposes independent conditions to V [2]. Since deg(D(Za-f1-e1  ResD(W )  ResD(W )))  , by Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that dim V [2](-(Za-e1-f1  ResD(W ))) = 3 - (2n + 1)(a - e1 - f1) - (2n - 1)e1 and that dim V [1](-Za-e1-f1 )  max{0, 3 - (2n+1)(a-e1-f1)-2e1}. To prove the assertion about V [2] using Lemma 3.5 it is sufficient to prove that deg(Za-f1-e1  ResD(W ))  3 - . Since Za-f1-e1  ResD(W ) has degree (2n + 1)a +  - 2f1 when  = 0 it is sufficient to observe that (2a + 1)a  4 + 2n and that f1  n. Now assume  = 3, i.e. µ = 2 and e1 = 1. In this case f1 = a1 = ( - 2)/(2n - 1)  n + 3.
Now we consider V [1]. Since dim V [2] - dim V [1] = , to conclude by Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that dim V [1](-Za-e1-f1 )  dim V [2] - deg(Za-f1-e1  ResD(W )  ResD(W )). We have deg(Za-f1-e1 ResD(W )ResD(W )) = (2n+1)a-. We are done if either V [1](-Za-e1-f1 ) = 0 or dim V [1](-Za-e1-f1 ) = 2 deg(Za-e1-f1 ). Thus by Lemma 3.3 we may assume a-e1-f1 = 2x1 +1 and dim V [1](-Za-e1-f1 )  max{0, 1 - 2}. It is sufficient to have   max{0, 1 - 2} + 2f1 + (2n - 1)e1, i.e. (2n - 3)f1  (2n - 3)e1 + max{0, 1 - 2}. Since 1  2n, it is sufficient to have (2n - 3)f1  (2n - 3)e1 + 2n - 2. Since n  3, it is sufficient to have f1  e1 + 2. Since e1  2n - 2, it is sufficient to assume   (2n - 1)2n + 2(2n - 2) = 4n2 + 2n - 4.

Lemma 3.7. Take the assumptions of Lemma 3.6. Let B  D be a general union of e1 tangential schemes of D. For any a  N Za  B gives the expected number of conditions to V [3].

TANGENTIAL VARIETY

Proof. First assume (2n+1)a+(2n-1)e1  4. By Remark 2.3 we may assume (2n+1)a  4-2n. We specialize Za  B to Za-f1-e1  W  W   B with W a general union of f1 - e1 schemes of type (2n - 1, 2) with respect to D and e1 schemes of type (2, 2n - 1) with respect to D. By £ and Lemma 2.2 it is sufficient to prove that Za-f1  ResD(W )  ResD(W ) imposes independent conditions to V [2]. Then we continue as in the proof of Lemma 3.6.

We will prove simultaneously Theorem 1.2 and the next lemma.
Lemma 3.8. Fix an integer t  3. Let B  D be a general union of e1 tangential schemes of D. For any a  N Za  B gives the expected number of conditions to V [t].
Proof of Theorem 1.2 and Lemma 3.8: The theorem (resp. Lemma 3.8) is true for t = 3 by Lemma 3.6 (resp. Lemma 3.7). Thus we may assume t  4 and that both results holds for V [x] for all x such that 3  x  t - 1. Fix a  N.
Take first the set-up of Theorem 1.2. We specialize Za to a general M := Za-f1-e1  W  W  with W a general union of f1 schemes of type (2n - 1, 2) with respect to D and W  a general union of e1 schemes of type (2, 2n - 1) with respect to D. We have deg(M  D) = . By £ and Lemma 2.2 we have V [0](-M  D) = 0. Thus it is sufficient to prove that Za-f1-e1  ResD(W )  ResD(W ) imposes min{t, deg(Za-f1-e1  ResD(W )  ResD(W ))} conditions to V [t - 1]. Note that (t + 1) - deg(Za) = t - deg(Za-f1-e1  ResD(W )  ResD(W )). Since ResD(W ) is a general union of f1 tangent vectors of D and deg(D  ResD(W )  ResD(W ))  , by Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that Za-f1-e1  ResD(W ) gives the expected number of conditions to V [t - 1] (true by the inductive assumption for Lemma 3.8) and that dim V [t - 2](-Za-f1-e1)  max{0, t - (2n + 1)(a - f1 - e1) - (2n - 1)e1 - 2f1}. If t  5 we use the inductive assumption of the theorem and that   (2n - 1)e1 + 2f1, i.e. f1  e1 (true because e1  3n - 3 and   (2n + 1)(4n - 3)). Now assume t = 4. We have deg(Za)- deg(Za-f1-e1 ) =  + (2n - 1)e1 + 2f1. If (2n + 1)a  5 = (10n - 5)f1 + 10e1 we need to prove V [2](-Za-f1-e1 ) = 0 and so it is sufficient to have (2n + 1)(a - f1 - e1)  3 + 2n - 1 - µ = (6n - 3)f1 + 6e1 + 2n - 1 - µ. Hence it is sufficient to have (2n - 3)f1  (2n - 5)e1 + 2n - 1 - µ. Since 2f1  2n, it is sufficient to have f1  e1, which (since e1  2n - 2) it is true if   (2n + 1)(2n - 2).
Now we handle Lemma 3.8. We specialize B  Za to M  := B  Za-f1+e1  W1  W2 with W1 a general union of f1 - e1 schemes of type (2n - 1, 2) with respect to D and W  a general union of e1 schemes of type (2, 2n - 1) with respect to D. Taking ResD we land in the case done for the proof of the theorem, except that a may be different and we only have f1 - e1 tangent vectors. For t = 4 to handle V [2] we need the following computations.
First assume (2n + 1)a + (2n - 1)e1  5, i.e. (2n + 1)a  (10n - 5)f1 + (11 - 2n)e1. We we have to prove that V [2](Za-f1+e1 ) = 0. By Lemma 3.3 it is sufficient to prove that (2n+1)(a-f1 +e1)  (6n - 3)f1 + 6e1 + 2n + 2. Thus it is sufficient to have (10n - 5)f1 + (11 - 2n)e1  (8n - 4)f1 + (5 - 2n)e1 + 2n + 2, i.e. (2n - 1)f1 + 6e1  2n + 2, which is obviously true. If (2n + 1)a < 5, it is sufficient to do the case with (2n + 1)a  5 - 2n. Use that (2n - 1)f1 + 6e1  4n + 2.

Proof of Corollary 1.3: A stronger statement is true for n = 2 by [13]. The case n > 2 follows by induction on n by Theorem 1.2 applied to Y := (P1)n-1, V := H0(O(P1)n-1 (d1, . . . , dn-1)).

In this section we prove the following proposition.
Proposition 4.1. The tangential variety of Pm × P1, m  4, with respect to |OPm×P1(x, 3)| is not defective for x = 2, 3.
We fix o  P1 and set D := Pm × {o}. For any positive integer x set Zx := Z0,x. We warm up with the following easy result.
Proposition 4.2. Fix an integer m > 0 and set X = Pm × P1. We have h1(IZ1 (1, 3)) = h0(IZ2 (1, 3)) = 0.

10

EDOARDO BALLICO

Proof. We use induction on m, the case m = 1 being true by [13]. Take m > 1 and set M := Pm-1×P1  |OX (1, 0)|. We specialize Z2 (resp. Z1) to a general union A of two (resp. one) schemes of type (2n-1, 2) with respect to M . The inductive assumption gives h0(M, IAM (1, 3)) = 0 (resp. h1(IAM (1, 3)) = 0). Since E := ResM (A) is a general union of two (resp. one) tangent vectors of M , hi(IE (0, 1)) = 0, i = 0, 1 (resp. h1(IE (0, 1)) = 0).
Lemma 4.3. Set Y := P1 and X := P1 × P1. Let A  X be a general union of Z2 and one 2-point. Then h1(IA(3, 2)) = 0.
Proof. We specialize A to a general union B of a scheme of type (2, 2, 1) with respect to D = Y ×{o} and a scheme of type (2, 1). We have hi(D, IDB(3, x)) = 0, i = 0, 1, x  N, and ResD(B) is a general union of one 2-point of X with support on D and a point of D. Since ResD(ResD(B)) is a point and h1(D, IDResD(B)(3, x)) = 0, x  N, we conclude.
Lemma 4.4. Set Y := P1 and X := P2 × P1. Let A  X be a general union of one tangential scheme and one 2-point. Then h1(IA(1, 3)) = 0.
Proof. We specialize A to a general union B of a scheme of type (2, 2, 1) with respect to D := Y ×{o} and a scheme of type (2, 1). We have hi(D, IDB(3, x)) = 0, i = 0, 1, x  N, and ResD(B) is a general union of one 2-point of X with support on D and a point of D. Since ResD(ResD(B)) is a point and h1(D, IDResD(B)(3, x)) = 0, x  N, we conclude.
Lemma 4.5. Take X = P2 × P1, fix a line H  P2 and set M := H × P1. Let A  X be a general 2-point with Ared  M . Then h0(IZ1A(1, 3)) = 1.
Proof. We specialize Z1 to a scheme W of type (5, 2) with respect to M . Since ResM (W  A) is a general union of a tangent vector of M and a point of M , h0(IResM (W )(0, 3)) = 1. Thus it is sufficient to prove that h0(M, IM(W A)(1, 3))  1. Take L  |OM (0, 1)|. We specialize A  M to a 2-point A of L whose reduction is a general point of M . Taking ResL we get h0(M, IM(W A)(1, 3)) = h0(M, I(MW ){p}(1, 2)) = 0 ([13] applied to the tangential scheme M  W and Lemma 2.4).
Lemma 4.6. Set Y := P1 and X := P1 × P1. Let A  X be a general union of Z2 and one 2-point. Then h1(IA(3, 2)) = 0.
Proof. We specialize A to a general union B of a scheme of type (2, 2, 1) with respect to D := Y ×{o} and a scheme of type (2, 1). We have hi(D, IDB(3, x)) = 0, i = 0, 1, x  N, and ResD(B) is a general union of a 2-point of X with support on D and a point of D. Since ResD(ResD(B)) is a point and h1(D, IDResD(B)(3, x)) = 0, x  N, we conclude.
Lemma 4.7. Set X := P1 × P1. Let A  X be a general union of one tangential point and one 2-point. Then h0(IA(2, 3)) = 4.
Proof. By [13] we have h1(IZ2 (2, 3)) = 0. Since Z2  A, we get h1(IA(2, 3)) = 0.
Lemma 4.8. Set X := P2 × P1 and M = P1 × P1. Let B  X be a general 2-point of X with Bred  M . Then h1(IZ1B(1, 3)) = 0.
Proof. We specialize Z1 to a scheme A of type (5, 2) with respect to M . Since ResM (A) is a general tangent vector of M , its image by the projection onto the second factor of X is a tangent vector of P1. Thus h0(IResM (AB)(0, 3)) = 2. Thus it is sufficient to show that hi(M, IAM (1, 3)) = 0, i = 0, 1. Fix o  P1 and set D := P1 × {o}. We specialize A  M to a union G of a 2-points whose reduction is in D and a general tangential point F of M . The scheme ResD(G) is the union of F and a general point of D. Thus ResD(G) gives independent conditions for H0(OM (1, 2)), because the tangential point gives 5 independent conditions to H0(OM (1, 2)) ([13]) and 4 conditions to H0(OM (1, 1)).
Lemma 4.9. Set X := P2 × P1 and M := P1 × P1. Let A  X be a general union of Z2 and the scheme E of type (3, 3) with respect to M with both E  M and ResM (E) a 2-point of M . Then h0(IA(2, 3))  6.

Proof. We have h0(OX (2, 3)) = 24 and h0(OM (2, 3)) = 12. We specialize A to Z1  W  E with W a scheme of type (5, 2) with respect to M . Since h0(M, IW M (2, 3)) = 4 (Lemma 4.7), it is sufficient to prove that h0(IZ1ResM (W )ResM (E)(1, 3))  2. Since ResM (W ) is a general tangent vector of M and deg(D  (ResM (W )  ResM (E))  8 , by Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that h0(IZ1 (0, 3))  2. We have h0(IZ1 (0, 3)) = 1, because a tangential scheme of P1 imposes 3 independent conditions to H0(OP1 (3)). We have h0(IZ1ResM (W )(1, 3))  4 by Lemma 4.8.
Lemma 4.10. Set X := P2 × P1. Then h0(IZ2 (1, 3)) = 0.
Proof. We have h1(IZ1 (1, 3)) = 0, i.e. h0(IZ1 (1, 3)) = 2. Use that a general tangent vector is contained in a general tangential scheme.
Lemma 4.11. Set X := P2 × P1 and M := P1 × P1  |OX (1, 0)|. Let A  M be a general 2-point of M . Then h1(IZ2A(2, 3)) = 0.
Proof. We specialize Z2 to Z1  B with B a scheme of type (5, 2) with respect to M . We have h1(M, I(BM)A(2, 3)) = 0, because by [13] two general tangential schemes of M give 10 independent conditions to H0(OM (2, 3)). Thus it is sufficient to prove that h1(IZ1E(1, 3)) = 0, where E = ResM (B) is a general tangent vector of M , i.e. it is sufficient to prove that h0(IZ1E(1, 3)) = 3. Since deg(E)  6, by Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to observe that h1(IZ1 (1, 3)) = 0 and that h0(IZ1 (0, 3))  3 (we have h0(IZ1 (0, 3)) = 1).
Lemma 4.12. Set X := P2 × P1. Let B  X be a general union of 5 tangential schemes and one 2-scheme. Then h1(IB(3, 3)) = 0 and h0(IB(3, 3)) = 1.
Proof. Since deg(B) = 39 = h0(OX (3, 3)) - 1, the two assertions are equivalent. Set M := P1 × P1 seen as an element of |OX (1, 0)|. We have h0(OM (3, 3)) = 16. We specialize B to a scheme Z2  A with A general union of 3 schemes of type (5, 2) with respect to M and a scheme type (1, 3) with respect to M . Since M  A is a general union of 3 tangential schemes of M and one point, by [13] we have hi(M, IMA(3, 3)) = 0, i = 0, 1. Thus it is sufficient to prove that ResM (A)  Z2 imposes independent conditions to H0(OX (2, 3)). The scheme ResM (A) is a general union of one 2-point of M , A, and 3 general tangent vectors of M . By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that h1(IZ2A(2, 3)) = 0 (true by Lemma 4.11) and that h0(IZ2 (1, 3))  h0(OM (2, 3)) - deg(Z2  A  E)) = 1 (true by Lemma 4.10).
Lemma 4.13. Set X := P3 × P1 and M := P2 × P1  |OX (1, 0)|. Let A  X be a general 2-point of X with Ared  M and B a scheme of type (4, 4) with respect to M such that B  M = ResM (B) is one 2-point of M . Then h0(IZ2AB(2, 3))  10.
Proof. Take N  |OM (1, 0)|, N = P1 × P1. Claim 1: Let F  N be a general union of one tangential scheme and two 2-points. Then
h1(N, IF (2, 3)) = 0. Proof of Claim 1: Fix L  |ON (1, 0)|. We specialize F to a general union G of a tangential
scheme and two 2-points with reduction contained in L. We have hi(L, IGL(2, 3)) = 0, i = 0, 1. We have h1(N, IResL(G)(1, 3)) = 0 by [13] and Lemma 2.4.
We specialize Z2 to a general union U of two schemes of type (7, 2) with respect to M . Thus M  (U  A  B) is a general union of two tangential schemes of M , one 2-point of M and one point of M .
Claim 2: h1(M, IM(UAB)(2, 3)) = 0. Proof of Claim 2: We specialize U  A  B to the union U  of a tangential scheme, a scheme of type (5, 2) with respect to N and two 2-points with reduction contained in N . By Claim 1 we have h1(N, IUN (2, 3)) = 0. The scheme ResN (U ) is a general union of one tangential scheme, a general tangent vector of N and two points of N . By Lemma 2.4 we have h1(IResN (U)(1, 3)) = 0, proving Claim 2. Since ResM (U  A  B) is a general union of 2 tangent vectors of M , one point of M and one 2-point of M and h0(OX (1, 3)) - h0(OX (0, 3)) = h0(OM (1, 3)) = 12, we get the lemma.
Lemma 4.14. Take Y := P4, X := Y × P1, D := P4 × {o} and V := H0(OP4 (3)). Then dim V [3](-Z12) = dim V [3] - deg(Z12) and V [3](-Z13) = 0.

EDOARDO BALLICO

Proof. We recall ([10, 12]) that dim V = 35, 3 general tangential points of Y give independent
conditions to V , but 4 not. We specialize Zx, x  {12, 13}, to the union of Zx-6 and the union A of 3 schemes of type (9, 2) with respect to D and 3 schemes of type (2, 9) with respect to D. Since hi(D, IDA(3)) = 0, i = 0, 1, by Lemma 2.2 it is sufficient to prove that Z6  ResD(A) gives independent conditions to V [2] and that V [2](-(Z7  ResD(A)) = 0. Let B  D be a general union of 3 tangential schemes of D. By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that Z6  B gives independent conditions to V [2], that dim V [1](-Z6)  6, that dim V [2](-(Z7  B))  6 and that V [1](-Z7) = 0. To control V [2] we specialize Zx-6  B to Zx-9  B  E with E a general union of 3 schemes of type (9, 2), use that hi(I(DE)B(3)) = 0, i = 0, 1, and then use again Lemma 3. To prove that V [1](-Z6) = 0 we specialize Z6 to a general union of 3 schemes of type (9, 2) and 3
schemes of type (2, 3).

Proof of Proposition 4.1: Since the case m = 1 is true by [13], we may assume m  2. Fix a

hyperplane

H



Pm

and

set

M

:=

H ×P1

and

X

:=

Pm ×P1.

We

have h0(OX (x, y))

=

(y +1)

m+x m

for all (x, y)  N2. A tangential scheme of X (resp. M ) has degree 2m + 3 (resp. 2m + 1). We

write Zx for a general union of x tangential schemes of X.

(a) Take m = 2.

(a1) Consider |OX (2, 3)|. We have h0(OX (2, 3)) = 24 and h0(OM (2, 3)) = 12. To prove that
h1(IZ3 (2, 3)) = 0 we specialize Z3 to Z1  W with W a general union of 2 schemes of type (5, 2) with respect to M . We have h1(M, IW M (2, 3)) = 0 by [13] and hence it is sufficient to prove that h1(IZ1ResM (W )(1, 3)) = 0. Since h1(IZ1 (1, 3)) = 0, h0(IZ1 (0, 3)) = 4 - 3 and ResM (W ) is a
general union of 2 tangent vectors of M , it is sufficient to apply Lemma 2.4.

To get that h0(IZ4 (2, 3)) = 0 we specialize Z4 to Z1 W W  with W as above and W  a scheme of type (3, 3, 1) with respect to M . It is sufficient to prove that h0(IZ1ResM (W )ResM (W )(1, 3)) = 0.
By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that h0(IZ1ResM (W )(1, 3))  2 (true by Lemma 4.5) and h0(IZ1ResM (ResM (W ))(0, 3)) = 0 (true, because ResM (ResM (W )) is a general point of M and so deg(2(Z1  ResM (ResM (W )))) = 4).
(a2) Consider |OP2×P1(3, 3)|. We have h0(OX (3, 3)) = 40 and h0(OM (3, 3)) = 16. To prove that h1(IZ5 (3, 3)) = 0 we specialize Z5 to Z2  A with A a general union of 3 schemes of type (5, 2) with respect to M . Since h1(M, IAM (3, 3)) = 0 ([13]), it is sufficient to prove that
h1(IZ2E(2, 3)) = 0, where E is a general union of 2 tangent vectors. By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to use that h1(IZ2 (2, 3)) = 0 (step (a1)) and that h0(IZ2 (1, 3)) = 0 (Proposition 4.2). To prove that h0(IZ6 (3, 3)) = 0 we specialize Z6 to Z2  A  A with A a general union of 3 schemes of type (5, 2) with respect to M and A a scheme of type (1, 3, 3) with respect to M . We have

h1(M, IAM (3, 3)) = 0, i = 0, 1, by [13]. The scheme ResM (A) is a general union of 3 tangent

vectors of M and a scheme E of type (3, 3) with respect to M such that E  M and ResM (E) are 2-points of M . We have h0(IZ2ResM (E)(1, 3))  2 by Lemma 4.4. By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that h0(IZ2E(2, 3))  6, which is true by Lemma 4.9.
(b) Take m = 3. Thus a tangential scheme has degree 9.

(b1) We have h0(OX (2, 3)) = 40 and h0(OM (2, 3)) = 24. To prove that h1(IZ4 (2, 3)) = 0
we specialize Z4 to Z1  W with W a general union of 3 schemes of type (7, 2) with respect to M . We have h1(M, IW M (2, 3)) = 0 by step (a2) and hence it is sufficient to prove that h1(IZ1ResM(W )(1, 3)) = 0. By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to observe that h1(IZ1 (1, 3)) = 0 (Proposition 4.2) and that 1 = h0(IZ1 (0, 3))  5 = max{0, h0(OX (1, 3)) - deg(Z1  ResM (W ))}.
(b2) We have h0(OX (3, 3)) = 80 and h0(OM (3, 3)) = 40. To prove that h0(IZ9 (3, 3)) = 0
we specialize Z9 to Z2  A with A a general union of 5 schemes of type (7, 2) with respect to M ,

one scheme of type (4, 4, 1) with respect to M and one scheme of type (1, 4, 4) with respect to

M . We have hi(M, IAM (3, 3)) = 0, i = 0, 1, by Lemma 4.12. Thus it is sufficient to prove that h0(IZ2EF G(2, 3)) = 0, where E is a general union of 5 tangent schemes of M , F has type (4, 1)
with respect to M and G has type (4, 4) with respect to M (both G  M and ResM (G) are 2-points
of M . By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that h0(IZ2ResM (F )ResM (G)(2, 3))  10 (true by Lemma 4.13) and that h0(IZ2 (1, 3)) = 0 (true by the case m = 3 of Proposition 4.2).
The proof that h1(IZ8 (3, 3)) = 0, i.e. that h0(IX (3, 3)) = 8 is easier; it may be done with minimal modifications to the proof that h0(IZ9 (3, 3)) = 0, but we prefer to show that it follows from the statement that Z9 imposes 92 - 1 conditions to H0(OX (3, 3)). Indeed, it first implies that h0(IZ7 (3, 3)) = 4 · 20 - 7 × 9 and then that the addition of 2 general Z1 gives 17 independent

TANGENTIAL VARIETY

13

conditions to H0(IZ7 (3, 3)). Thus adding the first Z1 must give 9 independent conditions to H0(IZ7 (3, 3)).
(c) Take m = 4. Thus a tangential scheme has degree 11. Fix a hyperplane H of M and a hyperplane H of H and set N := H × P1 and N  := H × P1. We have h0(ON (3, 3)) = 40 and h0(ON (3, 3)) = 16. Let O  N  be a general union of 3 tangential schemes of N . By [13] we have h1(N , IO (3, 3)) = 0.
Claim 1: Let O  N be a general union of 5 tangential schemes of N and one 2-point of N . Then h1(N, IO(3, 3)) = 0.
Proof of Claim 1: We specialize O to A1  A2 with A1 a general union of 2 tangential schemes of N and one 2-point of N and A2 is a general union of 3 schemes of of type (5, 2) with respect to N . We just proved that h1(N , IA2N(3, 3)) = 0. By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that h1(N, IA1 (2, 3)) = 0 and that h0(N, IA1 (1, 3)) = 0. We have h1(N, IA1 (2, 3)) = 0 by step (a1), because A1 is contained in a general union of 3 tangential schemes of N . We have h0(N, IA1 (1, 3)) = 0 by Proposition 4.2, because A1 contains a general union of 2 tangential schemes of N .
(c1) We have h0(OX (2, 3)) = 60 and h0(OM (2, 3)) = 40. To prove that h1(IZ5 (2, 3)) = 0 we specialize Z5 to Z1  E with E a general union of 4 schemes of type (9, 2) with respect to M . By step (b1) and Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to observe that h1(IZ1 (1, 3)) = 0 (Proposition 4.2) and that 1 = h0(IZ1 (0, 3))  1 = max{0, h0(OX (1, 3)) - deg(Z1) - deg(ResM (E))}.
(c2) We have h0(OX (3, 3)) = 140 and h0(OM (3, 3)) = 80. Claim 2: Let K  M be a general union of 8 tangential schemes of M and one 2-point of M . Then h1(M, IK (3, 3)) = 0. Proof of Claim 2: We specialize K to B1  B2  B3 with B1 a general union of 3 tangential schemes of M , B2 a scheme of type (4, 1) with respect to N and B3 a general union of 5 schemes of type (7, 5) with respect to N . Claim 1 gives h1(N, IB2N (3, 3) = 0. By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that h1(M, IB1 (2, 3)) = 0 (true by step (a)) and that h0(M, IB1 (1, 3)) = 0 (true by Proposition 4.2). To prove that h1(M, IB1 (2, 3)) = 0 To prove that h1(IZ12 (3, 3)) = 0 we specialize Z12 to Z = Z3  F  G with F a general union of 8 schemes of type (9, 2) with respect to M and G a scheme of type (5, 5, 1) with respect to M . By Claim 2 we have h1(M, IZM (3, 3)) = 0. The scheme ResM (Z) is a general union of Z3 and U := ResM (G) (which is a 2-point of X whose reduction is a general p  M ). By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove h1(IZ3U (2, 3)) = 0 and h0(IZ3{p}(1, 3)) = 0 (true by Proposition 4.2). To prove that h1(IZ3U (2, 3)) = 0 we specialize Z3 U ; we are allowed to use step (c1), because Z3 U is projectively equivalent to a subscheme of a general union of 4 tangential schemes of X.
5. Joins of the varieties and its tangent developable
For any X, L  Pic(X) and V  H0(L) consider the following Assumption ££ which the pair
(X, V ) may have:
Assumption ££: For a general union Z of finitely many tangential schemes of X and finitely many 2-points of X the linear system V (-Z) has the expected dimension max{ - deg(Z), 0}.
Some of the statements of section 3 may be improved (allowing a lower ) if V has ££. In this section (except Lemmas 5.2 and 5.3) we take X = Pn for some n and V = H0(OX (t)). Let Za,b denote a general union of a 2-points and b tangential schemes of X.
Proposition 5.1. Take X = P2. We have h1(IZa,b (t)) · h0(IZa,b (t)) = 0 if and only if (t, a, b)  {(2, 2, 0), (4, 5, 0), (3, 0, 2)}, with  := h1(IZa,b (t)) = h0(IZa,b (t)) = 1 in each case and with |IZa,b (t)| either a multiple line or (case (4, 5, 0)) a multiple conic.
Proof. We obviously have h0(IZa,b (1)) = 0 if (a, b) = (0, 0). The set |IZ2,0 (2)| is the double line containing (Z2,0)red and in this case we have  = 1. Obviously h0(IZa,b (2)) = 0 if either a+b  3 or a + b = 2 and b > 0. We have h1(IZ0,1 (2)) = 0 ([12]). For t  3 we know that the only exceptional cases (t, a, b) with either a = 0 or b = 0 are (4, 5, 0) (with  = 1 and |IZ5,0 (4)| = 2C with C the smooth conic containing (Z5,0)red) and (3, 0, 2) (with  = 1, the only element of |IZ0,2 (3)| being the triple line spanned by (Z0,2)red). We only check the cases ab = 0. Fix a line L  P2.
(a) Take t = 3. We specialize Za,b to E := Za-1,b-1  A  B with A a scheme of type (2, 2, 1) with respect to H (i.e. A is a general tangential scheme with Ared  H) and B of type (2, 1) with

14

EDOARDO BALLICO

respect to H. Since hi(H, IEH (3)) = 0, i = 1, 2, it is sufficient to prove that ResH (E) gives the expected number of conditions to H0(OP2 (2)). Since ResH (B) is a general point of H, by Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that h0(IZa-1,b-1ResH(ResL(A))(1))  max{0, 6 - 3(a - 1) - 5(b - 1) - 1}
(obvious) and that Za-1,b-1  ResH (A) gives the expected number of conditions to H0(OP2 (2)). We conclude, unless (a, b) = (2, 1). In this case we specialize Z2,1 to E := Z0,1 B with B general

union of two schemes of type (2, 1) with respect to H. By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to observe

that h1(IZ0,1 (2)) = h0(IZ0,1 (1)) = 0. (b) Take t = 4. We specialize Za,b to F := Za-1,b-1  M1  M2 with M1 a scheme of type

(3, 2) with respect to H and M2 a scheme of type (2, 1) with respect to H. By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that h0(IZa-1,b-1 (2))  max{0, 10 - 3(a - 1) - 5(b - 1) - 3} (obvious even when (a - 1, b - 1) = (2, 0)) and that Za-1,b-1 gives the expect number of conditions to H0(OP2 (3))

(true by the case t = 3, unless (a - 1, b - 1) = (0, 2)). Now assume a = 1 and b = 3. Since

h0(IZ0,3 (4)) = 1 ([12]), we have h0(IZ1,3 (4)) = 0 (c) Assume t  5 and that in the use of Lemma 2.4 we do not land in one of the exceptional

cases with t = 3, 4 (for which see step (d)). By Remark 2.7 we may assume 3a + 5b 

t+2 2

- 2.

Write 3x + 2y = t + 1 with y  {0, 1, 2}. If b  x and a  y (resp. b > x and a < y, i.e. a = 1

and y = 2) we specialize Za,b to F := Za-y,b-x  A  B (resp. F  := Z0,b-x-1  A  B  B) with

A a general union of x schemes of type (3, 2) with respect to H, B a general union of y schemes

of type (2, 1), B a scheme of type (2, 1) and B a scheme of type (2, 3) with respect to H. By

Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that h0(IZa-y,b-x (t - 2))  max{0,

t+1 2

- 3(a - y) - 5(b - x) -

2x - y}, which is true by the inductive assumption if (t - 2, a - y, b - x) is not an exceptional

case (resp.

h0(IZ0,b-x-1 (t - 2))  max{0,

t+1 2

- 5(b - x - 1) - 2x - 1 - 3}) and that Za-y,b-x

(resp. Z0,b-x-1  ResH (B)) gives the expected number of conditions to H0(OP2 (t - 1)). The

first check is true, unless (t - 1, a - y, b - x) is in one of the exceptional cases. For the check of

the " resp. " part we use the following trick. If h0(IZ0,b-x-1 (t - 1)) = 0, then we are done. If

h0(IZ0,b-x-1 (t - 1)) = 0, then by the inductive assumption (note that (t - 1, 0, b) = (3, 0, 2) because

t  5) we get h1(IZ0,b-x-1 (t - 1)) = 0. Since 3 + 5b 

t+2 2

- 2, the inductive assumption gives

h0(IZ0,b-x-1 (t - 2)) = 0 (note that (t - 2, 0, b - x - 1) = (3, 0, 3) if t = 5, because in this case we

have y = 0). Thus the residual exact sequence of H:

0  I (t Z0,b-x-1 - 2)  I (t Z0,b-x-1ResH (B) - 1)  IResH (B),H (t - 1)  0

shows that we are done if the degree 3 scheme ResH (B) gives the expected number of conditions

to some (non-complete) linear system on H. This is a very particular case of [14], since the support

of ResH (B) is a general point of H and dim H = 1.

Now assume b < x. Write t + 1 = 3b + 2y1 + y2 with y1  N and y2  {0, 1}. Since 3a + 5b 

t+2 2

- 2, we have a  y1 + y2.

We degenerate Za,b to G := Za-y1-y2  M3  M4 with M3 a general

union of y1 schemes of type (2, 1) with respect to H and M4 a general union of y2 schemes of type

(1, 2) with respect to H. By Lemma 2.4 we conclude by the inductive assumptions unless t = 5, 6

and Z0,b-y1-y2 is an exceptional case for H0(OP2 (4)).

(d) Now assume t = 5, 6 and that in step (c) we landed in an exceptional case for OP2(t - 1) or

OP2(t - 2). If we landed in an exceptional case for OP2(t - 1), then t = 5 and we were considering

some Za,b with a = 5 and b = 0. For t = 5 we have (x, y) = (3, 0). Thus 1  b  2. First assume

b b

= =

2. We get a = a and 1 we specialize Z5,1 to

so G

a = 5, = Z2,1

3·5+5·2 >  G with G

23 =

7 2

+ 2, contradicting our assumption. If

a general union of 3 schemes of type (2, 1) with

respect to H and conclude by Lemma 2.4.

Now assume that we landed in an exceptional case for OP2(t - 2) (and hence 5  t  6). In each of the exceptional cases the defect, , is 1. Thus we only need to observe that in each of these

cases we applied Lemma 2.4 to a scheme W with deg(W  H) < t.

Lemma 5.2. Take X = P1 × P1. We have h0(IZ7,1 (4, 4)) = 0.
Proof. Fix D  |OX (0, 1)|. We specialize Z7,1 to Z6,0  A  B with A a scheme of type (3, 2) with respect to D and B a scheme of type (2, 1) with respect to Q. By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that h1(IZ6,0 (4, 3)) = 0 (true by [18]) and h0(IZ6,0 (4, 2)) = 0 (true because [18] implies h0(IZ5,0 (4, 2)) = 1).
Lemma 5.3. Take X = P1 × P1. We have hi(IZ5,2 (4, 4)) = 0, i = 0, 1.

TANGENTIAL VARIETY

15

Proof. Since deg(Z5,2) = 25, we have h0(IZ5,2 (4, 4)) = h1(IZ5,2 (4, 4)). Fix D  |OX (0, 1)|. We
specialize Z5,2 to Z4,1  A  B with A of type (3, 2) with respect to D and B of type (2, 1) with respect to D. By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that h1(IZ4,1 (4, 3)) = 0 and that h0(IZ4,1 (4, 2))  max{0, h0(OX (4, 3)) - deg(ResD(Z5,2))} = 1 (obvious because h0(IZ5,0 (4, 1)) = 1 by [18]). To prove that h1(IZ4,1 (4, 3)) = 0 we specialize Z4,1 to Z3,0  A  B with A, B as above and use that h1(IZ3,0 (4, 2)) = 0 and h0(IZ3,0 (4, 1)) = 1 ([18]).

Proposition 5.4. Take X := P3. If t  3 for any (a, b)  N2 Za,b gives the expected number of conditions to H0(OX (t)), except in the following cases:
(1) t = 3, a = 0, b = 3; we have |IZ0,3 (3)| = 3M , where M is the plane spanned by (Z0,3)red and h1(IZ0,3 (3)) = 2;
(2) t = 4, a = 9, b = 0; we have |IZ0,3 (3)| = 2Q, where Q is the smooth quadric containing (Z9,0)red and h1(IZ0,3 (3)) = 2;
(3) t = 4, a = 7, b = 1; we have |IZ0,3 (3)| = 2Q, where Q is the smooth quadric containing the 7 points (Z7,0)red and the tangent vector used to define Z0,1; hence h1(IZ0,3 (3)) = 1.

Proof. The exceptional cases with either a = 0 or b = 0 are known by the Alexander-Hirschowitz

theorem and [10, 12]. Outside these exceptional cases we only need to test (a, b) with a > 0,

b > 0 and |4a + 7b -

t+3 3

|



3.

We first check that if t = 4 we have h0(IZ7,1 (4)) = 1 with

|IZ7,1 (4)| = {2Q}, where Q is the only quadric containing the 7 points appearing with multiplicity

1 in Z7,1 and the tangent vector v defining the tangential scheme defining the tangential scheme of

Z7,1. We have 2Q  |IZ7,1 (4)| and Q is smooth, because the union of these 7 points and the tangent

vector is a general of 7 points and a general tangent vector. Note that Z7,1  Q is a general union of

a tangential scheme of Q and 7 2-points of Q. By Lemma 5.2 we have h0(Q, IZ7,1Q(4)) = 0. The

scheme ResQ(Z7,1) is a general union of 7 points and one tangent vector and hence it is contained in

a unique quadric. Since it is also contained in Q, we get |IZ7,1 (4)| = 2Q and hence h1(IZ7,1 (4)) = 1.

(a) Assume t = 3 and (a, b) = (0, 3). Since h0(IZ0,4 (3)) = h0(IZ1,3 (3)) = 0 (the only element

of |IZ0,3 (3)| is a triple plane), we may assume 1  b  2.

First assume b = 2. To get h1(IZ1,2 (3)) = 0 we specialize Z1,3 to E := Z0,1  W  W  with W of type (5, 2) with respect to H and W  of type (3, 1) with respect to H. By Proposition 5.1 we have

h1(H, IH(W W )(3)) = 0. By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that h1(I0,1(2)) = 0 (true by [12]) and that h0(IZ0,1 (1)) = 0 (obvious). To prove that h0(IZ2,2 (3)) = 0 we specialize Z2,2 to Z0,1 W  W  W  with W  of type (3, 1) with respect to H. We first use that h0(H, IH(W W W )(3)) = 0
(Proposition 5.1) and then use Lemma 2.4 as in the case (a, b) = (1, 2) just done.

Now assume b = 1. To prove that h1(IZ3,1 (3)) = 0 (i.e. h0(IZ3,1 (3)) = 1 and hence h0(IZ4,1 (3)) = 0) we specialize Z3,1 to Z0,1  M1 with M1 a general union of 3 schemes of type (3, 1) with respect

to H and then use the Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem in H and Lemma 2.4.

(b) Assume t = 4 and (a, b) / {(9, 0), (7, 1)}.

First assume b  3. We specialize Za,b to Za,b-3  W with W a general union of 3 schemes of

type (5, 2) with respect to H. We first apply Proposition 5.1 and then Lemma 2.4.

Now assume b = 2. To prove that h1(IZ5,2 (4)) = 0 it is sufficient to prove that |IZ5,2 (4)| = 2Q, where Q is the only quadric surface (it is a smooth quadric surface) containing the 5 points of

(Z5,0)red and the two tangent vectors used to define the two tangential schemes of Z5,2. To prove

that Q =

|IZ5,2 P1 ×

(4)| = 2Q it P1 and Z5,2

is sufficient to prove that h0(Q, IZ5,2Q(4)) = 0 (true by Lemma 5.3, because  Q is a general union of 2 tangential schemes of Q and 5 2-points of Q).

Since h0(IZ5,2 (4)) = 1, we have h0(IZa,2 (4)) = 0 for all a  6.

Now assume b = 1. Since h0(IZ7,1 (4)) = h1(IZ7,1 (4)) = 1, obviously h0(IZa,1 (4)) = 0 for all

a  8, but it is also easy to check that h1(IZ6,1 (4)) = 0 in the following way. Let x be the maximal

integer  6 such that h1(IZx,1(4)) = 0. Note that h1(IZ7,1 (4))  7 - x.

(c) Assume t  5. We work by induction on t (as in the proof of Proposition 5.1), because

for t = 5 taking ResH we never land in an exceptional case.

Proof of Theorem 1.1: Propositions 5.1 and 5.4 cover the cases n = 2, 3.
(a) Assume n = 4. We do here the cases t = 4, 5, 6, because the inductive proof done in steps (c) and (d) works verbatim. We have h0(OP3(3)) = 20, h0(OP3(4)) = 35, h0(OP3 (5)) = 56,

h0(OP3 (6)) = 84, h0(OP4 (2)) = 15, h0(OP4 (3)) = 35, h0(OP4 (4)) = 70, h0(OP4 (5)) = 126 and h0(OP4(6)) = 210. By assumption either a  7 or b  4.
(a1) Assume t = 4, b  4 and a  3. We specialize Za,b to Za-1,b-4  W  M  N with W

a general union of 3 schemes of type (7, 2) with respect to H, M is a scheme of type (2, 7) with

respect to H and N is a scheme of type (4, 1) with respect to H. In H we apply Proposition 5.4

with (t, a, b) = (4, 3, 3) and Lemma 2.2. Then we use Lemma 2.4.

(a2) Assume t = 4 and b = 2. To prove that h1(IZ8,2 (4)) = 0 (resp. h0(IZ9,2 (4)) = 0) it is sufficient to specialize Z8,2 to Z4,0  W1  W2 (resp. Z4,0  W1  W2  W3) with W1 a general

union of 3 schemes of type (7, 2) with respect to H, W2 a general union of 3 schemes of type

(4, 1), W3 a scheme of type (4, 1) with respect to H and then apply first Proposition 5.4 and

then Lemma 2.4.

Note that

8 4

- deg(Z8,2) = 3  2 =

- deg(H  (W1  W2)) and that

deg(H  (W1  W2  W3)) = 2 = deg(Z9,3) -

the first degeneration would send Zx,2, x  {8, 9}, in a configuration with both h0 = 0 and h1 = 0.

(a3) Assume t = 4 and b = 1. To prove that h1(IZ12,2 (4)) = 0 (i.e. h0(IZ12,2 (4)) = 1

and so h0(IZ13,2 (4)) = 0) we degenerate Z12,1 to Z4,0  M2  M3 with M3 a a scheme of type

(2, 7) with respect to H and M3 a general union of 8 schemes of type (4, 1) with respect to H.

We apply Proposition 5.4 to the intersection with H and then we apply Lemma 2.4. Note that

8 4

- deg(Z12,1) = 1 =

7 4

- deg(H (M2 M3)).

To prove h1(IZ4,0ResH(M2)(3)) = 0 it is sufficient

to note that that (since Z4,0 is not related to H) Z4,0  ResH (M2) is projectively equivalent to a

subscheme of some Z4,1.

Claim 1: On P4 we have h1(IZ4,1 (3)) = 0.

Proof of Claim 1: We degenerate Z4,1 to Z1,0  M4  M5 with M4 a scheme of type (7, 2)

with respect to H and M5 a general union of 3 schemes of type (4, 1) with respect to H. We use

Proposition 5.4 and Lemma 2.4.

(a4) Assume t = 5. It is sufficient to test all a, b such that 122  5a + 9b  130. After each

degeneration we use Proposition 5.4 for t = 5, Lemma 2.4 and the cases t = 3, 4 just done. If

a  14 (and in particular if b  3) we degenerate Za,b to Za-14,b  M6 with M6 a general union of 14 schemes of type (4, 1) with respect to H. If b  8 we degenerate Za,b to Za,b-8  M7 with M7 a general union of 8 schemes of type (7, 2) with respect to H. If 4  b  7 (and hence a  7) we

degenerate Za,b to Za-4,b-7  M8  M9 with M8 a general union of 4 schemes of type (7, 2) with respect to H and M9 a general union of 7 schemes of type (4, 1) with respect to H.
(a5) Assume t = 6. It is sufficient to test all a, b such that 5a + 9b  206. After each

degeneration we use Proposition 5.4 for t = 6 and Lemma 2.4. If a  21 (and in particular if

b  3) we degenerate Za,b to Za-21,b  N1 with N1 a general union of 21 schemes of type (4, 1) with respect to H. If b  12 we degenerate Za,b to Za,b-12  N2 with N2 a general union of 12 schemes of type (7, 2) with respect to H. If 4  b  7 we degenerate Za,b to Za-7,b-4  N3  N4

with N3 a general union of 4 schemes of type (7, 2) with respect to H and N4 a general union of 7 schemes of type (4, 1) with respect to H.

(b) Assume n = 5. The case t = 3 is true by our assumptions on a, b, the Alexander-

Hirschowitz theorem and [12, 10]. We do here the cases t = 4, 5 (which require the case t = 4 in H = P4) because the inductive proof done in steps (c) and (d) works verbatim. We have

h0(OP5(2)) = 21, h0(OP5 (3)) = 56, h0(OP5(4)) = 140, h0(OP5(5)) = 266. By assumption either a  10 or b  6.

(b1) Assume t = 4. By [10] we may assume a > 0. We may assume 6a + 11b  135. If a  14

(and in particular if b  4) we degenerate Za,b to Za-14,bN5 with N5 a general union of 14 schemes of type (5, 1) with respect to H. If b  5 and a  5 we degenerate Za,b to Za-5,b-5  N6  N7 with N7 a general union of 7 schemes of type (9, 2) with respect to H and N8 a general union of 5 schemes of type (5, 1) with respect to H. If 1  a  4 (and hence b  8) we degenerate Za,b to Za-1,b-8  N9  O1  O2 with N9 a general union of 7 schemes of type (9, 2) with respect to H, O1

a scheme of type (2, 9) with respect to H and O2 a scheme of type (5, 1) with respect to H. (b2) Assume t = 5. We may assume 6a + 11b  261. After each degeneration we use the case

n = 4 and t = 5 done in step (a2) and Lemma 2.4. If b  14 we degenerate Za,b to Za,b-14  O3 with O3 a general union of 14 schemes of type (9, 2) with respect to H. If 4  b  13 (and hence a  18) we degenerate Za,b to Za,b-14  O4  O5 with O5 a general union of 4 schemes of type (9, 2) with respect to H and O5 a general union of 13 schemes of type (5, 1) with respect to H. If

b  3 (and hence a  26) we degenerate Za,b to to Za-26,b  O6  O7 with O6 a general union of 25 schemes of type (5, 1) with respect to H and O7 a scheme of type (1, 5) with respect to H.
(c) By steps (a) and (b) we may assume n  6 and that the theorem is true for Pn-1. By

Remark refstu1 we may reduce the proof of the theorem (preserving the assumption max{(n +

1)a, (2n + 1)b} 

n+3 3

)

Assume

There

are

x, y

such

that

(2n - 1)x + 2y

=

n+t-1 n-1

and 0  y  2n - 2. Since

n+t-1 n-1

 4n - 4, we have x  0.

(d1) Assume b  x + y. We specialize Za,b to Za,b-x-y  W  W , where W is a general

union of x schemes of type (2n - 1, 2) with respect to H and W  is a general union of y schemes

of type (2, 2n - 1) with respect to H. By [2] and Lemma 2.2 we have hi(H, IW H (t)) = 0. Thus

it is sufficient to prove that Za,b-x-y  ResH (W  W ) gives the expected number of conditions

to H0(OPn(t - 1)). By Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that Za,b-x-y  ResH (W ) gives the

expected number of conditions to H0(OPn (t - 1)) and that

h0(IZa,b-x-y (t - 2))  max{0,

n+t-1 n

- y(2n - 1) - (n + 1)a - (2n + 1)(b - x - y)}.

The latter condition is satisfied by the inductive assumption if t  5, while if t = 4 we use that

a > n and hence h0(IZa,b-x-y (t - 2)) = 0.

Claim 1: Za,b-x-y  ResH (W ) gives the expected number of conditions to H0(OPn (t - 1)).

Proof of Claim 1: Set B := ResH (W ). Since y  2n - 2, we have 2x  4n - 4. Since (n +

1)a+(2n+1)b 

n+t n

+2n-2 and deg(Za,b-x-y ResH (W )) = (n+1)a+(2n+1)b-

n+t-1 n-1

- 2x,

we need to prove that h1(IZa,b-x-yB(t - 1)) = 0. Write

n+t-2 n-1

+ (2n - 1)y + (2n - 1)w + z with

w, z integers and 0  z  2n - 2. Since y  2n - 2, we have w  0.

(d1.1) Assume b - x - y  w. We specialize Za,b-x-y to Za,b-x-y-w  W  with W  general

union of w schemes of type (2n - 1, 2) with respect to H.

Since deg(W   H) 

n+t-2 n-1

,

the

inductive assumption gives h1(H, I (t - H(Za,b-x-y-w W ) 1)) = 0 and hence it is sufficient to prove

h (I 1
Za,b-x-y-w

(t

-

2))

=

0.

This

is

not

numerically

impossible,

because

n+t-2 n-1

- deg(W   H) =

u  2n - 2 and 2x  2n - 2 + deg(Za,b) -

n+t n

+ 2n - 2.

If t  5 we may use the inductive

assumption. If t = 4 we have h0(IZa,0 (2)) = 0 and to get h0(IZa,b (4)) = 0 we insert two other

schemes of type (n, 1) to handle B.

(d1.2) Now assume b < x + y + w. Write

n+t-2 t-1

= (2n - 1)(b - x) + nu1 + u2 with u1, u2

integers and 0  u2  n - 1.

Assume for the moment a  u1. We specialize Za,b-x-y  B to a general E := Za-u1,0  B  M0  M  with M0 a general union of u1 schemes of type (n, 1) with respect to H and M  a general

union of u2 schemes of type (1, n) with respect to H. We want to prove that h1(H, IHE (t)) = 0

and h1(IResH(E)(t - 1)) = 0 (these vanishings would prove Claim 1 in this case). To apply the

inductive assumption to E  H we need that either (2n + 1)(b - x) 

n+2 3

or (n + 1)u1 

n+2 3

.

Assume that both inequalities fails and so (n+1)u1 +(2n-1)(b-x)  2

n+3 3

- 2.

Since u2  n-1,

we have (2n - 1)(b - x) + nu1 

n+t-1 n-1

- n + 1. The right hand side of the last inequality is

an

increasing

function

so,

taking

t

=

we

get

2

n+3 3

n+4 n-1

- n + 1, which is

false for n  5. The scheme ResH (E) is a general union of Za-u1,0, u1 points of H and b - x

tangent vectors of H. We use the Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem, Lemma 2.4 and the obvious

inequality u1 + 2(b - x) 

n+t-1 n

n+t-2 n

except

that

if

we

- (n + 1)(a- u1)- 2(b - x)}.

If a - u1  n + 1, then h0(IZa-u1,0 (2)) = 0. If a - u1  n,

then h0(IZa-u1,0 (2)) =

n+2-a+u1 2

.

Now assume u1 > a. We specialize B  Za,x-y-z to E := B  M   M  with M  b - x - y

(n, 1). We conclude as above (to handle H  E we use that E  H  E  H and we proved that

h1(H, IEH (t)) = 0), concluding the proof of Claim 1.

(d2) Assume x  b < x+y. Write 2(y -b+x) = nw1 +w2 with w1  {0, 1} and 0  w2  n-1.

We specialize Za,b to J := Za-x-y+b,0 M1 M2 M3 M4 with M1 a general union of x schemes of

type (2n-1, 2), M2 a general union of x+y -b schemes of type (2, 2n-1), M3 a general union of w1

schemes of type (n, 1) and M4 a general union of w2 schemes of type (1, n). Note that deg(J H) =

n+t-1 n-1

.

By Lemma 2.4 to prove that Za,b gives independent conditions to H0(OPn (t)) it is

sufficient to prove that h1(H, IH(M1M3)(t)) = 0 (true by the inductive assumption, because

e1  1 and so |a - x - y + b| 

n+2 3

since t  5) and that h1(IZa-x-y+b,0 (t - 1)) = 0. The last

vanishing is not numerically impossible, because deg(Za-x-y+b,0) = deg(Za,b) -

n+t-1 n-1

- e2 - 2x

with x  n and deg(Za,b) 

n+t n

+ 2n - 2. Thus h1(IZa-x-y+b,0 (t - 1)) = 0 by the Alexander-

Hirschowitz theorem.

Assume b < x.

Set

u := (

n+t-1 n-1

- (2n - 1)b)/2 and v :=

n+t-1 n-1

- (2n - 1)b - 2u.

We specialize Za,b to Za-u-v,0  M5  M6 with M5 general union of u schemes of type (n, 1)

with respect to H and M6 general union of v schemes of type (1, n) with respect to H. We have

hi(H, IHM5M6(t)) = 0, i = 0, 1. For the details of the conclusion, see the proof of Claim 1 in

step (d1).

6. Proof of Theorem 1.6
Proof of Theorem 1.6: Let x be a positive integer such that Lx is very ample. Applying the theorem (assumed to be true) to the line bundle L := Lx and finitely many times to the same zero-dimensional scheme W and to finitely many line bundles M  Li, 0  i  x - 1, we reduce
to the case in which L is very ample. This reduction step is exactly the reduction step in [6, §7] and we believe that this should be better known. Set n := dim X. As in [6] we use induction on n.
We use the same strategy: we try to land after a controlled number of steps in a simpler situation,
which may be considered as a winning situation, e.g. because there are no tangential schemes. (a) Assume n = 1. In this case Za,b is a general union of connected schemes of multiplicity 2
and 3 whose support is general in Xreg. In characteristic 0 it is sufficient to quote [14]. (b) Assume n > 1 and that Theorem 1.6 is true for all projective varieties of dimension
< n. Since L is very ample, there is D  |L| such that D  W = . Set M1 := M|D and R := L|D. Fix an integer k1 > 0 such that h1(IW  M  Lt) = 0 for all t  k1 - 1 and (inductive assumption) for all (c, d)  N2 and all integers t  k1 either h1(D, IAc,d  M1  Rt) = 0 or h0(D, IAc,d  M1  Rt) = 0, where Ac,d  D is a general union of c 2-points of D and d tangential schemes of D. Set  := h0(IW  M  Lk1). For all integers t  k1 set A(t) := h0(D, M1  Lt) and B(t) := h0(IW  M  Lt). We have B(t) - B(t - 1) = A(t) for all t  k1, because h1(IW  M  Lt) = 0 for all t  k1 - 1. Since the function A(t) is strictly increasing, there is an integer k2 > k1 such that A(k2)  (2n + 1) + 2n. By [6] (case with multiplicity 2) taking a high tensor power of L instead of L we may also assume that the thesis holds with k2 = 1 for all (a, b) with b = 0. Since (Rt) = A(t) for all t  k1, Riemann-Roch gives that A(t) increases like ctn-1/(n - 1)! and B(t) increases like ctn/n!, where c = L · · · L is the self-intersection number of n copies of L. Thus we may find integers k0 > k3  k > 0 such that for all t  k3 we have
(1) A(t)  (2n - 1)A(t - 2); (2) A(t)  n(2n + 1) + 4n; (3) B(k0)  5nB(k3).
Fix an integer t  k0 and (a, b)  N2. If L is any line bundle on X and Z, Z are zero-dimensional subchemes of X such that Z  Z and h1(IZ  L) = 0 (resp. h0(IZ  L) = 0), then h1(IZ  L) = 0 (resp. h0(IZ  L) = 0). Thus increasing or decreasing both elements of (a, b) we see that it is sufficient to prove the statement for all (a, b) such that B(t) - n  (n + 1)a + (2n + 1)b  B(t) + n (Remark 2.7). We only use the last inequality, but a weaker inequality like (n + 1)a + (2n + 1)b  B(t) + 1010n would work.
(b1) We define integers bx  0 and ex  0 for all x  1 until we will arrive at some integer y > 0 such that b < b1 + e1 + · · · + by + ey or at step t - k3, i.e. the steps in which we would define bt-k3 and et-k3. At that point we go to step (b2). Since 2n - 1 is odd, there are integers b1 and e1 such that A(t) = (2n - 1)b1 + 2e1 and 0  e1  2n - 2. Since A(t)  n(2n - 1) + 2(2n - 2), we

TANGENTIAL VARIETY

have b1  n. We specialize Za,b to the union W1 of Za,b-b1-e1 , the union E1 of b1 schemes of type

(2n - 1, 2) with respect to D and the union F1 of e1 schemes of type (2, 2n - 1) with respect to D.

Since W  D = , deg(W1  D) = A(t) and W1  D is a general union of b1 tangential schemes of D

and e1 tangent vectors of D, Lemma 2.2 gives hi(D, IW1D  M1  Rt) = 0. Thus it is sufficient to prove that either h0(IW ResD(W1)  M  L(t-1)) = 0 or h1(IW ResD(W1)  M  L(t-1)) = 0.

Set W2 := Za,b-b1-e1  ResD(F1). Since ResD(E1) is a general union of b1 tangent vectors of D, by

Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that h1(IW W2  L(t-1)) = 0 and that h0(IW W2  L(t-1)) 

max{0, B(t - 1) - deg(ResD(W1))}. We call §(t - 2) the latter condition and we will check it in step

(b2). Now we continue the proof that h1(IW W2  L(t-1)) = 0. Let b2 and e2 be the only integers

such that A(t - 1) = (2n - 1)e1 + (2n - 1)b2 + 2e2 with 0  e2  2n - 2. Since t - 1  k3 and

e1  2n - 2, we have b2  0. We specialize W2 to a general union of Za,b-b1-b2-e1-e2 , a general

union of b2 schemes of type (2n - 1, 2) with respect to D and e2 schemes of type (2, 2n - 1) with

respect to D. Note that deg(D (E2 F2)) = A(t-1). Note that ResD(ResD(F1)) = . By Lemma

By

Lemma 2.4 it is sufficient to prove that h1(IW Za,b-b1-b2-a1-a2 ResD(F2)M L(t-2)) = 0 and that

we call §(t-3) the last condition and we will check it in step (b2). Here we continue the proof of the

h1-vanishing. Let b3 and e3 be the only integer such that (2n - 1)e2 + (2n - 1)b3 + 2e3 = A(t - 2). Since t - 2  k0, we have b3  0. We specialize W3 to a general union of of Za,b-b1-b2-b3-e1-e2-e3 , the union E3 of b3 schemes of type (2n - 1, 2) with respect to D and the union F3 of e3 schemes of type (2, 2n - 1) with respect to D. Then we continue. We need to check that this construction

stops before using Lk3-1.

Claim 1: There is an integer y  t - k3 - 1 such that b < b1 + e1 + · · · + by + ey.

Proof of Claim 1: We have (n+1)a+(2n+1)b  B(t)+2n-2. Since (2n-1)(bi+ei)  A(t-i),

for all i  t - k1 we have b1 + e1 + · · · + by + ey  (

y))/(2n - 1). Since (n + 1)a + (2n + 1)b  B(t) + n, t  k0 and B(k0)  5nB(k3), we get Claim 1.

(b1.1) By Claim 1 there is a maximal integer z such that b  b1 + e1 + · · · + bz + ez and

(modulo the check of §(x) for t - z - 2  x  t - 2) to conclude for Za,b it would be sufficient

to prove that h (I 1 W Za,b-b1-e1-···-bz-ez B  M  L(t-z)) = 0, where B is a general union of ez tangential schemes of D. Set w := b - b1 - e1 - · · · - bz - ez.

(b1.1.1.1) First assume (2n + 1)w  A(t - 1 - z) - deg(B). Write A(t - 1 - z) = (2n + 1)w +

deg(B) + na1 + c1 with (a1, c1)  N2 and 0  c1  n - 1. Assume for the moment a  a1 + c1. We specialize Za,w  B to E := B  Za-a1-a2,0  G  G, where G is a general union of a1 schemes of type (n, 1) with respect to D and G is a general union of of c1 schemes of type (1, n) with respect to D. By the inductive assumption we have hi(D, IED  M1  Rt-z) = 0, i = 0, 1, and so (modulo the checks of §x for t - z - 1  x  t) we conclude if h1(IResD(E)(t - z - 1)) = 0. This is
true, because we only have 2-points, we use [6] and from L(t-1) down we always had schemes Ei for Li with deg(Ei)  B(i).
Now assume a < a1+c1. We specialize Za,w B to E := B G1 G2, where G1 is a general union
of min{a1, a} schemes of type (n, 1), G2 =  if a  a1 and G2 is a general union of a - a1 schemes of type (1, n). We get h1(D, IED  M1  Rt-z) = 0 and obviously h1(IW E  M  Lt-z-1) = 0.
(b1.1.1.2) Now assume (2n + 1)w  A(t - 1 - z) - deg(B). Assume for the moment a  2ez+1. We specialize Za,w  B to E := Za-2ez,w-xz+1  G3  G4 with G3 a general union of bz+1 schemes
of type (2n - 1, 2) with respect to D and G4 a general union of 2ez+1 schemes of type (1, n) with respect to D. By the inductive assumption on D we have hi(D, IE  M1  R(t-z)) = 0, i = 1, 2, while for ResD(E) we always have at most 2n - 3 tangential schemes. We degenerate ResD(E)

and after taking ResD of the degenerated subscheme we go to a case Za,0.
If a < 2ez we specialize Za,w  B to F := Za-2ez,w-xz+1  G3  G4 with G3 a general union of
bz+1 schemes of type (2n - 1, 2) with respect to D and G4 a general union of 2ez+1 schemes of type (1, n) with respect to D. We only have h1(D, IDF  M1  R(t-z-1)) = 0 (the h0 is often = 0, say h0 = ), but the next steps are even easier because at the next step we may lose 2n - 2 at

each step and hence we continue without using differential Horace (no scheme of type (2, 2n - 1)

or (1, n)) until we arrive at a scheme Z0,0 =  before using L(k3-1).

(b2) We need to check the uses of Lemma 2.4 and that the construction stops in a winning

position before we use Lk3-1. We stress again that all steps not using Lemma 2.4 either are in a

case in which the degree of the scheme, G, involved for Lx is such that deg(GD) = A(x) (and we have hi(D, IF D M1Rx) = 0, i = 0, 1) and deg(G)-B(x) = deg(ResD(G))-B(x-1) or we had a configuration, A, with not enough 2-points or tangential schemes to get such an equality and we specialize to a configuration A with only h1(D, IA  M1  Rx) = 0, but ResD(A) is so small that obviously h1(IW ResD(A)M L(x-1)) = 0. Consider any use of Lemma 2.4 that requires to check the inequality h0(IW Fx  M  Lx)  max{0, B(x + 1) - deg(W  Fx) - deg(Gx)} with Gx  D, and Gx a general union of points and tangent vectors of D. At the beginning we observed that after the very first step we are in the range in which the degrees of the zero-dimensional schemes, , are at most the h0 of the line bundle L we are using and so we need to prove h1(I  L)) = 0, except for the use of Lemma 2.4 for which we need a weaker statement: the condition h0  max{0, } is equivalent to h1  max{0, } for a suitable integer . First consider the first z + 1 steps. Here at least b1 + · · · + bz + e1 + · · · + bz  (B(t) - B(t - z - 1))/(2n - 1) tangential schemes are fully used, i.e. we either used their intersection with D and then also their residual with respect to D, or first we used the tangential scheme of D (its degree is 2n - 1) and then the residual (a tangent vector of D) is omitted quoting Lemma 2.4. In the first z steps (the ones involving (bi, ei)) we omit (quoting Lemma 2.4) b1 + · · · + bz tangent vectors. Suppose that when using L(x+1) we have a zero-dimensional scheme Fx+1  Gx+1  Ax+1 with Fx+1  D = , deg(Gx+1) very small, say deg(Gx+1)  (2n-2)(2n+1) and Ax+1  D with Ax+1 general union of points and tangent vectors of D. Lemma 2.4 say that to prove h (I 1 W Fx+1Gx+1Ax+1  M  L(x+1)) = 0 it is sufficient to prove that h1(IW Fx+1Gx+1  M  L(x+1)) = 0 and h0(IW Fx+1ResD(Gx+1)  M  Lx)  max{0, B(x + 1) - deg(W  Fx+1  Gx+1  Ax+1)}. Since deg(Gx+1  Ax+1)  A(t + 1) = B(t + 1) - B(t), the proof of the upper bound for h0 (i.e. the upper bound for h1) is translated in a similar question, but for Lx instead of L(x+1). We use the same method for Lx for Fx+1  ResD(Gx+1). If the proof that h1(IW Fx+1Gx+1  M  L(x+1)) = 0 stops after at most  steps to W   or to W  Za,0 (i.e. for L(x+1-)), the proof for the upper bound of h1 stops after at most  steps, i.e. we use L(t+1-) but not L(x-). Call U (i) the scheme such that we need to prove h1(IW U(i)  M  Li) = 0 and set  (i) := B(i) - deg(W ) - deg(U (i)). We started with U (t) := Za,b and we have  (t)  0. Going down in the first z + 1 steps we delete (by Lemma 2.4) at least b1 + · · · + bz tangent vectors and hence after at most z + 1 steps, we get  (z + 1)  2(b1 + · · · + bz). When for Li we use d schemes of type (n, 1) with respect to D, then they give a contribution of d to the integer  (i + 2) -  (i). To conclude for Li it is sufficient to have U (i) =  and so it is sufficient to have  (i)  B(i) - deg(W ). Since (2n + 1)/2  n + 1, if for some Li, i  t - z - 2, we have not yet won, we have  (i)  B(t)/2n and so  (i)  B(i). We arrive at such an integer i before k3 - 1, because t  k0 and B(k0)  5nB(k3).
