## Abstract

The exact eigenenergies of the $T_{4c}=[cc][\bar{c}\bar{c}]$, $T_{4b}=[bb][\bar{b}\bar{b}]$, and $T_{2[bc]}=[bc][\bar{b}\bar{c}]$ tetraquarks are calculated within the extended transitional Hamiltonian approach, in which the so-called Bethe \emph{ansatz} within an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra is used. We fit the parameters appearing in the transitional region from phenomenology associated with potential candidates of tetraquarks. The rotation and vibration transitional theory seems to provide a better description of heavy tetraquarks than other attempts within the same formalism. Our results indicate that the pairing strengths are large enough to provide binding; an extended comparison with the current literature is also performed.
