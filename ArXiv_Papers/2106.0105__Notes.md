## Abstract

We discuss renormalization group flows in two-dimensional quantum field theories with (0,2) supersymmetry. We focus on theories with UV described by a Landau-Ginzburg Lagrangian and use the chiral algebra to constrain the IR dynamics. We present examples where the structure of the chiral algebra is incompatible with unitarity of the IR superconformal theory and discuss the implications of this result for programs of classifying (0,2) SCFTs as endpoints of flows from simple Lagrangian theories.
