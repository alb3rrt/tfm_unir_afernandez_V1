ABSTRACT The proper motions of stars in the outskirts of globular clusters are used to estimate their velocity dispersion profiles to as far as possible within their tidal radii. We use the color-magnitude diagram to select high probability cluster stars for 25 globular clusters within 20 kpc of the sun, 19 of which have substantial numbers of stars at large radii. Of the 19, 11 clusters have a falling velocity dispersion in the 3-6 half mass radii range, 6 are flat or falling, and 2 plausibly have a rising velocity dispersion. The profiles are all in the range expected from simulated clusters started at high redshift in a zoom-in cosmological simulation. A cluster that is at a sub-halo center can lead to a rising velocity dispersion profile. Additional cluster membership criteria and improved kinematic data will further test these preliminary results.

1. INTRODUCTION
Whether or not globular clusters are surrounded by locally bound dark matter sub-halos as they orbit within the galaxy is an important observational question that will test theories of globular cluster origins and to some degree the nature of dark matter (Peebles 1984). Star clusters forming in a self-gravitating galactic gas disk rotating within a dark matter halo are not expected to have an excess of dark matter above the galactic background dark matter. Hence, local dark matter is not expected in the disk population of globular clusters (Searle & Zinn 1978), which is relatively metal rich, and younger than the halo clusters (VandenBerg et al. 2013). The disk globular clusters likely formed as the high mass end of gas disk star cluster formation (Portegies Zwart et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2018). The halo clusters are very old (VandenBerg et al. 2013), likely forming in pre-galactic sub-halos which later merged into the Milky Way's halo (Searle & Zinn 1978). One possibility is that halo clusters formed at or near the center of small dark matter halos and depending on orbital history retain a significant excess of dark matter to the present day (Boldrini et al. 2020).

servational capabilities (Baumgardt et al. 2019; Sollima 2020; Wan et al. 2021). The observational issues are velocity accuracy, cluster membership criteria, and being able to reach sufficiently large numbers of stars at faint magnitudes. The observational results are not yet conclusive, with no compelling evidence for any dark matter above the galactic background (Baumgardt et al. 2019; Wan et al. 2021). A second issue is the development of dynamical models that extend to large cluster radii and which account for the extended envelopes that arise as a result of internal heating of stars and galactic tides (Spitzer 1987; Fukushige & Heggie 2000; Daniel et al. 2017; Pen~arrubia et al. 2017), which can appear as thin stellar streams (Odenkirchen et al. 2003; Grillmair & Dionatos 2006) and/or extended envelopes (Odenkirchen et al. 2003; Kuzma et al. 2018).
This paper analyzes the available Gaia (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016) EDR3 data (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021) for metal poor halo globular clusters sufficiently close to have good internal velocities from proper motions. The main innovations are color-magnitude weighting of the data and comparison to n-body simulation results that form globular clusters at various locations of high redshift sub-halos, including the sub-halo centers. This paper is a preliminary investigation using currently available data, straightforward measurement methods and a simple comparison of models to the data.

The metal poor halo globular clusters are promising targets to search for evidence of dark matter local to clusters. We select Milky Way clusters that are metal poor ([Fe/H] below -1) and within 20 kpc of the sun. The more distant clusters will have somewhat larger proper motion uncertainties, but we include them to determine where the falloff in internal kinematic measurement precision occurs for the currently available data. A galactic latitude of at least 20 degrees minimizes extinction and extinction variation with position. Color-magnitude filtering requires accurate colors and brightness, which can be significantly compromised by high and variable extinction. Higher latitudes also greatly reduce the surface density of contaminating field stars.
The cluster sample is listed in Table 1 along with some of their properties as listed in Baumgardt et al. (2019) and available at https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/HolgerBaumgardt/globular/. The last column is our qualitative assessment of the shape of the outer velocity dispersion-radius relation in the radial range of 3-6 half-mass radii in Figures 2-11 below. The clusters in the table are in the same order as the subsequent plots.
3. VELOCITY DISPERSION MEASUREMENT
The Gaia proper motions are converted to velocities using the cluster distances of Baumgardt et al. (2019). For simplicity, the two components of the velocity are added together to produce a total velocity in the plane of the cluster. While there is useful information in the velocity anisotropy at large distances, its measurement beyond 3 half-mass radii is very uncertain with the current data. Most of our clusters have been previously

shown to have nearly isotropic planar velocities and relatively little rotation (Vasiliev & Baumgardt 2021). The mean radial and tangential velocities measured here were found to be 1-2 km s-1, generally consistent with zero and small enough to not be dynamically significant. All velocities, including those for unrelated field stars, are measured with respect to the cluster center and the published velocity of the cluster. Our analysis assumes that all the stars, including foreground and background stars, are at the same distance.
Stars are selected using a matched filter technique, which depends on how close a star is to a colormagnitude locus at the distance and metallicity of the cluster (Rockosi et al. 2002; Grillmair 2009). Specifically, we created a color-magnitude locus for each cluster using the observed Gaia G, GBP - GRP measurements, dereddened using the reddening maps of

Schlegel et al. (1998), themselves corrected using the prescription of Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011). We employed theoretical isochrones with appropriate metallicities from http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/cmd (Girardi et al. 2004), though we adjusted these isochrones to better match the observed red giant branches, where the photometric uncertainties are particularly small. The color offset from the color-magnitude relation normalized to the quoted photometric uncertainties of every star less than 2 from the locus is included as a measurement. The effectiveness of the technique is shown in Figure 1.
The color offset is used to construct a Gaussian weight exp [-(c/c)2/2], where c is set at 1.5 which gives a weight at the color edge of 0.41. The same analysis with c = 1 gives essentially identical results. For weighted velocity dispersion measurements, the color weight and the proper motion weight are multiplied to give a total weight for each star. Every star in the sample has an estimated error in each of the two components of proper motion, which we combine in quadrature for a total proper motion error. The resulting velocity variance is used with weighted measures of the velocity dispersion.
4. VELOCITY DISPERSION PROFILE ANALYSIS
Estimating the velocity dispersion is relatively straightforward for a set of identical stars with no contamination in velocity space. The cluster stars bright enough to have high precision proper motions are generally beyond the main sequence turn-off so have comparable masses even though their luminosities vary greatly. The narrow range in mass means that the stars we examine should have essentially the same velocity and radial distribution. We use three separate velocity dispersion estimation approaches to provide some sense of the potential systematic errors. In all cases a maximum velocity for inclusion in the cluster is set to screen out high velocity interlopers. The maximum velocity for inclusion in the cluster has no radial dependence and is chosen in the range of 25 to 50 km s-1 based on the velocity dispersion of the cluster.
The two simplest approaches to measuring the velocity dispersion are simply to calculate the variance of the velocities, with and without weighting of the stars. The error in the velocity dispersion  is estimated as / 2N . The figures also display the radial and tangential component of the velocity dispersion (orange and purple solid lines) although most of the analysis focuses on the total value. We assume that there is no mean tangential or radial proper motion velocity, which is generally a safe assumption (Vasiliev & Baumgardt 2021).

The third method of velocity dispersion calculation is to assume that the velocity distribution in each radial bin is the sum of two Gaussians, one for the cluster stars and a much wider one for the distribution of field stars. The field star velocity distribution is measured at large radius, in the range of 300-500 pc from the cluster center, by minimizing a 2. This distribution is assumed to be constant at smaller radii, with the number of stars proportional to the area in each radial bin, which declines as the square of the radius. The velocity dispersion in the cluster is the sum of the background Gaussian velocity distribution and a cluster velocity distribution with a width determined by minimizing 2 over a range of 30-50 km s-1, depending on cluster. The values of 2 per degree of freedom are not statistically well defined and further improvements in velocity estimation are required. Overall this method, as implemented here, tends to have large point to point variations and very large velocities where there is little data.
The velocity dispersion measurements are displayed in Figures 2 to 11. The plots show the data with the unweighted velocity dispersion in the left panel and all three measures of the velocity dispersion profile along with model curves in the right panel. The last column of Table 1 gives our assessment of whether the velocity dispersion is rising, falling, flat, or no stars at a projected distance in the range around 6 times the halfmass radius. Of the 25 clusters there are two with rising velocity dispersion profiles, six with no stars at large radius, eleven with falling dispersion profiles, and six that are flat or falling.
For comparison we plot projected velocity dispersion profiles for W=5 and 10 King models, with velocities calculated from points generated with the McCluster model-maker (Ku¨pper et al. 2011). The King model is not expected to be a good representation of the outer density profile of a cluster that is undergoing slow mass loss. We also plot three models from a simulation of globular clusters in a cosmological model (Carlberg & Keating 2021). The green line shows the relation for a cluster with no dark matter other than the galactic background. The other two are clusters that are the centers of small dark matter halos, with dark matter masses equaling the enclosed stellar mass at 8 (blue) and 12 (cyan) half mass radii. The dark matter mass density is nearly constant with radius over this range so there is essentially no detectable dark matter within the stellar cluster, but it begins to dominate at about 10 half mass radii. Beyond the tidal radius the dark matter is subject to tidal removal. The cluster simulations were projected on the sky and measured in the same as the observational data. The simulations find essentially

Note that the radial range is larger in the left panel. The 2D velocity dispersion profile has three estimates, all shown as black lines. The weighted and un-weighted sum of squares and the double Gaussian fits (black solid, dotted and dot-dashed lines, respectively), The radial and tangential velocity dispersion are the orange and purple solid lines, respectively, with the dotted lines being the mean velocities. The plotted model profiles are: King W=5 and 10 (red), simulated cluster in galactic dark matter background (green), and two simulated clusters at their sub-halo centers (blue and cyan). The upward arrows on the horizontal axis indicate the 3D half-mass radius, and 3 and 6 times its value. The vertical dashed line is the tidal radius. The rightward facing arrows on the vertical axis indicate the velocity of the average proper motion error (red), the weighted average error (green) and the maximum allowed proper motion error (blue). The sizes of the circles in the left panel are proportional to the proper-motion weight and the colors indicate how close the star is to the color-magnitude diagram locus, with weight declining from black to red to green to blue to cyan.

a continuous range of possibilities for the large radius velocity dispersion profile. The blue line shows a cluster with approximately the median remnant sub-halo and the cyan line is for a cluster with the most massive remaining dark matter sub-halo. The model profiles are normalized to the velocity dispersion at the half-mass radius or nearby. There is no fitting of the models to the data at this stage.
The velocity dispersion profiles of NGC 6752 and NGC 6205 exhibit a rise in the velocity dispersion in the range

30-50 pc. In both cases the velocity anisotropy becomes radial at the onset of the rise. The radii here generally extend to somewhat larger distances than those in (Baumgardt et al. 2019) with similar values for the radii in common. Background velocities become a large uncertainty beyond 100 pc and often into 50 pc. However, there is no clear indication in the current data that the rise in velocity dispersion in the 30-50 pc range is the result of background stars. On the other hand, these results are preliminary until stars are confirmed to be

5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Determining which stars are globular cluster members is the central issue of measuring their velocity dispersion at large radii. The approach here is to use a colormagnitude relation tuned to the high precision Gaia photometry, which has the advantage that the membership criteria are completely independent of the cluster kinematics.
Of the 25 clusters in our sample, 19 have sufficient numbers and accuracy of proper motion velocities at large radii to give a velocity dispersion profile. Of the 19, 11 have velocity dispersion profiles that are falling between 3 and 6 half mass radii, with a further 6 with larger errors that are flat or falling. Therefore, one result of our analysis is that 11/19, 58%, of the sample clusters show no evidence for significant local dark matter based on their falling velocity dispersion profiles at large radius.
The interpretation of the velocity dispersion profile of the 8 of 19 clusters, 42%, where it does not smoothly fall toward zero depends on dynamical assumptions. An isolated star cluster in dynamical equilibrium will have a falling velocity dispersion profile, however tidal fields complicate the picture. For instance, even the simplest case of steady tidal field for a cluster on a circular orbit, the paths of individual stars near the tidal radius are quite complex (Fukushige & Heggie 2000). N-body simulations find that clusters without local dark matter orbiting in a dark matter background can have a flat velocity dispersion profile (Carlberg & Keating 2021). Moreover, in the presence of a local dark matter halo the velocities of stars at large radii can, in principle, range from falling to rising velocity dispersion, depending on how binary encounters and tidal encounters add energy to stars to boost them from the inner region of the cluster to large radii.
We find that two clusters, NGC 6205 and 6794, plausibly have a rising velocity dispersion at large radius. The rise is similar to what is seen in n-body simulations of star clusters with local dark matter halos and is tentative evidence of a local dark matter halos for these two clusters. The rise in velocities is subject to the measurement problem of interloper background stars. Cluster membership criteria will be strengthened with additional photometric and/or spectroscopic data to confirm that all the stars share the chemical abundance signatures of the cluster stars. Future Gaia data releases will also greatly reduce the kinematic errors. This increased accuracy will also enable more distant clusters to be ex-

amined for signs of dark halos. The second complication is that the galactic tidal field can lead to a galactic orbit phase dependent boost of velocities in the outskirts of the cluster. Consequently, it is not yet possible to say whether the rising velocity dispersion profiles are definitive evidence of local dark matter sub-halos.
The two clusters that show the most convincing rise in velocity dispersion, NGC 6205 and 6752, are at Galactocentric distances, RGC , of 8.3 and 5.2 kpc, respectively, with estimated peri-Galacticons of 1.55 and 3.23 kpc, and apo-Galacticons of 8.32 and 5.17 kpc, respectively Baumgardt et al. (2019). Estimating the tidal radius of a cluster of mass Mc as rt = RGC [GMc/(2Vc2)]1/3 (Webb et al. 2013) where Vc = 220 km s-1 is the assumed flat circular velocity (Bovy et al. 2012), gives tidal radii of 113 and 65 pc for NGC 6205 and 6752, respectively. These tidal radii are well beyond the radii at which the velocity dispersion profiles begin their rise. If outward tidal flows of stars are artificially boosting the velocity dispersion at large radius then generally there will also be a rise in the radial velocities, which are small in the two clusters with rising velocity dispersions.
A local dark matter sub-halo would deepen the gravitational potential of a cluster and could have some bearing on the multiple stellar populations of globular clusters (Gratton et al. 2012). Detailed abundance studies do show some differences from field stars in NGC 6752 (Norris et al. 1981) but no clear differences for NGC 6205 (Carretta & Bragaglia 2021). NGC 6752 stands out in a comparison of widths of the asymptotic giant branch and the red giant branch, but NGC 6205 does not (Lagioia et al. 2021). We conclude that there is no clear trend of cluster metallicity trends with velocity dispersion profile, within our small sample of clusters.
Our measurement of the velocity dispersion profiles did not include an allowance for rotation, a mean radial velocity, or anisotropy of the velocity ellipsoid. However, all of the clusters in our sample have been previously studied (Baumgardt et al. 2019; Vasiliev & Baumgardt 2021) and in all cases these effects were found to be small relative to the velocity dispersion. Similarly, in our measurements the mean tangential and radial velocities were found to have values of 1-2 km s-1at low statistical significance. The two rising velocity dispersion profile clusters, NGC 6205 and 6752, show little rotation or velocity anisotropy. NGC 6752 does have stars moving outward in the region near the tidal radius, but the velocities are much smaller than the velocity dispersion. In the case of NGC 6205 the outer stars are moving inward at small velocities. More accurate measurements of these quantities at large radii will be carried out as the data improve.
