We decompose the electric current into the dissipative and non-dissipative parts and take the dissipative part for the imaging of the black hole. We investigate the effect of the charged scalar condensate on the image. We obtain the bulk images that indicate the discontinuous change of the size of the photon ring.

1 Introduction
The AdS/CFT correspondence [1­3] is a duality between strongly coupled quantum field theories (QFTs) and classical gravity in AdS spacetime. In recent years, it has been conjectured that the duality can describe realistic systems such as condensed matter physics [4­ 8]. In particular, we can analyze the thermal states of QFTs by the black hole physics in AdS/CFT. How can we directly test the existence of the dual black hole for a given QFT? We will address this problem in this paper.
In astronomy, the Event Horizon Telescope [9] succeeded in constructing the first image of the supermassive black hole in M87. They observed the photon sphere of the black hole,
­1­

and it is one of the most direct observations of the black hole in our real space. On the other hand, there is a proposal that a similar observation of the black hole through AdS/CFT [10, 11]. They considered QFT on Rt × S2 and applied a localized time-periodic external source in S2. In the dual gravitational picture, the external source is mapped to the boundary condition of the bulk field. Because of the time-dependant boundary condition, a wave is sent from the AdS boundary and propagates through the black hole spacetime. The wave is diffracted by the black hole and, eventually, arrives at other points on the AdS boundary. From the asymptotic data of the bulk field, which corresponds to the response function on the QFT side, they constructed the image of the AdS black hole. The formula for converting the response function to the image of the black hole has also been obtained in Refs.[10, 11]. In this paper, we apply this idea to the model of the holographic superconductor.
In this paper, we consider imaging of the black hole dual to a superconductor. A model of the holographic superconductor on S2 is composed of a Maxwell field and charged scalar field in a fixed spherical AdS black hole background [12­14]. (We only focus on the probe limit of the holographic superconductor.) When the Hawking temperature is smaller than a critical temperature T < Tc, the AdS black hole becomes unstable against charged scalar field perturbation. Resultantly, the U (1)-gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken, and the black hole with the charged scalar field hair is to realize as a stable configuration [15­18]. We can identify this phase transition as the superconducting phase transition. We consider a laser applied to one point of the superconductor on S2. From the dual gravitational point of view, the external electromagnetic field is regarded as the boundary condition of the bulk Maxwell field. We construct the image of the black hole through the response function of the electromagnetic field, i.e., the electric current. The electric current can be decomposed into the dissipative and non-dissipative parts (i.e., modes with phase difference  = 0, /2 with respect to the applied external field.). We will see that the information of the photon ring is mainly encoded in the dissipative part. We will also investigate how the superconducting phase transition affects the image of the AdS black hole.
This paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we review the previous work [10, 11] in which the image formation of the AdS black hole. In section 3, we introduce the holographic model for the superconductor on S2. We explicitly construct the gravitational solution in the superconducting phase. In section 4, we consider the linear perturbation on the holographic superconductor. It is decomposed into vector and scalar modes. In section 5, we show images of black holes dual to the superconductor. We estimate the radius of the photon ring in the image and found that it changes discontinuously for the vector mode. The final section is devoted to the conclusion.
2 Bulk imaging through AdS/CFT
We will review the imaging black hole through AdS/CFT correspondence [10, 11]. For simplicity, let us consider a minimal coupled scalar field  in Schwarzchild-AdS4 spacetime

(2.5)

According to the AdS/CFT dictionary, SO and O are two independent functions, and we can regard them as the external scalar source and its response function in the dual CFT,

respectively. Note that when we deal with other fields like a vector field, we should be

careful which coefficient corresponds to the dual CFT value we want. We will mention the

holographic superconductor case in Section 4 and Appendix B.

Let SO be the following axisymmetric and monochromatically oscillating Gaussian

SO(t, , ) = e-itg() ,

(2.8)

Eq. (2.6) gives the normalization condition of  at the AdS boundary. We also impose the in-going boundary condition at the horizon of the Sch-AdS4. Then, we have the unique solution of (2.5) and, in particular, the response function O(t, , ) as the coefficient of r-3 term. Schematically, the source SO at the AdS boundary excites the scalar field, propagates in the bulk, and reaches another point at the AdS boundary as depicted in Fig. 1. We can get the picture of a bulk object like a black hole by imaging the response function through the lens.
To construct the image of the scalar field discussed above, we introduce an optical system with a convex lens and a spherical screen on the small patch on the AdS boundary. Consider setting a convex lens localized at z = 0 with the focus length z = ±f as depicted

­3­

in Fig. 2. The incident plane wave comes from z < 0 and the lens emits spherical waves to z > 0. Let M(x) and M~ (x) be the wave function of a monochromatic incident wave
and diffracted wave with frequency , respectively. According to the wave optics [19], the conversion of M to M~ is given by

M~ (x)

=

e-i

|x|2 2f

M(x)

.

(2.9)

Let the lens radius d and consider the hemisphere screen specified as {(xs, ys, zs)|x2s + ys2 + zs2 = f 2}. (See Fig. 2.) The wave function on the screen I(xs) is expressed as the sum of
wave functions which are emitted from every point on the lens:

I(xs) =

(2.11)

To form the bulk image through the field propagating in the bulk, we regard the response O(t, , ) as the incident wave M(x) and evaluate (2.11). Let us suppose to observe the incident wave at some point on the AdS boundary. We depicted a schematic picture of our setup in Fig. 3. The incident wave is diffracted by a convex lens located at the observation point  = obs on the AdS boundary and built its image on the hemisphere screen located at the outer focus length. To apply (2.11) to the response, we need to transform the S2 coordinate on the AdS boundary (, ) to a Cartesian coordinate on the lens {(xL, yL)|x2L + yL2 = d2}. First, the Cartesian coordinate on the AdS boundary is given as

x(, ) = sin  cos  , y(, ) = sin  sin  , z(, ) = cos  .

(2.12)

­4­

Next, rotate it around the y-axis so that the observation point  = obs comes to the north pole. The rotated Cartesian coordinate (x , y , z ) is

x (, , obs) = cos obs x(, ) - sin obs z(, ) , y (, ) = y(, ) , z (, , obs) = sin obs x(, ) + cos obs z(, ) .

(2.13) (2.14) (2.15)

Then, the rotated S2 coordinate ( ,  ) on the AdS boundary is

y (, )  (, , obs) = arccos z (, , obs) ,  (, , obs) = arctan x (, , obs) . (2.16)
Finally, we take a sufficiently small patch around  = 0 ( = obs) on the AdS boundary, and regard ( ,  ) as the radial coordinate and the angular coordinate on the lens, respectively. Therefore, we obtain the following transformation formula of (, )  (xL, yL).

xL(, , obs) =  (, , obs) cos  (, , obs) , yL(, , obs) =  (, , obs) sin  (, , obs) .

(2.17) (2.18)

We can construct the bulk image viewed at  = obs by evaluating (2.11) substituted the response function on this coordinate system (xL, yL).
Before going to the next section, let us see the image of l mode spherical wave M(x) = Yl0() Pl(cos ), where Pl is the Legendre function. It may be useful to understand the behavior of the image. We can perform the integration of (2.11) analytically when |x|  d f . In this case, note that Pl(cos ) J0( l ), where l = l(l + 1) and Jn(x) is the Bessel function of the first kind. Then,

Here, (s, s) denote angular coordinates of the hemisphere screen as we depicted in Fig. 2. Notice that the image amplitude of l component |Il(xs)|2 takes some large value at s =

(Although,

of Il(xs) in Fig. 4. Roughly speaking, the l mode component wave yields a ring with a radius

the

transformation

in

(2.11).

Hence,

when

packet of several l mode spherical waves comes into the lens, we see the ring image of a

dominant coefficient mode.

For an intuitive understanding of the image of the black hole, it is convenient to consider

the null geodesic in Sch-AdS4. (See also Ref.[10] for detailed analysis.) We assume that the orbital plane of the null geodesic is in the equatorial plane  = /2. Then, from the

geodesic equation, we have

r2 = 2 - 2v(r) ,

In the following of this paper, we will make the image of linear perturbative electromagnetic field on the background charged scalar and electromagnetic field in background Sch-AdS4 spacetime. We will show what asymptotic coefficients correspond to the source and its response as required. Then, we construct the observable from the response and built its image through (2.11).

3 Holographic superconductor on S2

We consider the s-wave holographic superconductor without the back reaction from the gravity [13]. Consider the following Einstein-Maxwell-charged scalar system, of which Lagrangian density is

where G, R, L, Fµ, Dµ,  are the gravitational constant, the Ricci scalar, the AdS radius, the field strength, the covariant derivative with respect to the background metric and the U (1) gauge field, and the charged scalar field, respectively. In our actual calculations, we take the unit of L = 1. We will consider the scalar field and the U (1) gauge field as the probe fields. This is achieved by taking G  0. (See Ref.[20] for the back reacted case.) Then, we can choose the Sch-AdS4 (2.1) as the background spacetime solution.1 The charged scalar field  and the U (1) gauge field Aµ follows the equations below.

(3.4)

Here, we set (rh) = 0 as the U (1)-gauge condition. The constant  is the U (1)-charge. In this solution, the charged scalar field is trivial and U (1)-gauge symmetry in the bulk is preserved. This solution has been identified as the normal phase of the superconductor [13]. As we increase the charge  for a fixed horizon radius rh, the normal phase solution (3.4)
1We will consider both of the small (rh < L) and large (rh  L) black hole branches. The CFT dual of the small black hole has been studied in several literature [21­26]. In the CFT dual of the small black hole, we would be able to see the its image.

­7­

becomes unstable against the charged scalar field perturbation [12]. At the onset of the instability, there is a normal mode of the charged scalar field perturbation. We can extend the normal mode to a nonlinear regime. Such a solution has the charged scalar hair and the U (1)-symmetry is spontaneously broken. This solution has been identified as the superconducting phase of the superconductor.
Let us explicitly construct the solution in the superconducting phase. Under the spherically symmetric ansats,  = (r) and Aµ = (r)tµ, equations of motion (3.2) become

(3.6)

We again set (rh) = 0 as the U (1)-gauge condition. We can also assume that (r) is a real valued function by choosing its appropriate phase. Then, solving the above equations near the horizon, we obtain the regularity condition of the charged scalar field as  (rh) = -2 /(3rh), where we define the horizon value of the scalar field as

 (rh) , q  rh2 (rh)

(3.7)

Thus, the regular solution at the horizon is parameterized by three parameters, (rh, , q) in the unit of L = 1. On the other hand, the asymptotic behaviours of these fields near the AdS boundary are

(1) (2)



(r  ) =

(r  ) = µ - + · · · , r

(3.8)

where (1), (2), µ,  are constants with respect to r. As a new condition, we impose (1) = 0. This condition determines the value of q for fixed rh and . Therefore, the solutions satisfying the boundary conditions at the horizon and the infinity are specified
by the two parameters (rh, ). Then, for a fixed horizon radius rh, we can regard the other constants as functions of like q( ), (2)( ), µ( ), ( ). Figs.5, 6 and 7 show the functional profiles of QFT values (2)( ), µ( ) and ( ), respectively.

In the boundary QFT point of view, it is convenient to specify the solutions by µ or (2) since we can regard them as the chemical potential and the order parameter of the corresponding QFT respectively, according to the GKP-Witten relation. However, we will choose as the parameter specifying the solution in this paper, because we focus on phenomena on the gravity side. We can easily map (rh, ) to quantities of QFT using Figs. 5, 6 and 7.
In Fig. 8, we show the behaviour of (2) with respect to the Hawking temperature T (rh) for constant  surface. We can see (2) rapidly goes to zero at some temperature. This shows the condensation of the scalar field under a critical temperature, which corresponds to the condensation of the Cooper pair during the superconducting phase in QFT.

4 Linear perturbation on the holographic superconductor

We will consider the charged scalar and the U (1) gauge field perturbations on the background. The background solutions are obtained in the previous section. We impose the boundary conditions for perturbation fields as if there exists a point source for the U (1) gauge field on the AdS boundary at the south pole. Then we observe its response through a lens at some observation point on the AdS boundary, as we depicted in Fig. 3.
The linear perturbative equations of motion are

 and  are the background solution as obtained in the previous section and Dµ = µ+itµ is the gauge covariant derivative. We decompose the perturbation into the vector and scalar modes. Since we will only consider the axisymmetric external source in the boundary theory, we focus on axisymmetric linear perturbation: Aµ =  = 0.

­9­

4.1 Vector mode perturbation
In the following, we will study the vector mode perturbation. In S2, the vector spherical harmonics (Ylm())i simply relate to the scalar spherical harmonics Ylm() as

(Ylm(, ))i = ijD^ jYlm(, ) (l  1) ,

(4.3)

where D^ and ij are the covariant derivative and the Levi-Civita tensor on the unit S2. We can decompose the axisymmetric vector mode by the vector spherical harmonics as


Aa = 0 , Ai = e-it cll(r)(Yl0())i ,  = 0 ,
l=1

(4.4)

where a, b = t, r and i, j = , . Here, we consider the monochromatic wave with the frequency . The constant cl is defined in Eq. (2.8). The equation of motion for l(r) is given by the Schrödinger form as

d2 - dr2 +

l(l + r2

1)

+

22

F (r) l(r) = 2l(r) .

(4.5)

We impose the in-going wave condition at the horizon dl/dr|r=rh = -il|r=rh. We also set the normalization condition at the AdS boundary l|r= = 1. Then, the asymptotic
form of the gauge field Ai becomes





Ai|r= = e-it cl(Yl0())i = e-it ij D^ j ( clYl0) = e-it ij D^ j g() ,

l=1

l=1

(4.6)

where g() is the Gaussian function defined in Eq. (2.8). According to the AdS/CFT
dictionary, Ai|r= correspond to the external source in the boundary theory. The above equation implies that the spatially localized time-periodic external electromagnetic field is applied to the superconductor on S2.
The asymptotic solution of l(r) near the AdS boundary is

l(r  ) = 1 + l(1) + · · · . r
Then the response (i.e., electric current) for the vector mode is given as follows:

(4.7)


JiV (t, ) = e-it cll(1) (Ylm())i = e-it ij D^ j J V () ,
l=1

(4.8)

where


J V ()  cll(1)Ylm() + const .
l=1

(4.9)

See Appendix B for details. The constant term in JV () is ambiguous. We determines it

so that

d 0

d

J V ()

= 0 is satisfied. We will use

J V ()

to construct the image of

the black hole. We will numerically solve Eq. (4.5) to obtain the response.

­ 10 ­

4.2 Scalar mode perturbation

We will focus on the scalar mode perturbative solutions. We decompose the scalar mode by the scalar harmonics as


Aa = clala(t, r)Yl0(),
l=1 
Ai = cll(t, r)D^ iYl0(),
l=1 
 = cll(t, r)Yl0() .
l=1

(4.10) (4.11) (4.12)

where cl is the constant defined in Eq. (2.8). Since the Maxwell field does not have dynamical
degrees of freedom for l = 0, we only consider l  1. We will impose the gauge condition as l(t, r) = 0. Notice that since we consider 2 dimensional vector space, the l-component of the field strength falb(t, r) has only one degree of freedom. That is, we can describe it by the scalar function f l(r) and the complete asymmetric tensor density ab as

(4.13)

Then, in the following analysis, we will deal with f l(t, r) instead of ala(t, r) itself. The equation of motions for f l(t, r), l(t, r) and l(t, r) are summarized as

We impose the in-going wave condition at the horizon r = rh as

to the vector mode. Then, we will solve Eqs. (4.14) and (4.15) on the following boundary

condition.

f l(1) = -l(l + 1), l(1) = l(1) = 0

(4.20)

It is also shown in Appendix A that, near the infinity, we can reproduce ala(t, r) from f l(t, r)

as

ala(t, r)

1 l(l + 1)

baDbf l(t, r)

.

(4.21)

The first condition in Eq. (4.20) is equivalent to the boundary conditions alt|r= = 1. Therefore, as the external electromagnetic field in the superconductor, we have


At|r= = e-it clYl0() = e-it(g() - g0) ,

(4.26)

4.3 Imaging black hole from the dissipation part of the response function
Response functions are complex valued functions. Both of their real and imaginary parts are observable. For the vector mode, the external electric field in S2 is given by

Ei = -Fti = -tAi|r= = ijD^ jg() sin t ,

(4.27)

where we took the real part of Eq. (4.6). As its response, we obtain the electric current as

JiV (t, ) = ijD^ j Re J V () cos t + Im J V () sin t .

(4.28)

Again we used the real part of Eq. (4.8). The first term in the electric current has

the phase difference /2 with respect to the electric current. (Borrowing the terminol-

ogy from electric circuit theory, we can regard Re JV () and Im JV () as the "reac-

tance" and "resistance", respectively.) Only Im JV () contributes to the Joule heating,

Q = limT 

T -T

/(2T ).

The same applies to the scalar mode.

We will refer

­ 12 ­

Im JV,S() as dissipation parts of the response functions since the "real" and "imaginary" parts do not have proper meanings. (We can exchange their roles by the constant shift of the time, t  t + /(2).)
In the previous works [10, 11], the response function is directly used for constructing the image of the black hole as explained in section.2. In this paper, we propose a new prescription for constructing a clear image of the black hole: We use dissipation parts of the response functions for constructing the image of the black hole. i.e., M(x) = Im JV,S() in Eq. (2.11). We can understand that the dissipation part of the response has clear information about the photon sphere as follows. Let us consider the response function in l-space, l(1) and f l(0). In the normal phase, (r) = 0, perturbation equations for vector and scalar modes are identical and given by Schrödinger form (4.5). When the "energy" 2 is larger than the top of the potential l(l + 1)vmax, the wave sent from the AdS boundary directly plunges into the black hole and there should be a non-negligible dissipation (or Joule heating in the QFT). Thus, Iml(1) and Imf l(0) are also non-negligible. On the other hand, when 2 is smaller than the top of the potential, Iml(1) and Imf l(0) are suppressed by
 the tiny tunneling probability. It follows that they suddenly become small at l / vmax. This coincides with the angular momentum of the null geodesic on the photon sphere. (See Eq. (2.22).) In Appendix C, we did the detailed WKB analysis and showed that the photon ring appears at (2.23) in the image of the black hole constructed by the formula (2.11).
5 Imaging holographic superconductor
We will show our results of the image of the holographic superconductor system. Let us observe M at some observation point  = obs on the AdS boundary as we depicted in Fig. 3. We will apply the Fourier-Fresnel transformation in Eq. (2.11) to the observables to construct the image.
5.1 Image of vector-mode perturbation
We depicted the image of the vector-mode gauge field perturbation in Fig. 9. The horizontal line and the vertical line are xs/f and ys/f respectively. We set the horizon radius rh = 0.3, frequency  = 80, a lens radius d = 0.5, and variance of Gaussian source  = 0.01. A background scalar value at the horizon varies as = 0.0, 35.0, 41.0, and the observation point varies as obs = 0, 45, 60, 90.
During the normal conducting phase = 0.0, we see a ring image with its radius rs  0.646 at obs = 0. According to Eq. (2.23), the photon ring radius is given by rs 0.647. Therefore, we conclude that the higher-order Einstein ring winding around the vicinity of the photon sphere emerges in the image during the normal conducting phase. As the observation point gets closer to the equator obs = 90, the image transforms from the ring image to 2 bright points. These 2 bright points represent the wave propagating clockwise and counterclockwise on the  = 0 and 180 surfaces.
During the superconducting phase > 0.0, there are some interesting transitions in the image. First, the ring radius shrinks little by little for 0 < 35. This represents

the 2nd order phase transition of the superconductor. For 35 , the ring radius shrinks drastically.
The change of images around  35 can be understood by considering the effective potential Veff . (See Fig. 10.) According to Eq. (4.5), the effective potential is given by:

Veff (r; l, ) =

l(l + r2

1)

+

22

F (r) .

(5.1)

The first term on the right hand side is the gravitational potential, and the second term represents the contribution from the background scalar to the potential. Each term corresponds to the left side potential hill and the right side potential hill, respectively, in Fig. 10. When 2 > Veff (r; l, ) is satisfied for any r, an electromagnetic field falls into the black hole, so the ring images of these l-components do not emerge in the image. When 2  Veff (r; l, ) is satisfied at the maximum of the potential, null rays emitted from the AdS boundary do not fall into the black hole. Particularly when 2 = Veff (r; l, ), null rays propagate in a circular motion at the top of the potential, which we call an effective photon sphere. As discussed in [10, 11] the contribution of the null rays winding around the vicinity of the effective photon sphere is much larger than that with a smaller winding number. Hence, we can roughly expect to see the ring image corresponding to l mode, which satisfies 2 = Veff (r; l, ) at the top of the potential.
During 0 < 35, the gravitational potential is higher than the background scalar

potential. The gravitational potential is lifted by the background scalar field as we raise . Then, 2 grazes the top of the effective potential even for small l. As we saw in Section 2, a small l wave emerges as a small ring. Therefore, the photon ring shrinks gradually as we raise the amplitude of a background scalar field in 0 < 35.
On the other hand, the background scalar potential is higher than the gravitational potential when 35 . Therefore, a drastic change in the image around  35 is originated from such a transition of the potential top Although the ring radius is expected to shrink gradually after the transition as we raise , we could not verify such behavior since the image amplitude falls below the numerical error.
We showed a cross-section view of the black hole image for obs = 0 in Fig. 11. The vertical axis is the amplitude of the image, and the horizontal axis is xs/f . We set rh = 0.3, obs = 0,  = 80, d = 0.5  = 0.01, and varies as = 0.0, 35.0, 41.0. The amplitude decays as we raise since the background potential barrier grows and obstruct a wave propagated from the AdS boundary.
We also depicted the amplitude of the black hole image with respect to the change in a wave frequency in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 respectively. We set rh = 0.3,  = 20, 40, 80 in Fig. 12, and  = 80, rh = 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 in Fig. 13. Besides, we set = 10.0, obs = 0, d = 0.5 and  = 0.01. The vertical line is the image amplitude which is normalized by the maximum amplitude, and the horizontal line is xs/f . A gray dashed line represents

­ 15 ­

the photon sphere radius calculated from the null geodesic approximation. The ring image becomes blurred as we decrease  due to the wave effect. We can see xs/f of the maximum amplitude gets closer to the photon sphere radius calculated from a null ray approximation as we raise . As we raise rh, the ring radius enlarges, since the top of the gravitational potential in Eq. (5.1) becomes smaller. These behaviors are common for both vector and scalar-mode perturbations.

5.2 Scalar-mode perturbation
We showed the image of a scalar-mode gauge field perturbation in Fig. 14. The horizontal line and the vertical line are xs/f and ys/f respectively. We set the horizon radius rh = 0.3, frequency  = 80, the lens radius d = 0.5, and the variance of the Gaussian source  = 0.01. A background scalar value at the horizon varies as = 0.0, 10.0, 45.0, and the observation point varies as obs = 0, 45, 60, 90.
As for a vector-mode perturbation, we see a photon ring at obs = 0 during the normal phase = 0.0. Also, as we vary the observation point from 0 to 90, each ring image tends to be 2 bright points, which is also the same as a vector-mode perturbation qualitatively.
There are 2 critical differences in the image between a scalar-mode and a vector-mode perturbation, which are both originated by the coupling of a gauge field perturbation and scalar field perturbation in (4.14) and (4.15). First, the ring image does not shrink during the superconducting phase. We showed a ring radius with respect to for a scalar-mode and a vector-mode perturbation in Fig. 15. We set rh = 0.3, obs = 0,  = 80, d = 0.5, and  = 0.01. For a vector-mode perturbation, we see a radius gets smaller as we raise , and it shrinks dramatically around  35. In contrast, a radius does not alter for a scalarmode perturbation. We expect a gauge field is scattered by a scalar field perturbation, and observe the effective photon ring with a larger radius compared to a vector-mode perturbation. Second, the image amplitude does not decay as we raise . We depicted the dependence of an image amplitude in Fig. 16 for a scalar-mode and a vector-mode perturbation. We set rh = 0.3, obs = 0,  = 80, d = 0.5, and  = 0.01. For a

vector-mode perturbation, the amplitude decays as becomes larger since the background potential barrier screens the wave propagated from the AdS boundary. For a scalar-mode perturbation, we guess that a gauge field obtains the energy to exceed such a potential barrier due to its excitation by scalar-field. It is difficult to understand these behaviors quantitatively, for example by considering an effective potential, since the equations of motion for scalar-mode perturbations are complicatedly coupled.

6 Conclusion
We proposed a way to take the image of the black hole that is dual to a superconductor. We considered an external time-periodic localized electromagnetic field in the superconductor and its response (i.e., electric current). We applied the Fourier-Fresnel transformation (2.11) to the response function after multiplying the window function. Then, we only considered the dissipation part (or the imaginary part in our convention) of the response function to take the clear image of the black hole. Typical images were summarized in Figs. 9 and 14. We also estimated the radius of the photon ring in the image as a function of the scalar condensate  (rh). For the vector mode, we found the discontinuous change of the radius for a sufficiently large . On the other hand, for the scalar mode, we did not find its discontinuous change. Then, the radius does not depend on much as far as we studied. For the scalar mode, on the other hand, the radius does not depend on so much and we did not find its discontinuous change as far as we studied. Our results indicate that we can observe black holes by the tabletop experiment of superconductors if they have gravitational duals. The observation of black holes can be used as the experimental test of the existence of the gravitational dual for given materials.
We only considered the probe limit of the holographic superconductor. The holographic model with the back reaction to the metric has been considered in Ref.[14]. We can also apply the imaging of the black hole to such a model. It is also interesting to consider the application to the p- or d-wave holographic superconductor models [27, 28].
The other future direction is to apply our method to the Sachdev­Ye­Kitaev (SYK) model [29, 30]. Originally, the SYK model was introduced as the (0+1)-dimensional model but extended to (1+1)-dimensional spacetime [31­35]. The (1+1)-dimensional model is probably a dual of the (2+1)-dimensional black hole. It is interesting to consider the imaging of the black hole dual to the SYK model both on the gravity and field theory sides. There is also an attempt to realize the SYK model in a real experiment [36]. It would be nice if we can observe the black hole through such an experiment.

A Derivation of equations of motion for a scalar-mode perturbation

We will explain the derivation of (4.14) and (4.15) in this section. We start from perturbative Maxwell equations (4.2) and the equations of motion for charged scalar field (4.1) which aa(t, r), (t, r) and (t, r) follow.
First, we focus on the µ = b component of the Maxwell equation:

 F b = J b

(A.1)

­ 18 ­

The right hand side is defined as

J a = cl ja(t, r) + 2||2aa(t, r) Yl0() ,
l
where ja(t, r) is given in (4.16). The left hand side will be

 F b

cl Da r2falc(t, r) - l(l + 1)alc(t, r) Yl0() ,

l

(A.3)

where we defined falb(t, r) in (4.13). By comparing the coefficient of Yl0 on the both hand

sides, we get

Da r2falb(t, r) - l(l + 1) + 2r2||2 alb(t, r) = r2jb .

(A.4)

If we rewrite the above equation using f l(t, r), the µ = b component of Maxwell equation

leads to

Da C(r) Daf l(t, r) + abr2jbl(t, r)

f l(t, r) = r2 .

(A.5)

C(r) is given in (4.17). From Eq. (A.4), we can reproduce alb(t, r) from f l(t, r) as

alb(t, r) = C(r)[ abDaf l(t, r) - r2jb]

(A.6)

By taking the limit of r   in this equation, we have Eq. (4.21). Next, the µ = i component of the Maxwell equation is given by

 F i = J i .

(A.7)

The right hand side will be

The left hand side will be

By comparing both sides, we get

(A.8) (A.9)

Daala(t, r) = -i l(t, r) - l(t, r) .

Finally, the equation of motion of the charged scalar field is

B The source and the response

We will derive an expression of the response (4.8), (4.23) and (4.24) in this section. The Maxwell action in Sch-AdS spacetime is given as

1 S=-
4

d4x-gFµ F µ ,

(B.1)

where g represents a determinant of the metric (2.1). Let us calculate the electric current at the AdS boundary with respect to an infinitesimal change of a boundary value of a gauge field Aµ|r=. Due to a change in Aµ|r=, a gauge field in the bulk also varies as Aµ  Aµ + Aµ. The deviation of the Maxwell action is

Here, we introduced an induced metric on the constant r hypersurface: hIJ ({I, J} =
{t, , }). h is its determinant and nµ is its unit normal vector. We used the Maxwell equation µF µ = 0 at the third equality. Near the AdS boundary, we get hIJ dxI dxJ r2(-dt2 + d2) and nµ r-1(dr)µ. We define the boundary electric current as

JI =

1 S -h~ AI

= -r2F rI |r=

,

(B.2)

where h~ is the determinant of rescaled metric: h~IJ -dt2 + d2 (r  ). The boundary electric current satisfies the conservation law automatically:

I J I = -r2I F rI = 0 .

(4.24).

C WKB analysis

In the normal phase of the holographic superconductor, Maxwell perturbation equations

for vector and scalar modes are identical. They are uniformly written in the Schrödinger

form as

d2 - dr2 + U (r)  = 0 ,

U (r) = -2 + l(l + 1)v(r) ,

(C.1)

where  = l and  = f l for the vector and scalar modes, respectively. The effective

potential v(r) is defined in Eq. (2.20). The asymptotic solution near the infinity is

(r)

=

0

1 r

+

O

1 r2

= 0 - 1r + O(r2) .

(C.2)

In the followings, we will determine the ratio of the source and response, 1/0, by WKB approximation.
Fig. 17 shows the effective potential v(r) for rh = 0.3. The potential has the maximum value vmax defined in Eq. (2.21). For the WKB analysis, we need to consider three cases depending on the number of turning points: l(l + 1)vmax < 2, l(l + 1) < 2 < l(l + 1)vmax, and 2 < l(l + 1).

C.1 l(l + 1)vmax < 2

Firstly, we consider the case of l(l + 1)vmax < 2. There is no turning point in this case and the WKB solution is simply given by

1

r 

(r) = (-U )1/4 exp -i 0 dr -U ,

where we took in-going mode at the horizon. Near infinity r  0, this solution behaves as

Secondly, let us consider the case of 2 < l(l + 1). There is single turning point in this case. We denote the turning point as r = a, i.e., U (a) = 0. For r < a, the WKB solution is

r 

(r < a) = (-U )1/4 exp -i a dr -U .

C.4 WKB and full numerical solutions

Fig. 18 shows 1/0 obtained by the WKB approximation and full numerical calculation. The background is the Schwarzschild-AdS with rh = 0.3. In the WKB analysis, we formally regard l as a continuous parameter. There is a good agreement between them. When the

(C.19)

When /2 + /4 m (m  Z), real and imaginary parts of 1/0 take large values and this is the origin of spikes found in Fig. 18. The modes with /2 + /4 m correspond to "normal modes" trapped in the outside of the potential b < r < 0. (To be precise, they should be regarded as quasinormal modes with tiny damping factors because of the small tunneling probability e-.) Spikes found in the response function is caused by the reflection of the bulk wave at the time like boundary and this phenomena is characteristic

to the asymptotically AdS spacetime. In general, /2 + /4 = m is not exactly satisfied since l is an integer and  takes discrete values. However, depending on the parameters 

and rh, /2 + /4 "accidentally" has a value close to m and then 1/0 becomes large. As discussed in section 2, if the response function has a spiky point at l = l0, we find the ring in the image at sin s = l0/ Therefore, if we make the image from the response function, it can be sensitive on the parameters and this is actually found in our previous work [10, 11]. This is the reason why we proposed the prescription to take only imaginary part of the

response for imaging.

C.5 Analytical calculation of the radius of the photon ring

As we can see in Eq. (C.19) or Fig. 18(b), the imaginary part of the response is exponentially

suppresed in the region of l(l + 1)vmax > 2 because of the tiny tunneling probability e-.

Thus, we would be able to approximate the imaginary part of the respose function as

Im 1 0

2 - l(l + 1)

 (l < / vmax) .

(otherwise)

(C.20)

Let us consider the image of the black hole constructed from this imaginary part of the response function. For simplicity, we consider the case of  = 0, i.e., the external electromagnetic field is given by the delta function.

(C.21)

where cl = (-1)l(2l + 1)1/2/(4)1/2, which is equivalent to Eq. (2.8) with  = 0. The proof is the follows:

where Pl is the Legendre polynomial. At the second equality, we used Pl(-1) = (-1)l. At the third equality, we used the finite-sum-formula for the Legendre polynomial [37]:

(C.23)

For  1, the spherical harmonics is approximated as

Yl0()

l + 1/2 2 J0((l + 1/2)) ,

(C.24)

where Jm is the Bessel function. Since above function is continuous function of l, we have Yn0() Yn+1,0() for n 1 and  1. We also obtain cn+1 -cn for n 1. Then it leads to Eq. (C.21).
From Eq. (C.20), the imaginary part of the response function in the real space is given by

Im O()

 where we define n = / vmax. This is proportional to the single spherical harmonics Yn0.

Then, as shown in section.2, we find the ring at

(C.26)

This coincides with the result of the geodesic approximation (2.23).
