Abstract. Given the independent and identical distributed random variables {Xi} under sublinear expectation E, Peng [12] proved the following law of large numbers:

under uniformly convergence condition limn E[(|X1| - n)+] = 0. This paper shows that above uniformly convergence condition is not necessary, and provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for X1 such that Peng's law of large numbers holds.

1 Introduction

The law of large numbers (LLN for short) is a fundamental limit theorem in probability theory which

plays an important role in the development of probability and statistics. It is well-known that if

{Xi} is an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d. for short) random variables sequence on

probability space (, F , P ) with finite mean E[X1] = х, the weak law of large numbers means that

1 n

n i=1

Xi

converges

to

х

in

probability.

We

note

that

the

probability

P

is

additive.

However,

in

some

areas this apparently quite natural property has been abandoned in favor of non-additive probabilities

(expectation). One typical example of non-additive probabilities (expectation) is Choquet's theory

where Cv[X1] and CV [X1] are lower and upper Choquet integral associated with the given lower and

upper capacities v and V .

Recently, to deal with the problems in risk measures, super-hedge pricing and modeling uncertainty

in finance, Peng [12] systematically studied the sublinear expectation theory. The new notions of

independence and identical distribution are introduced by Peng, and the weak form of the law of

large numbers for i.i.d. sequence {Xi} under sublinear expectation E is obtained under uniformly

convergence condition. If

(1.5)

The typical example of sublinear expectation is the upper expectation, where E can be represented
by E[X] = supP P EP [X], in which P is some set of probability measures. In this case, for each P  P, the conditional expectation EP [Xi|X1, и и и , Xi-1] is dominated by the sublinear expectation E[Xi] for independent random variables {Xi}. Based on this fact, we can give a simple proof of Peng's LLN with the necessary and sufficient conditions. Compared with the classical condition (1.5), Peng's
LLN (1.3) holds if and only if the following three conditions hold:

(i) limn nV (|X1|  n) = 0.

(ii) limn E[X1I{|X1|n}] = E[X1].

(iii) limn -E[-X1I{|X1|n}] = -E[-X1].
Here V is the upper capacity induced by the set of probability measures P in (i). This theorem is a natural generalization of the classical LLN to the sublinear expectation the-
ory. But unlike the classical case, the weak LLN (1.3) maybe not hold even if E[|X1|] < . The counterexample will be provided in the end of this paper.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes some settings of the sublinear expectation theory and the properties of independent random variables. Section 3 provides some inequalities for independent random variables, which are useful tools to prove the main theorem. In Section 4, we study the necessary and sufficient conditions for Peng's LLN. In Section 5, we provide some examples.

2 Preliminaries

Let  be a complete separable metric space, B() be the Borel -algebra of  and M the collection of all probability measures on (, B()). Given a subset P  M, the upper expectation of P is defined as follows: for each random variable X such that EP [X] exists for each P  P,

E[X] := sup EP [X].
P P
It is easy to verify that the upper expectation E[и] of the family P is a sublinear expectation, i.e., it satisfies the following properties:

(1) Monotonicity: E[X]  E[Y ], if X  Y ;

(2) Constant preserving: E[c] = c, c  R;

(3) Sub-additivity: E[X + Y ]  E[X] + E[Y ];

(4) Positive homogeneity: E[X] = E[X],   0.

We can also define the upper probability

V (A) := sup P (A), A  B(),
P P

and the lower probability

v(A) := inf P (A), A  B().
P P

Obviously, V (и) and v(и) are conjugate to each other, that is

V (A) + v(Ac) = 1,

where Ac is the complement set of A. For upper probability V , we can also define the corresponding Choquet expectation CV by



0

CV [X] = V (X > t)dt + (V (X > t) - 1)dt.

-

It is easy to see that E[X]  CV [X].

Definition 2.1. A linear expectation EP is dominated by a sublinear expectation E, if

EP []  E[],   Cb().

Remark 2.2. In general, we can not imply that P  P when EP is dominated by E. If P is convex and weakly compact, then EP is dominated by E is equivalent to P  P, see Li and Lin [7].
We recall the notions of identical distribution and independence in sublinear expectation space, which introduced by Peng [10].

Definition 2.3. Let X and Y be two random variables on (, B()). They are called identically distributed under E, if for each   Cb,Lip(R),

E[(X)] = E[(Y )],

where Cb,Lip(R) is the set of all bounded and Lipschitz functions on R.

Definition 2.4. Let X1, X2, и и и , Xn be a sequence of random variables on (, B()). Xn is said to be independent of (X1, и и и , Xn-1) under E, if for each   Cb,Lip(Rn),

E[(X1, и и и , Xn)] = E[E[(x1 , и и и , xn-1, Xn)]|(x1,иии ,xn-1)=(X1,иии ,Xn-1)].

The sequence of random variables {Xk} k=1 is said to be independent, if Xk+1 is independent of (X1, и и и , Xk) for each k  N.

Proposition 2.5. Let {Xk} be independent sequence of random variables. Then for each nonnegative bounded lower semi-continuous function i,

3 Inequalities for independent random variables

In this section, we provide some inequalities for independent random variables {Xi}. From now on, we say that a linear expectation EP which associates with some probability measure P is dominated by E, if for each n,
EP [(X1, и и и , Xn)]  E[(X1, и и и , Xn)],   Cb(Rn).
Proposition 3.1. Let {Xi} be an independent sequence of random variable under E which satisfies limC E[(|Xi| - C)+] = 0 for i  N and Fi = (X1, и и и , Xi-1) (F1 = {, }). Then for each EP dominated by E, we have

-E[-Xi]  EP [Xi|Fi-1]  E[Xi], i  N.

Proof. Since i = 1 is obvious, we only consider the case of i > 1.

We firstly show that EP [Xi|Fi-1]  E[Xi]. Without loss of generality, assuming E[Xi] = 0, then

for every A  Fi-1 and  > 0, we can choose C large enough

such

that

EP [|(X1, и и и

, Xi-1)

<

,

then

such

that

E[(|Xi| - C)+]

and

EP [IAXi]  EP [(X1, и и и , Xi-1)Xi] + EP [|(X1, и и и , Xi-1) - IA||Xi|]  E[E[(x1, и и и , x1-1)Xi]|(x1,иии ,xi-1)=(X1,иии ,Xi-1)]

+ EP [|(X1, и и и , Xi-1) - IA|(|Xi| - C)+] + CEP [|(X1, и и и , Xi-1) - IA|]  3E[(|Xi| - C)+] + CEP [|(X1, и и и , Xi-1) - IA|] < .

Thus, EP [Xi|Fi-1]  0. Similarly, we can prove that EP [Xi|Fi-1]  -E[-Xi].

The following proposition is the Ottaviani's inequality in the framework of sublinear expectation theory.

Proposition 3.2. Let X1, и и и , Xn be independent random variables under E, Sn =

n i=1

Xi,

and

0 < c < 1 be a real number. If there exist real constants n such that

then,

Proof. For k = 1, и и и , n, let Then We have

Ak = { max |Sl| < 2n, |Sk|  2n},

For fixed k, let (X) = IAk and (X» ) = I{|Sn-Sk|n} - c, where X» = (Xk+1, и и и , Xn) is independent of X = (X1, и и и , Xk), then we can see that  is a bounded lower semi-continuous function on Rn-k and E[(X» )]  0. For each  > 0, there exists P  P and 0    Cb,Lip(R) such that

E[(X)(X» )]  EP [(X)(X» )] + ,

and Then we have,

EP [|(X) - (X)|] < .

E[(X)(X» )]  EP [(X)(X» )] +

 EP [|(X) - (X)|(X» )] + EP [(X)(X» )] +   (1 - c)EP [|(X) - (X)|] + EP [(X)(X» )] +   (2 - c) + E[(X)(X» )] = (2 - c) + sup{E[(X)»(X» )] : »  , »  Cb,Lip(Rn-k)} = (2 - c) + sup{E[(X)]E[»(X» )] : »  , »  Cb,Lip(Rn-k)} = (2 - c) + E[(X)]E[(X» )]
 (2 - c),

which implies that E[(X)(X» )]  0. Finally, by the sub-additivity of E, it follows that

(1 - c)V (max |Sk|  2n)  V (|Sn|  n) +

E[IAk (I{|Sn-Sk|n} - c)]

k=1

 V (|Sn|  n).

The proof is complete.

Remark 3.3. Zhang [14] prove the following Levy maximal inequality, which is used to obtain the
sufficient and necessary conditions for Peng's central limit theorem. Let 0 <  < 1 be a real number and there exist real constants n,k such that V (|Sk - Sn|  n,k + )   for any  > 0, then for every x  R, (1 - )V (maxkn(|Sk| - n,k) > x + )  V (|Sn| > x). Thanks to Proposition 2.5, the -condition can be removed, we have (1 - )V (maxkn(|Sk| - n,k)  x)  V (|Sn|  x) if V (|Sk - Sn|  n,k)   by the similar argument.

4 Law of large numbers

In this section, we complete the proof of Theorem 4.4. We firstly give some lemmas.

Lemma 4.1. Let {X} be a random variable such that limn nV (|X|  n) = 0, then

lim
n

1 n

E[|X

Proof. The proof is very similar to the classical case. Indeed,

(4.1)

The next lemma is the law of large numbers without the moment condition, which was proved in Chen et al. [2]. Thanks to Proposition 3.1, here we give a very simple proof.

E[Xi2],

and

Proposition 3.1 implies that -E[-Yn,i]  EP [Yn,i|Fi-1]  E[Yn,i], where Fi-1 = (X1, и и и , Xi-1).

Firstly, by Chebyshev's inequality and Jensen's inequality, we have

P(

Combining with Lemma 4.1, we can imply that

0,

Similarly,

we

can

prove

that

V

(

Sn n

<

-E[-Yn,1] - )



0,

the

proof

is

completed.

Lemma 4.3.

Let {Xi}

be an

i.i.d.

sequence under E with

хn

=

E[X1I{|X1|n}] and

х

=

-E[-X1I{|X1|n}].

If  > 0,

lim sup{E[( Sn )] - max (х)}  0,

n

n

х
n

ххn

  Cb,Lip(R).

(4.4)

On the other hand, for fixed   Cb,Lip(R) with Lipschitz constant L and bound C, and for each ~ > 0, there exists хn  (хn, хn) such that (хn)  maxхnххn (х) - ~, we can find EP which dominated by E such that {Xi} is an i.i.d. sequence under EP with EP [X1I{|X1|n}] = хn. In this case, by the classical weak law of large numbers, for each  > 0,

P (| Sn n

0.

Then

|EP

We can obtain that

Combining (4.4) with (4.5), we can see that (4.3) holds.

(4.5)

Now we study the sufficient and necessary conditions for Peng's LLN.

Theorem 4.4. Let {Xi} be an i.i.d. sequence under E. Then

lim E[( Sn )] = max (х),

n

n

ххх

  Cb(R).

(4.6)

if and only if the following three conditions hold:

(i) limn nV (|X1|  n) = 0.
(ii) limn E[X1I{|X1|n}] = х.
(iii) limn -E[-X1I{|X1|n}] = х.
Proof. If (i)-(iii) holds, then by Lemma 4.2 and Lemma 4.3, (4.6) holds. Conversely, we assume that (4.6) holds.
Let х^ = 2[х] + 2 > 2х, which is a integer. By (4.6), there exists N such that

V

(|Sn|



nх^ 2

)



1 4

,

n

>

N.

8

Then for N  k  n, we have

V (|Sk

nх^ 2

)



V

(|Sk |

+

V

(|Sn

Applying Ottaviani's inequality, we obtain

which implies that

( max

V

( max

2nх^)

 4V (|Sn|  nх^).

On other hand, by Proposition 2.5,

V ( max |Xk|  4nх^) = 1 - v( max |Xk| < 4nх^)

N +1kn

N +1kn

= 1 - nk=N+1v(|Xk| < 4nх^)

= 1 - (1 - V (|X1|  4nх^))n-N

 1 - e-(n-N )V (|X1|4nх^).

Thus

(n - N )V (|X1|  4nх^)  - ln(1 - 4V (|Sn|  nх^)).

Since

V

as

we

have

Combining with (4.6), we can see that (ii) and (iii) hold.
