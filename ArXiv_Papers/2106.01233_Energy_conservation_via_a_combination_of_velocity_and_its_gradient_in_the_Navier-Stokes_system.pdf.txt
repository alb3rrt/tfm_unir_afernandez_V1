and

v  Lp(0, T ; Lq(T3)) imply the energy equality in homogeneous incompressible Navier-

Stokes equations and together with bounded density with positive lower bound yields the

energy conservation in the general compressible Navier-Stokes equations. This unifies

the known energy conservation criteria via the velocity and its gradient in incompressible

Navier-Stokes equations. This also helps us to extend the conditions via the velocity or

gradient of the velocity for energy equality from the incompressible fluid to compressible

flow and improves the recent results due to Nguyen-Nguyen-Tang [15, Nonlinearity 32

(2019)] and Liang [12, Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A (2020)].

1 Introduction

The compressible Navier-Stokes equations in  × [0, T ) read

t + div (v) = 0, 
(v)t + div (v  v) - div (()Dv) - (µ()div v) + () = 0,
(, v)|t=0 = (0, v0),

(1.1)

where  stands for the density of the flow, v reprents the flow velocity field and ()

is

the

scalar

pressure;

Dv

=

1 2

(v



vT )

is

the

stain

tensor;

()

and

µ()

are

the

viscosity coefficients. The classical isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations (1.2)

and compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate viscosity (1.3) are special cases

of system (1.1) as follows:

t + div (v) = 0, (v)t + div (v  v) + () - 2µv - div v = 0,

and

t + div (v) = 0, (v)t + div (v  v) - div (()Dv) + () = 0.

(1.3)

In this paper, we consider the periodic problem, which means  = T3. The general pressure ()  C1(0, ) and the viscosity coefficients , µ : (0, )  [0, ) are continuous
functions of density.

Formally, the energy conservation in (1.1) is given by, for all t  [0, T ),

In the spirit of well-known Shinbrot's conditions in [19], Yu [23] showed that a weak

solution (, v) of (1.3) or (1.2) satisfies

v  L(0, T ; L2()), v  L2(0, T ; L2()), 0    c < ,   L(0, T ; L2())

v  Lp(0, T ; Lq())

5 12

and q  6,

(1.5)

then the energy conservation (1.4) holds. Subsequently, there has been extensive studies involving energy equality of weak solutions of the compressible flow(see e.g.[1, 6, 10, 12, 15, 17]). Before we present these recent progress, we turn our attention to Shinbrot's conditions in [19] for energy conservation of LerayHopf weak solutions in the homogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Shinbrot extended Lions' condition in [14] v  L4(0, T ; (L4())) for energy conservation to

v  Lp(0, T ; Lq()) with 2 + 2 = 1, q  4. pq

(1.6)

It is worth remarking that condition (1.6) can not yield the full regularity of the weak solutions. The energy conservation condition (1.6) can be replaced by

v  Lp(0, T ; Lq()) with 1 + 3 = 1, 3 < q < 4; pq

(1.7)

which was stated by Taniuchi in [21] and whose proof was given by Beirao da Veiga-Yang in [3]. Very recently, Berselli-Chiodaroli [4] and Zhang [24] obtained energy equality via the following condition,

(1.8)

We turn our attentions back to the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. For equations

(1.2), Chen-Liang-Wang-Xu [7] obtained the energy balance in a bounded domain with

physical boundaries under the following condition v  L(0, T ; L2()), v  L2(0, T ; L2()), 0    c < ,   L(0, T ; L2()),

(1.9)

v  Lp(0, T ; Lq()), p  4, q  6.

For the weak solutions to the general compressible models (1.1), Nguye-Nguye-Tang [15] established the energy conservation criterion below

in

[15],

it

is

a

direct

consequence

of v  L4(0, T ; L4(T3)) (see [3] and the corresponding proof in Theorem 1.1). Conservation

of energy in the incompressible Euler equations is closely related to Onsager's conjecture

[18]. Onsager's conjecture is concerned with the critical regularity of weak solutions in Euler

system to guarantee persistence of energy. In this direction, recent progress can be found

in [2, 5, 8, 9, 11, 16, 17]. As pointed in [15], the generalized Onsager's conjecture for fluid

equations addresses the question how much regularities are needed for a weak solution to

conserve energy. Note that, blow-up criteria only via the density for strong solutions to

the Cauchy problem of compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations in R3 with vacuum,

under the assumptions on the coefficients of viscosity were established in [20, 22]. Roughly

speaking, the upper bound of the density for the strong solution to the 3-D compressible

Navier-Stokes equations yields strong solutions. The strong solutions are expected to meet

energy conservation. Based on this, we try to remove (1.10)2 to obtain the persistence of energy. In addition, it is worth pointing out that Liang [12] recently derived the energy

conservation for isentropic Navier-Stokes equations under the following condition

0 < c1    c2 < , v  L(0, T ; L2(T3)), v  L2(0, T ; L2(T3)),

(1.11)

Inspired by these works, the second objective of this paper is to show (1.10)1 and (1.7) or (1.8) guarantee the energy equality in system (1.1). Before stating the main results, we
introduce the definition of the weak solutions.

Definition 1.1. A pair (, v) is called a weak solution to (1.1) with initial data (0, v0) if (, v) satisfy

(i) equaitons (1.1) hold in D(0, T ; ) and P (), |v|2  L(0, T ; L1()), v  L2(0, T ; L2()),

(ii) (·, t)  0 in D() as t  0, i.e.

lim

(x, t)(x)dx =


0(x)(x)dx,


for every test function   C0().

(1.14) (1.15)

We formulate our fist result as follows
Theorem 1.1. The energy equality (1.4) of weak solutions (, v) to the Navier-Stokes equation (1.1) is valid if one of the following two conditions is satisfied

(1) 0 < c1    c2 <  , v  L(0, T ; L2(T3)), v  L2(0, T ; L2(T3))

Remark 1.1. Compared with result (1.10), conditions 1.16 in Theorem 1.1 only required the bounded density with positive lower bound. Result (1.16) is an improvement of (1.5) without vacuum.

Remark 1.2. We extend the energy conservation critera (1.6)-(1.8) from incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to general compressible Navier-Stokes equations.

Remark 1.3. In contrast with (1.11), the generalization in (1.17) is two fold: first, to improve the corresponding results in (1.17), second, to consider the more general equations.

It should be pointed out that Theorem 1.1 is a direct consequence of the following theorem.

Theorem 1.2. For any dimension d  2, the energy equality (1.4) of weak solutions (, v) to the Navier-Stokes equation (1.1) is valid provided

(1.18)

Remark 1.4. At first glance, energy conservation criteria (1.18) are based on a combination

of velocity and its gradient and are more complicated than (1.16) and (1.17), however, (1.18) together with natural energy v  L(0, T ; L2(T3)), v  L2(0, T ; L2(T3)) leads to (1.16)
and (1.17). For the details, see the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Remark

1.5.

From

and

v



Lp(0, T ; Lq(T3))

means

the energy equality in the classical homogenous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

As mentioned in latter remark, this result covers the (1.6)-(1.8), hence, roughly speaking,

this unifies the known energy conservation criteria via the velocity and its gradient in

incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

Remark 1.6. We follow the path of [15] to prove Theorem 1.2. The new ingredient is the application of the following inequality



(v) 

C
Lp (Td )

v

Lp (Td ) .

(1.19)

This help us to pass the limit of pressure term only with the positive bounded density, which removes the additial condition of the density (1.10)2 in [15]. For the proof of (1.19), we refer the readers to Lemma 2.3 (see also [12, page 7]).
Remark 1.7. One can consider Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2 on smooth bounded domain. Combining the framework for bounded domain in [15] and the proof here, one need to deal with the boundary terms caused by integrating by parts. Fortunately, these additional terms are the lower order terms.
Remark 1.8. In dimension d = 2, the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality guarantees that

L(0,T ;L2(T2))

L2(0,T ;L2(T2))



C.

Therefore, according to Theorem 1.2, the bounded density with positive lower bound and natural energy yield the energy conservation of the weak solutions.

Finally, as [15], one can establish the results parallel to Theorem 1.1 and 1.2 for the non-homogenous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations below

t + div (v) = 0,   (v)t + div (v  v) - div (()Dv) +  = 0,
div v = 0,   (, v)|t=0 = (0, u0),

(1.20)

we leave this to the interested readers.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted the auxiliary lemmas involving mollifier and the key inequality (1.19). In section 3, we first present the proof of Theorem 1.2. Then, based on Theorem 1.2, we complete the proof of Theorem1.1.

2 Notations and some auxiliary lemmas
First, we introduce some notations used in this paper. For p  [1, ], the notation Lp(0, T ; X) stands for the set of measurable functions on the interval (0, T ) with values in
5

X and f (·, t) X belonging to Lp(0, T ). The classical Sobolev space W k,p() is equipped

k

with the norm f W k,p() =

Df Lp(). The space Cb() is the bounded smooth

=0

functions on . For simplicity, we denote by

t

t

f (x,  )dxd =

s Td

s

f and f Lp(0,T ;X) = f Lp(X).

Let  : Rd  R be a standard mollifier.i.e.

(x)

=

C e0

-

1 1-|x|2

for |x| < 1 and (x) = 0

for |x|  1, where C0 is a rescaled mollifier (x) =

1cdon(sxt)a.ntFsourchantyhafut ncRtdion(xf)dx

= 1. For  L1loc(), its

> 0, we mollified

define the version is

defined as

f (x) = (f  )(x) = f (x - y)(y)dy, x  ,
Rd

where  = {x   : d(x, ) > }.

We first recall the results involving the mollifier established in [15].

Lemma 2.1. ([15]) Suppose that f  Lp(0, T ; Lq(Td)). Then for any  > 0, there holds

f  Lp(0,T ;Lq(Td))  C -1 f Lp(0,T ;Lq(Td)),

(2.1)

and, if p, q < 

lim sup  f  Lp(0,T ;Lq(Td)) = 0.
0

Moreover, if 0 < c1  g  c2 < , then there holds, for any  > 0,



f g

Lp(0,T ;Lq(Td)),

(2.2)

and if p, q < 

lim sup 
0



f g

= 0.
Lp(0,T ;Lq(Td))

(2.3)

The next lemma with p = q, p1 = q1, p2 = q2 was proved in [15]. We generalize it by extending the integral norms with different exponents in space and time.

Lemma

2.2.

Let 1  p, q, p1, p2, q1, q2   with

1 p

=

1 p1

+

1 p2

and

1 q

=

1 q1

+

1 q2

.

Assume

f  Lp1(0, T ; W 1,q1 (Td)) and g  Lp2(0, T ; Lq2 (Td)). Then for any  > 0, there holds

(f g) - f g Lp(0,T ;Lq(Td))  C  f Lp1 (0,T ;W 1,q1 (Td)) g Lp2 (0,T ;Lq2 (Td)).

(2.4)

Moreover, if q1, q2 <  then lim sup -1 (f g) - f g Lp(0,T ;Lq(Td)) = 0.
0

(2.5)

Proof. Thanks to the fact observed in [9] and the ideas in [13], we know that (f g) - f g = R - (f  - f )(g - g),

(2.6)

6

where

R(x, s) := (f (y, s) - f (x, s))(g(y, s) - g(x, s))(x - y)dy.
Rd
Triangle inequality yields that

(f g) - f g Lq(Td)  R Lq(Td) + (f - f )(g - g) Lq(Td).

(2.7)

(2.11)

In combination with (2.6), (2.9) and (2.11) and using the H¨older's inequality, we can deduce the result (2.4).
Furthermore, if q1, q2 < , let {fn}, {gn}  Cb(Td) with fn  f, gn  g strongly in W 1,q1 and Lq2, respectively. Thus, by the density arguments, we find that

(f g) - f g Lq  C ((f (g - gn)) + (f gn) - f (g - gn) - f gn Lq )  C ( (f (g - gn)) - f (g - gn) Lq + (f gn) - f gn Lq )
 C  f Lq1 g - gn Lq2 + 2 fn Lq1 gn Lq2 ,

(2.12)

which means

-1 (f g) - f g Lq  C ( f Lq1 g - gn Lq2 +  fn Lq1 gn Lq2 ) ,

(2.13)

hence, as n   and   0, we infer that

(2.14)

Then, we have completed the proof of Lemma 2.2.

The next lemma is the critical point to remove (1.10)2.

Lemma 2.3. Assume that 0 <   (x, t)   <  and v  W 1,p(Td) with 1  p  .

Then

Let B(x, ) = {y  ; |x - y| < }, then Using the H¨older's inequality, we have

3 Proof of theorem 1.1 and 1.2

In this section, we first present the proof of Theorem 1.2. Then, making the use of interpolation and the natural energy, we prove Theorem 1.1 by the results of Theorem 1.2.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Multiplying (1.1)2 by

(3.9)

Next, we need to prove that the terms on the right hand-side of (3.9) tend to zero as   0.

It follows from Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 2.2 that
div (()Dv) L2L2  C-1 ()Dv L2L2  C-1 v L2(L2), lim sup  div (()Dv) L2L2 = 0,
0
(v) - v L2(L2)  C  L(L) v L2(W 1,2).

(3.10)

We derive from this and the H¨older's inequality that

t s

(

()Dv)

(v) - 

v

C

div (()Dv)

L2 (L2 )

(v) - v 

L2 (L2 )

C div (()Dv) L2(L2)  LL v L2(W 1,2).

(3.11)

As a consequence, we get

lim sup
0

t s

div

( ()Dv)

(v) - 

v

= 0.

11

Likewise, there holds

lim sup
0

t s

(µ()div

v)

(v) - 



v

= 0.

(3.12)

By means of the triangle inequality, the H¨older inequality and Lemma 2.3, we obtain

(3.13)

which implies that

At this stage, it is enough to show

and

(3.15)

Applying Lemma 2.2, we obtain that

lim sup

(v) 

2p 2q = 0.
L p-1 (L q-1 )

(3.16)

Using the H¨older's inequality and Lemma 2.1, we find

which in turn implies

lim sup

(v) 

[(v  v) - (v)  v]

= 0.

12

We turn our attentions to the term

t s

we derive from Lemma 2.1 that

v - (v)

2p

2q

Since v  L p-1 (L q-1 ),

lim sup

(v) 

2p 2q = 0.
L p-1 (L q-1 )

(3.18)

In addition, we conclude from Lemma 2.2 that

v - (v) LpLq  C v LpW 1,q  LL .

(3.19)

Using the H¨older's inequality and (3.19), we find,

t s

v - (v)

v - (v) Lp(Lq)

Together this with (3.18) yields that

We complete the proof of Theorem 1.2.

()|Dv|2 = 0, µ()|div v|2 = 0.

We are in a position to prove Theorem 1.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. (i) The natural energy gives v  L2(0, T ; W 1,2(T3)). Choosing p =

q = 2 in (1.18), we immediately prove that the condition v  L4(0, T ; L4(T3)) yields energy

equality. It is worth remarking that the rest proof in (1.16) can be reduced to this special

case.

Next,

we

first deal the cases

(1.16) in Theorem

1.1

with q

 4 and

2 p

+

2 q

= 1.

The

Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality guarantees that

(q-4)

v

2q-4
L(0,T ;L2(T3))

v

2q-4
Lp(0,T ;Lq(T3))



C.

(3.21)

where we have used q  4. From the the result just proved, we obtain energy equality via

(1.16) with q  4.

We

consider

(1.16)

with

3

<

q

<

4

and

1 p

+

3 q

=

1.

Using

the

Gagliardo-Nirenberg

inequality

again, we know that

3(4-q)

q

v

L4(0,T ;L4(T3))  C

v

2(6-q)
L2(0,T ;L6(T3))

v

2(6-q)

q

v

2(6-q)
Lp(0,T ;Lq (T3))



C.

(3.22)

13

We finish the proof of (1.16).

Now, we focus on the proof of (1.17). Indeed, note that v  Lp(0, T ; W 1,q(T3)), therefore,

according

to

Theorem

1.1,

it

suffices

to

derive

v

(3.24)

In

Finally,

for

(3.26)

We conclude the desired result from Theorem 1.2. The proof of this theorem is completed.
