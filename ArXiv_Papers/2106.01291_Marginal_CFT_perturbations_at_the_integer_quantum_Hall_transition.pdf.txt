Abstract According to recent arguments by the author, the conformal field theory (CFT) describing the scaling limit of the integer quantum Hall plateau transition is a deformed level-4 Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model with Riemannian target space inside a complex Lie supergroup GL. After a summary of that proposal and some of its predictions, the leading irrelevant and relevant perturbations of the proposed CFT are discussed. Argued to be marginal, these result in a non-standard renormalization group (RG) flow near criticality, which calls for modified finite-size scaling analysis and may explain the long-standing inability of numerical work to reach agreement on the values of critical exponents. The technique of operator product expansion is used to compute the RG-beta functions up to cubic order in the couplings. The mean value of the dissipative conductance at the RG-fixed point is calculated for a cylinder geometry with any aspect ratio.

1 Introduction
The integer quantum Hall (IQH) transition is the critical phenomenon that takes place when a two-dimensional electron gas in the integer quantum Hall regime is driven from one Hall plateau to the next one by varying, e.g., a magnetic field. With disorder playing a major role, the IQH transition belongs to the class of Anderson localization-delocalization transitions and as such holds the potential to serve as a paradigm for Anderson transitions [10] in low dimension and between different phases of topological matter.
The study of critical properties at the IQH transition has a long history. Based on the so-called Pruisken-Khmelnitskii two-parameter scaling hypothesis [24, 18], many numerical studies have been undertaken (a small selection of references is [16, 30, 2, 26, 35, 28]) in order to determine the critical exponents for the universal scaling laws governing the transition. Yet, all the numerical work failed to give a consistent and convincing picture and, in spite of considerable efforts that were expended over the years, an analytical understanding of what exactly happens at the critical point also remained elusive.
The latter situation changed recently, when the author developed [38] a conformal field theory description of the scaling limit of the IQH transition. In that quest, several conceptual difficulties had to be overcome, especially some serious obstructions that
1

seemed to rule out any known scenario with a current algebra as derived from a WessZumino-Novikov-Witten (WZW) model. The proposal of [38] shows how the postulate of holomorphic factorization of the algebra of critical currents does come true by a novel mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and it predicts a fixed-point conductivity xx = 2/ (in units of e2/h) and a multifractality spectrum q = q(1 - q)/4 consistent with known numerical results. Moreover, the proposed CFT is a deformed WZW model with the unusual property of admitting several marginal perturbations, which might be expected to correspond to the couplings xy - xy and xx - xx of the two-parameter scaling picture. If so, the marginality implies that the values of the critical exponents 1/ and y measured in numerical experiments are actually ill-defined (they vanish in the true scaling limit of infinite system size), and the renormalization group (RG) flow near the fixed point is logarithmically slow.
To add some perspective to our work, we remark that WZW models had already been discussed 20 years ago as possible field theories of 2D Anderson delocalized criticality. Yet, at that time the consensus was that WZW models suffer from relevant perturbations that could only be avoided by fine-tuning of the disorder, and hence their significance for real physical systems was left in doubt. More recently, however, WZW models for disordered electrons were promoted to physical relevance in the discovery [29] of some 3D topological phases of matter, by their role as RG-stable models describing the 2D surface states of bulk topological insulators and superconductors in the symmetry classes AIII, CI, and DIII [12, 27]. These developments are reviewed in [17]. We note that the WZW model to be discussed here is on a different footing: it is stabilized not by topological protection, but rather by spontaneous symmetry breaking and rank reduction due to strong disorder.
The plan of the paper is as follows. We begin in Section 2 with the conventional scaling hypothesis and its failure as a framework for past numerical work to produce mutually consistent results. In Section 3, we summarize the conformal field theory proposed in [38], review the operator product expansions that follow from its fixed-point Lagrangian, and list a few predictions of the theory. The main part of the paper is Section 4, where we investigate the possible candidates for marginal CFT perturbations and use the method of operator product expansion to compute the RG beta functions for what might be the marginally irrelevant flow into the fixed point. Section 5 calculates the disorder average of the dissipative conductance for a cylinder of length L and circumference W , in the scaling limit L   (keeping W/L fixed) at criticality.

2 Scaling hypothesis

The first attempt to gain an analytical understanding of the integer quantum Hall tran-

sition was made by Pruisken and collaborators [24]. Building on the theory of weak lo-

calization for metals in a weak magnetic field, they wrote down a field-theory Lagrangian

that has the dissipative conductivity xx and the Hall conductivity xy for its two coupling

parameters:

L

=

xx 8

µ

STr µQ Q

+

xy 8

µ

STr QµQ  Q.

(1)

The field Q of that so-called nonlinear sigma model is a matrix which can be diagonalized

with two eigenvalues, +1 and -1:

Q = u3u-1,

3 =

+1 0

0 -1

.

(2)

(Note that this is relevant information in view of our assertion [38] that the diagonalizability of Q is actually lost at the RG-fixed point for the critical system.) The precise nature of the matrix Q depends on whether one assumes the replica trick with bosonic or fermionic fields or employs the Wegner-Efetov supersymmetry method [9, 31]. Here we use the latter, where STr  Treven - Trodd stands for the supertrace, and u  U  U(r, r|2r), with r the number of field copies needed to express a given observable of interest.
Assuming the renormalizability of Pruisken's Lagrangian in conjunction with what should happen in limiting cases, the model's RG flow was conjectured by Khmelnitskii [18]. Its central feature is an RG-fixed point at xy = 1/2 (in units of e2/h) and an unknown value of xx . Now while this so-called Pruisken-Khmelnitskii scaling picture of the plateau transition inspired a lot of activity, it has to be said that the Pruisken Lagrangian was never derived in a mathematically controlled manner. In fact, while Pruisken's derivation goes through in a weak magnetic field, it fails in the lowest Landau level, and so does the author's derivation [37] applying the color-flavor transformation to the Chalker-Coddington network model [5] with a single channel. Anyway, the RG-fixed point of Pruisken's model (if such a fixed point exists) lies deep in the strong-coupling regime, so it is not surprising that the model never led to any quantitative predictions about the critical behavior.
Nonetheless, Pruisken's model was construed to underpin the general belief that the renormalization group beta functions (giving the RG flow as a function of the running short-distance cutoff a) are of standard form near the fixed point:

d xx d ln a

=

y

(xx

-

xx)

+

... ,

d xy d ln a

=

 -1 (xy

- xy) + ... ,

(3)

leading to standard critical behavior (with y < 0 < -1), in particular a power-law divergence of the localization length (  |E - Ec|-) near criticality. Based on that belief, many authors have calculated the critical indices  and y by numerical simulation of various models -- we will not go into any details here but simply offer an incomplete list of selected references: [16, 30, 2, 26, 35, 28]. A short synopsis is that the published results for y lie in the range of -1 < y  0 and for  between 2.34 and 2.61 (be informed, however, that a very recent study of a two-channel network model by Dresselhaus, Sbierski, and Gruzberg [8] finds values for  as large as 3.4 and even 3.9).
To explain the discrepancies between all these results, claims have been made that there exists more than one RG-fixed point and hence more than one universality class. In fact, a recent paper [19] goes as far as suggesting that there might be a whole line of fixed points depending on a certain parameter p. In the opinion of the present author, there is no justification for such claims, as they are in conflict with the Harris criterion [15], a well-established and non-perturbative result constraining disordered criticality.
The main purpose of the present paper is to investigate another scenario that has been put forward [38] to explain the discord: the numerical data were analyzed with assumptions that turn out to be incorrect. Basic to our explanation is that the conformal field theory (reviewed in the next section), which emerges as the RG-fixed point, has the following property: its least irrelevant perturbation is marginal, and its most relevant perturbation is also marginal! This means that the RG flow vanishes in the linear approximation for the field-theory couplings (proportional, presumably, to xx - xx and xy - xy); it becomes nontrivial only when nonlinear terms are taken into account. According to that scenario, the exponents y and 1/ measured in numerical experiments are not well-defined (they vanish upon true extrapolation to the asymptotic scaling limit) and, therefore, numerical calculations done in the past failed to give a consistent picture.

3 CFT of RG-fixed point
To describe the scaling limit of the integer quantum Hall transition, this author in [38] proposed a conformal field theory (CFT), which is to be summarized and reviewed in the present section. It should be stressed right away that our theory is not directly related to Pruisken's model. Indeed, the latter is supposed to come from a generalized HubbardStratonovich transformation and its field (Q) has the physical dimension of frequency, whereas the former is derived via non-Abelian bosonization [32] and its field (M ) carries the physical dimension of time or inverse frequency. The full derivation of our CFT requires novel techniques (transcending bosonization) and will be presented elsewhere. A feature worth highlighting is that the CFT target space resides inside a nilpotent adjoint orbit (Q = uQ0u-1 and Q20 = 0) of the global symmetry group U(r, r|2r), following a novel scenario of spontaneous symmetry breaking and rank reduction (2r  r).

3.1 Deformed WZW model

As put forward in [38], the conformally invariant fixed-point theory for the integer quantum
Hall transition is a deformed Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZW) model of fields M :
  X. Its target space X is of type A|A [36], which means that the supermanifold X
complexifies to the complex Lie supergroup XC = GL(r|r) and the base is a direct product X0 ◊ X1 of the positive Hermitian matrices X0  Herm+(r) with the unitary matrices X1  U(r), where r is the number of replicas. The standard WZW action functional is

(4)

Here d =  + Ø, and  = dz z , Ø = dzØ zØ if z, zØ are complex coordinates for the Riemann surface , and the notation d-1 means any two-form potential of the closed three-form . For our case, where  = STr (M -1dM )3, such a potential exists only locally when r  2. With the choice of normalization made, the resulting ambiguity forces the so-called level n (in the literature often denoted by k) to be an integer.
To match the phenomenology of the integer quantum Hall transition (and, in particular, to arrange for the fundamental field M to have vanishing scaling dimension), one needs to deform [38] the standard functional (4) by a truly marginal perturbation with coupling parameter  :

(5)

often called the Gade-Wegner term [13] in the disordered electron literature. In the present paper we will be concerned for the most part with perturbations to the fixed-point theory (5). These were addressed cursorily in [38] but call for more attention.

3.2 Undeformed theory: conserved currents

We begin by reviewing some key properties of the theory (4) before deformation. Foremost among these is an invariance [20] under left and right translations,

M (z, zØ)  gL(z) M (z, zØ) gR(zØ)-1,

(6)

where the mapping gL :   GL(r|r) is holomorphic and gR is anti-holomorphic. The left translations generate a current algebra gl(r|r)n with holomorphic conserved current

(ØJ = 0) defined by

d dt

t=0SnWZW[e-tY M ] =

1 2i

STr J  ØY.


(7)

Inserting e-tY M into the argument of the action functional SnWZW given in Eq. (4) and

linearizing in tY , one finds

J = n M ∑ M -1.

(8)

Similarly, the algebra, with

right translations M  M anti-holomorphic conserved

JØ = -n M -1ØM.

(9)

The latter current is defined by

d dt

t=0SnWZW[M e+tY ]

=

1 2i

STr Y  JØ.


(10)

For later use, we note that J and JØ get exchanged by the transformation

  Ø, M  M -1,

(11)

which is referred to as the "parity" symmetry of the CFT (4). An overarching principle of conformal field theory with continuous internal symmetries
is holomorphic factorization of the algebra of conserved currents. That principle is borne out [33] for the WZW model (4), thanks to the independent left and right actions of the symmetry group. In contrast, holomorphic factorization is not known to occur for Pruisken's model.

3.3 Operator product expansions

In WZW models, one can in principle compute everything from the field-theory Lagrangian, with a major reason being that one has a direct handle on the operator product expansions. A few details are reviewed below. We adopt the convention to write J  J(z) dz, i.e., J stands for the one-form of the current while J(z) denotes the coefficient matrix of the current one-form in the coordinates z, zØ.
One starts from the fact that the holomorphic current J, by its very definition from Eq. (7), generates left translations of the fundamental field M . That property fixes the operator product expansion (OPE) of J with M :

J

 

(z)M

 

(w,

wØ)

=

-(-1)||

M

 

(w,

wØ)

z-w

+...

.

(12)

Here || denotes the fermion degree, i.e. || = 0 and || = 1 for bosonic and fermionic indices , respectively. The ellipses in (12) stand for terms which are finite or zero in the limit of coinciding points (z  w). Now for the purpose of book keeping, let us introduce constant parameter supermatrices A, B and set

JA(z)  STr AJ(z) .

(13)

Then Eq. (12) can be equivalently written in the index-free form

J A(z)

∑

STr M (w, wØ)B

=

-STr

A

M (w, wØ) z-w

B

+

.

.

.

.

(14)

5

Similarly, one has

JØA(zØ) ∑ STr BM (w, wØ) = +STr B M (w, wØ) A + . . . .

(15)

zØ - wØ

By applying the OPE (14) to the expression (8) for J in terms of M , one obtains the OPE of the current with itself:

J A(z)J B (w)

=

-n

STr AB (z - w)2

+

J [A,B](w) z-w

+

...

,

(16)

which features a leading singular term proportional to the quantized level n. The very same OPE (with J  JØ, z  zØ, and w  wØ) holds for the anti-holomorphic current.
Next, by implementing the CFT principle that the holomorphic current J be a primary field of conformal dimension 1 for the Virasoro algebra generated by the holomorphic part, T (z), of the stress-energy tensor, i.e.,

T (z)JA(w)

=

J A(w) (z - w)2

+

wJ A(w) z-w

+

...

,

(17)

one uses (16) to find an exact expression for the latter:

T (z)



Tgl(r|r)n,

=

(-1)||+1 2n

J

 

(z)J

(z)

+

(-1)||+|| 2n2

J

 

(z)J

 

(z).

(18)

Finally, by using Eq. (18), the OPE (12), and the associativity of the operator algebra, one infers how M transforms under the conformal group generated by T (z):

T (z)M (w,

wØ)

=

h

M (w, wØ) (z - w)2

+

wM (w, wØ) z-w

+

.

.

.

,

h

=

1 2n2

.

(19)

Here we omitted the indices of the supermatrix M (w, wØ). Since the current algebra for JØ is the same, all the same formulas (with z  zØ, etc.) hold on the anti-holomorphic side.
To conclude this subsection, let us draw attention to a phenomenon of rank reduction: the current algebra at work, namely gl(r|r)n , has a rank which is only half of that of the global symmetry group U = U(r, r|2r).

3.4 Deformed theory

3.4.1 Conserved currents

We now turn on the deformation in (5) with parameter . The first question to address is what happens to the conserved currents. These are still defined by the continuous symmetry under left and right translations:

d dt

t=0SnW,ZW[e-tXL M etXR ] =

1 2i



STr JL  dXL - STr JR  dXR .

(20)

By computing the additional terms due to the deformation (5), one finds the expression

for the deformed right current. Here one needs to appreciate the appearance of an exact term, d STr ln M . Omitted in [38], that term is negligible for certain purposes: it drops out of the total current JL + JR (from which the physical observables are computed), and the equations of motion (dJL = 0 = dJR) imply that the deformed currents with the exact term omitted are still holomorphic resp. anti-holomorphic, giving rise to good current algebras. Nonetheless, the exact term does affect some of the operator product expansions of the deformed CFT, and we shall therefore be careful not to omit it here.
Let us add the remark that the deformation (5) preserves the symmetry under parity, (11). By consequence, parity still exchanges the deformed currents (JL  JR).

3.4.2 Marginality of deformation

The main goal of the present paper is to compute the renormalization group flow of the deformed theory (5) in the presence of various perturbations of physical interest. For that task, our main goal is the method of operator product expansion. Now as we have remarked, the appearance of the exact term d STr ln M in the expressions (21, 22) for the deformed currents has an effect on operator products. That is a nuisance when doing perturbative calculations of higher order and presents us with a dilemma. Our resolution is to do perturbation theory around the undeformed WZW action functional of Eq. (4). In other words, we shall lump all of the deformation in (5) with whatever perturbation is being considered. Such an approach would be unlikely to be manageable for a general deformation. However, the deformation at hand is an Abelian current-current perturbation, which makes for substantial simplifications.
Most importantly, the deformation (5) is a truly marginal perturbation of the CFT (4), i.e. the coupling  does not flow under renormalization. Let us briefly discuss this fact, introducing along the way some notation that will be useful later. We abbreviate

STrJ(z) STrJØ(zØ)  OA(z, zØ),

(23)

to cast the deformation in (5) in the form

-

i 4

STr (M -1M )




STr (M -1ØM )

=

 2n2

d2z OA(z, zØ)  S ,

(24)

where d2z  |dx  dy| stands for the area element of . It is clear that our perturbation (24) is marginal in linear order. Indeed, being a
product of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic currents, OA is a Virasoro-primary field with conformal dimension (1,1), so its integral d2z OA has total scaling dimension 1+1-2 = 0. To go beyond the linear approximation, we expand:

e-S

=

1 - S

+

1 2!

S2

-

1 3!

S3

+...

.

(25)

The simplifying feature here is that, by Eq. (16) and STr 1 = 0 and [1, 1] = 0, the OPE

STr

(26)

contains no singular terms (the same holds, of course, on the anti-holomorphic side), and

hence the limit

OA(w,

(27)

is finite, and so are all operator products in the expansion (25). By standard reasoning

(which will be explicated in much detail below), the true marginality of S follows.

3.4.3 Zero scaling dimension of M
The physical meaning of our WZW field M is that represents the local density of states (or the absolute value squared of a critical wave function [38]) of the underlying disordered electron model. From that correspondence, one knows that M must have vanishing scaling dimension. We are now going to demonstrate that this requirement fixes the deformation parameter to be  = 1.
To begin, we recall from the OPE (19) that M is a Virasoro-primary field with conformal dimension (1/2n2, 1/2n2) in the undeformed theory (4). This means that under a change of cutoff scale a  a, the local field M (z, zØ) (indices omitted) renormalizes as

M (z, zØ)  a/a -1/n2 M (z, zØ).

(28)

Our task is to compute the modification of this law due to the CFT deformation S. In preparation for that, we apply Eqs. (14, 15) to compute the OPE with OA(z, zØ):

OA(z,

zØ)

∑

M (0)

=

-

1 |z|2

M (0)

+

.

.

.

.

(29)

Thus, for the linear term in the Taylor series (25) we have

-

S

∑

M (0)

=

 2n2

d2z |z|2

M (0)

+

.

.

.

.

(30)

We then see that raising the cutoff a  a has the following effect:

-

S

∑

M (0)

a

+

S

∑

M (0)

a

=

 n2

ln(a/a) M (0)

+

...

.

(31)

Owing to the simplicity of the OPE (29), it is straightforward to extend this calculation to all orders in  ; alternatively, we may take the increment in a/a = (a+da)/a = 1+d ln a to be infinitesimal and stop at the linear order (31) to derive the differential equation that determines the renormalization of the local field M (0). Either way, we find that the conformal dimension of M (in the deformed CFT with parameter ) is exactly given by

(h, hØ) =

1- 2n2

,

1- 2n2

.

(32)

Since the phenomenology of IQHT calls for h = hØ = 0, it follows that  = 1.

3.4.4 Some predictions at criticality

Beyond reproducing known results, the CFT (5) predicts many new ones, which can be
verified by numerical simulation of critical models. Here we mention just a few.
Firstly, an observable that has received much attention [11, 25, 3, 4] is the spectrum of multifractal scaling exponents, q , defined as the scaling dimensions of powers |(∑)|2q of critical wave functions. These can be calculated in the present theory with a single replica
(r = 1), in which case M is simply a 2 ◊ 2 supermatrix:

(n  N).

(34)

By matching to the existing numerical results for q one infers that n = 4. Secondly, the operator product expansion (16) for the current algebra gl(r|r)n gives
access to several current-current correlation functions of physical interest, at criticality. Foremost among these is the correlation function between derivatives of retarded and advanced single-electron Green's functions,

(35)

which enters the Kubo-Greenwood linear-response formula for the conductivity xx . That correlation function is represented in the CFT (still with a single replica, r = 1) by

J 10(∑)J 01(∑) + JØ10(∑)JØ01(∑) ,

(36)

which has a leading short-distance singularity proportional to n from (16). By computing

the correlation function (36) in the perturbative short-distance regime of a finite system

with absorbing boundaries, one infers the value of the fixed-point dissipative conductivity

as

(n = 4),

(37)

see Section 5.0.1. (See also Section 5.0.2 for the exact calculation.)

Thirdly, it is possible to compute the mean dissipative conductance in the scaling limit

of a cylinder geometry with any aspect ratio; see Section 5.

4 Marginal perturbations
In the traditional framework of two-parameter scaling theory based on Pruisken's nonlinear sigma model, one envisages two leading perturbations to the renormalization-group (RG) fixed point: a relevant one given by xy - xy , and an irrelevant one, by xx - xx . A conservative approach ought to try and rescue as much of that framework as possible. In that vein, we now look for two perturbations of the above kind for the CFT (5).

4.1 Ruling out a natural candidate

We start our investigation of perturbations of the fixed-point theory (5) by considering

Spert

=

i 2

STr J  M JØM -1,

(38)

which would seem to be a natural candidate for our purposes. It turns out, however, that the perturbation (38) is ruled out by the phenomenology to be matched. Truth be told: that no-go scenario came as a surprise to this author; we shall now present the details.
To linear order in the coupling, the RG flow of the perturbation is controlled by the operator product expansion (OPE) with the stress-energy tensor T (z). As outlined in the opening paragraph of Sect. 3.4.2, we organize our perturbation expansion around the CFT

9

(4); i.e., we take the OPE with the stress-energy tensor (18) of the undeformed theory and account for the deformation S by the perturbative scheme of Sect. 3.4.3.
To get started, we compute the OPE of T (z) as given in Eq. (18) with the integrand of Spert , abbreviated as

O(w, wØ) = STr J(w)M (w, wØ)JØ(wØ)M -1(wØ, w).

(39)

Because operator product expansion is an associative process and T (z) is quadratic in currents, the computation proceeds via the OPE of a current with O(w, wØ). Thus our first step is to expand the operator product J(z) ∑ O(w, wØ). Now since O(w, wØ) does not separate into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic factors, that OPE is not immediately available from the results we have accumulated so far. So, in order to perform the required expansion, which is fundamental to everything we do here and in the sequel, let us take a time-out and review the basic trick [20] behind it.

4.1.1 Tutorial

Consider a left translation M  e-tY M generated by a differentiable field configuration

Y . Use the fact that, by definition, the functional integral measure DM is invariant under

such translations. Let Y denote the differential operator defined by linearization at t = 0,

and observe that the derivation Y obeys the Leibniz product rule. Take Y (z, zØ) to be

holomorphic in the disk D : |z - w| < 1 , smooth in the annulus A : 1 < |z - w| < 2 ,

and identically zero in the exterior, i.e. for |z - w| > 2 . Then, assuming that there are no

extraneous operator insertions in the support of Y , which is the disk |z - w|  2 , derive

the validity of

(Y O)(w, wØ) = O(w, wØ) Y SnWZW

STr Y J(z) dz ∑ O(w, wØ)
D

(42)

holds under the functional integral sign. Finally, expand the holomorphic function Y in

the disk D as

Y (z) = Y (w) + (z - w)Y (w) + . . . ,

(43)

insert this expansion into Eq. (42), and compare the coefficients of Y (w), Y (w), etc., to infer the terms singular as (z - w)-k (k = 1, 2, ...) in the operator product expansion of
J(z) multiplying O(w, wØ). This ends our tutorial review of the basic trick of the trade.
Armed with it, we are in a position to tackle the computation of the OPE at hand.

4.1.2 Renormalization of O(w, wØ)
So far, we have not used any property of O(w, wØ) other than locality. Now, we recall the specific form (39) of O(0) (using invariance under spatial translations to set w = wØ = 0

10

for notational simplicity) and compute the left-hand side of (42) from the expression (8)

for the current J:

(Y O)(0) = -n STr Y (0) M JØM -1 (0).

(44)

Here no term Y (0) (without prime) appears because O is invariant under left translations generated by a constant Y . Thus we infer that the desired OPE is

J (z) O(0)

=

-n z2

M JØM -1 (0) + . . . ,

(45)

where a simple pole z-1 is absent due to the absence of Y (0) on the r.h.s. of (44).

displayed in (45). (We follow the standard convention of using colons to denote the finite

part of an operator product.) Note also that there is no need for point splitting of the two

currents in T (z) since STr : J(z)J(z) : = STr J(z)J(z) by Eq. (16) and STr 1 = 0.

What we have computed so far is the OPE with the first summand in the expression

(18) for T (z). To complete that computation, we need to include the contribution from

the second summand. Simply repeating the steps of before, we obtain

T (z)

∑

O(0)

=

O(0) z2

-

1 n

OA(0) z2

+

...,

(47)

where OA was introduced in Eq. (23). It remains to account for the presence of the deforming factor e-S . Its effect on the
renormalization of O(w, wØ) is seen to be nil, as follows. We compute the OPE with OA :

OA(z,

zØ)

O(0)

=

-

n z2

STrJØ(0)

2-

n zØ2

STrJ(0) 2+ : OA(0)O(0) : + . . . .

(48)

There is no qualitative change when we go to higher powers of OA -- all terms in the OPE are either finite or singular as z-2 or zØ-2. Now those singular terms average to zero by angular dependence when we take the integral d2z OA(z, zØ). Thus we learn that e-S ∑ O(w, wØ) is totally finite. Therefore, the -deformation cannot affect (in first order) the renormalization of Spert =  d2w O(w, wØ).

4.1.3 Discussion

What do we learn from the result above? The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (47) is what characterizes a marginal perturbation d2w O(w, wØ), with total scaling dimension 1 + 1 - 2 = 0. Yet, there is also the second term. Its presence implies that any small but nonzero coupling  inevitably drives RG flow of the parameter  of the fixed-point action (5). Normalization taken into account, we find that the RG flow equation for  is

d d ln a

=

4n 

+ ... ,

(49)

to linear order in the coupling . We observe that the right-hand side of this equation is independent of  and, in particular,  = 1 is not a fixed point of the flow.

11

On the other hand, the fixed-point value  = 1 is not disposable, as it sets the scaling dimension of M to zero, cf. Eq. (19), thereby matching a hallmark of the IQH transition. The conclusion then is that Spert in Eq. (38) is not a viable perturbation for us to add to the fixed-point action (5). We remark in passing that the same result had been reached in [14, 12, 34] from a one-loop calculation of the RG beta function.
This state of affairs begs the question: how can one explain on microscopic grounds that the dangerous coupling  vanishes in the perturbed CFT? Most likely, the answer is that our CFT emerges from a process of non-Abelian bosonization (where we anticipate that the theory is derived by such a step starting from a precursor theory of Dirac-type fields), and that step results in the action functional (5) right at the fixed-point value for the kinetic coupling, i.e. with perturbation parameter  = 0.

4.2 Marginal current-current perturbation

Having learned that the perturbation (38) is ruled out by what we know about the IQH transition, we move on to investigate another possibility in the present subsection. We shall consider a perturbation

Spert

=

1 2n2

d2z ( ∑ OA +  ∑ OI )

(50)

by two current-current interactions:

OA(z, zØ) = STr J(z) STr JØ(zØ), OI (z, zØ) = STr J(z)IJØ(zØ)I-1.

(51)

We notice that OA is still the two-trace Gade-Wegner term, which already appeared above, while the new term OI is a single-trace non-Abelian current-current perturbation that involves some isomorphism I between the spaces of right movers and left movers:

I : CrR|r  CrL|r.

(52)

(There exists no canonical isomorphism of this kind; its appearance needs to be motivated by microscopic reasoning and our scenario [38] of spontaneous symmetry breaking and rank reduction.) Both couplings,  and , are marginal ≠ the explanation for the case of  has already been given in Section 3.4.2; the argument for  is no different.
The goal now is to compute the RG beta functions to cubic order in the couplings  and . In view of that technical challenge, we seek a computational scheme that is maximally efficient. As we already know, a natural idea is to carry out the RG procedure of "coarse graining" via operator product expansion. More precisely, the scheme goes as follows. (We have already been using that scheme implicitly; but now, in view of the serious work ahead, we make it more explicit.) We expand the statistical weight function e-S-Spert in powers of the perturbation Spert of the fixed-point action functional S , then we perform OPE to extract the UV-singular local terms contained in those powers, then we carry out the cutoff-raising scale transformation by using the known OPEs with the stress-energy tensor of the CFT, and finally we re-exponentiate to infer the RG flow of the couplings. That scheme is especially smooth in the present case of marginal perturbations, where the cutoff-raising scale transformation has a trivial effect.
Before we start our investigation of the perturbation (50), let us revisit the question of how to organize the perturbation expansion to accommodate the deformation term in Eq. (5). As we saw in Section 3.4.1, the deformation corrupts the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic conserved currents by the addition of an exact term, which potentially

12

modifies the outcome of operator product expansions involving many factors. For that

reason, we chose to build the perturbation theory around the undeformed fixed-point

action functional of Eq. (4):

S  SnW,Z=W0 .

(53)

Another aspect worth mentioning is this: in Ref. [38] the deformation term was shown to arise as a result of integrating out the Goldstone modes (with diverging stiffness) that restore a spontaneously broken symmetry. By that token, the deformation is to be regarded as a one-loop quantum correction (it is, in fact, of order 1/n relative to the main term). In such a situation it is not clear, at least not immediately, how to sort the terms of a loop (or 1/n) expansion in a consistent manner. This provides us with a second motivation for our approach based on (53). As a final remark let us emphasize, to make sure, that the coupling  in Eq. (50) coincides with the coupling  in Eq. (5).

4.2.1 OI ◊ OI

Here we expand the operator product OI ◊OI for the field OI of the marginal perturbation d2z OI . The main tools will be the OPE (16) for the holomorphic current J, together
with the analogous OPE for JØ, which is of identical form. As before, we use a constant parameter matrix B to do the book keeping of matrix indices. Then

.

(55)

Next we carry out the OPE for JØ(zØ) ∑ JØ(0). Then, upon taking the integral d2z OI (z, zØ), the first term on the r.h.s. will integrate to zero. Also, the leading contribution from the
third term is disconnected, : OI(0)OI(0) : , and hence will cancel (by the linked-cluster principle) when we re-exponentiate. Thus the only term of interest here is the middle one.
Now from Eq. (16) (or, rather, the exact analog thereof for JØ) we derive the formula

STr

AJØ(zØ)BJØ(0)

n zØ2

STrA

∑

STrB

1 zØ

(56)

Applying this expansion (with suitable identifications for A and B) to the middle term on the right-hand side of (55), we arrive at

=

.

.

(59)

Now, before we can write down the ensuing RG flow equation for the coupling , we need to compute another OPE giving a contribution of the same order.

4.2.2 OI ◊ OI ◊ OA In this subsection we compute the OPE for a triple product

d2u OI (u, uØ) ∑ d2v OI (v, vØ) ∑ OA(0) = ?

(60)

Using associativity, we first expand OI (v, vØ) ∑ OA(0); afterwards, we expand the product with OI (u, uØ). In so doing, we need to assume that |u| > |v|, so as to work inside the radius of convergence of the OPE; that can be done without the complication of distinguishing cases, as u and v are on the same footing (both appear as arguments of the field OI ) and we simply exchange u  v when the opposite inequality holds.
Having explained in some detail the technology in use, we now switch to a more concise style of presentation. By using nothing but the various identities given above, we find

OI

(v,

vØ)

∑

OA(0)

=

-

n v2

STrJØ(0)

2

-

n vØ2

STrJ (0)

2+ : OI (0)OA(0) : + . . . .

(61)

The subsequent OPE of OI (u, uØ) with the first two terms on the right-hand side yields coefficient functions (uØv)-2 and (vØu)-2, which average to zero when carrying out the angular integrations in d2u d2v. We therefore concentrate on the OPE of OI (u, uØ) with the third term, : OI (0)OA(0) : . There are two contractions here that give a nonzero final result. In the first one, the J(u) in OI (u, uØ) contracts with the J(0) in OA(0) while the JØ(uØ) in OI (u, uØ) contracts with the JØ(0) in OI (0). The other contraction pattern is obtained by exchanging the roles of J(u) and JØ(uØ). Both contraction pattern make for the
same contribution, which explains the combinatorial factor of 2 in the following result:

OI (u, uØ) : OI (0)OA(0) : = 2

-n u2

(62)

Hence,

(64)

In summary, both operator products OI ◊ OI and OI ◊ OI ◊ OA expand to produce the term OA with coupling . Note also that taking further operator products with OA leads to nothing singular, as the OPE of the Abelian perturbation OA with itself is non-singular. Now, by executing the scheme laid out at the beginning of the section, we can infer the
leading-order RG flow equation for the coupling , as follows.

14

With our calculations so far, we have shown that the Taylor series of e-Spert contains the following UV-singular terms:

to leading order in the couplings  and . We now raise the UV-cutoff of the field theory from a to a + da. In that process, S remains fixed, and so do the marginal perturbations, especially d2z OA . By re-exponentiating and reading off the renormalized action, we conclude that

+ O(3).

(67)

We note that  = 1 is a fixed point of the flow.

4.2.3 OI ◊ OI ◊ OI
As we have seen, the coupling  of the marginal perturbation d2z OI remains marginal (i.e., does not flow) up to quadratic order of the expansion in . That situation changes when we go to cubic order in . Following the same scheme as before, we compute the RG flow of  by expanding the operator product

d2u OI (u, uØ) d2v OI (v, vØ) ∑ OI (0) = ?

(68)

For that, our starting point is the OPE of OI (v, vØ) with OI (0) as given by Eq. (58).

Without loss, we assume that |u| > |v| as before. Owing to the angular integrations

in d2u d2v only the term : OI (0)OI (0) : on the right-hand side of Eq. (58) will give

a nonzero contribution to the OPE (68). Hence we compute OI (u, uØ) : OI (0)OI (0) : .

To obtain a connected term (not canceled by re-exponentiation and the linked-cluster principle) the J(u) and JØ(uØ) in OI (u, uØ) must contract with different factors of the normal-

ordered product : OI (0)OI (0) : . By exchange symmetry, there are two such contraction patterns, giving a combinatorial factor of 2. Each comes with a factor of | - n/u2|2, so we

obtain

OI (u, uØ)

: OI (0)OI (0) :

=

2n2 |u|4

(69)

Again, integrating over u we have |u|>|v| d2u |u|-4 =  |v|-2. It then follows that

=

15

By the standard reasoning explained above, we deduce the result

d d ln a

=

3 3n2

.

(70)

One may ask whether this result could be modified by a contribution of order 3 (where  = 1) due to the quadruple product OI ◊ OI ◊ OI ◊ OA. The answer is no, at least not in the present order 1/n2 of a 1/n expansion. Indeed, one easily verifies by power counting and inspection that one cannot manufacture a (connected) single-trace operator OI (with coefficient of order 1/n2) by the OPE of OI ◊ OI ◊ OI with the two-trace operator OA .

4.2.4 Discussion
Do the RG flow equations we have computed, namely Eq. (70) for  and Eq. (67) for , offer a plausible scenario for stable flow into the CFT (5)? While our expectation was to obtain a stable flow (in the absence of parity-breaking perturbations corresponding to xy - xy), the flow along the real -axis is seen to be unstable! Turning it around, our CFT (5) with  = 0 and  = 1 would be a stable fixed point of Eqs. (70, 67) if the coupling  were imaginary. What should we think of that? Given that the starting point of the Wegner-Efetov formalism is a totally oscillatory field integral, imaginary couplings in the effective action are not entirely unreasonable. However, if  is imaginary, then it cannot be linear in the real quantity xx -xx . Therefore, if our stable flow scenario (with imaginary coupling ) turns out to be correct, the quantitative details of how the conductivity xx flows to its fixed-point value xx = n/2, still remain an open question.
Are there any alternative scenarios? One possibility might be that the stable RG flow can only be understood in an extended field-theory framework, for the following reason. As of this writing, our heuristic picture of how the CFT (5) arises, starts from four Dirac species (see Section 2.2 of Ref. [38]), each of which bosonizes to a level-1 WZW theory. Residual interactions then lock the four independent WZW fields into a single level n = 4 theory, Eq. (5), for the collective field M . It is conceivable that the stable RG flow we are seeking is interwoven with that locking process. Another, more exotic possibility might be that the irrelevant perturbation is non-local.

4.3 Relevant perturbation
The CFT perturbations we have considered up to now preserve the symmetry under "parity", (11), which is a distinctive property of the system at criticality. (Appealing to the analogy with Pruisken's nonlinear sigma model, it is the analog of inverting the topological -angle of that model). Notwithstanding the open questions left by Sections 4.1 and 4.2 above, all such perturbations are expected to be irrelevant. To make a relevant perturbation, one should break the parity symmetry so as to favor, say, clockwise (over counterclockwise) current circulation. We now identify such a perturbation of (5).
For that purpose, we work in the Euclidean plane,  = R2, or some domain   R2, with Cartesian coordinates x, y and complex coordinate function z = x + iy. To motivate the proper idea, we start from the effective action (100) derived in [38] and reviewed below, and we recall that our continuum field theory arises by taking the continuum limit of a network (or other) model with short-distance cutoff. The existence of such a cutoff allows for the possible existence of short-distance singularities in the continuum fields  and  figuring in Eq. (100) of Section 5.0.2. For the compact boson field  :   R/2Z these are of vortex type. For example, the -field for a single vortex centered at the point p with

16

complex coordinate zp would be



=

arg(z

-

zp)

=

1 2i

ln

z- zØ -

zp zØp

.

(71)

By the common origin of  and  from the supermatrix field M -- see Eqs. (94, 99) and note the expression SDet M = e-i -- we expect a vortex at position p in the -field to
be accompanied by a Hodge-dual vortex (d = d) at the same position p in the -field:

 = - ln |z - zp| .

(72)

What might be the physical object corresponding to such a singularity in the underlying microscopic physics? The expression for a SUSY-correlated vortex (71) and (72),

e-i = |z - zp|-1 e-i arg(z-zp) = (z - zp)-1,

(73)

suggests that we see an indication of the onset of pre-localized states away from criticality. Notice, however, that there exist three more singularity types of a similar kind:

(zØ - zØp)-1, z - zp , zØ - zØp .

(74)

The following argument is familiar from the Kosterlitz-Thouless treatment [21, 22] of the two-dimensional xy model. To estimate the statistical significance of such singularities as (73, 74), one compares the cost in energy with the gain in entropy. For the statistical weight function given by the effective action (100), the energy cost of an isolated vortex (in a system with short-distance cutoff aUV and size aIR) is

E

=

n 8

(2

+

2) ln(aIR/aUV),

with the singularities in  and  contributing equally. Since the vortex can be located anywhere in the system with area (aIR/aUV)2, the free energy for an isolated vortex is

f

=

n-4 2

ln(aIR /aUV ),

(75)

which vanishes in our case of n = 4. Thus our - system (100) sits right at the critical point of a phase transition of
Kosterlitz-Thouless type! (In the case of the xy-model, this would be the end point of a line of fixed points.) Then, what kind of perturbation drives the system from criticality into the localized regime? One might expect the answer to be a form of chemical potential that enhances the vortex fugacity. In the xy-model, the enhancement could be brought about by a sine-Gordon type of interaction. However, in our case such terms as STr (M + M -1) or similar are forbidden [38] as additions to the Lagrangian (what's available are but the currents). For another requisite, the perturbation must break parity (11), i.e. the invariance under   Ø and M  M -1, which is the symmetry that distinguishes the critical manifold (xy = xy). Guided by these reasons, we propose the wanted term to be

Sp+ert

=

+ i

 STr M -1ØM.


(76)

To verify that this perturbation does do the job of breaking parity, note that while the

two-form integrand

 STr M -1ØM = Ø STr M M -1

(77)

17

is parity-invariant, a parity transformation reverses the orientation of the integration manifold , thereby reversing the sign of the integral.
To appreciate the consequences of adding such a perturbation, we look at its expression in terms of the variables ,  of the effective action (100) for the r = 1 theory:

Sp+ert

=

+ i





Ø (

-

i)

=

+ 2

d2z (- + i),


(78)

where  = x2 + y2 is the Laplacian of . Now according to the equations of motion for the fields ,  one has  = 0 and  = 0. However, the naive equation  = 0

neglects the possible presence of vortex singularities   ± ln |z - zp|. In fact, with the normalization chosen in (76), Sp+ert counts the (algebraic) number of vortices. Thus, depending on the sign of the coupling +, the perturbation favors vortices of one charge

and disfavors those of the opposite charge. In view of the parity-breaking effect of +, we

propose the identification

+  xy - xy .

(79)

To elucidate the practical consequences of the perturbation (76), we need to renormalize it, taking into account any non-perturbative effects due to the vortex singularities in M . That is a task for the future. Whatever the outcome, it is clear by power counting that the perturbation (76) is marginal, thereby supporting our suggestion that 1/ = 0.

5 Mean conductance

A physical quantity readily accessible through experiments and numerical simulations is the electrical conductance. In numerical work (see e.g. [23]), the standard system geometry to study is that of a cylinder of circumference W and length L, with absorbing boundary conditions imposed at the two boundary circles. To obtain the (dissipative) conductance, one takes the trace of the square of an end-to-end Green's function or, assuming the Landauer-Bu®ttiker formula, of the transmission matrix. In the presence of disorder, the conductance is a random variable with a distribution that widens with increasing L.
If we were able to perform an accurate field-theory calculation of the moments of the conductance on and off criticality, we would have a direct handle on our field-theory parameters and, in particular, we could read off the renormalization-group beta functions. Alas, that goal is too ambitious for now. What we can handle at present is the mean conductance, G, for a cylinder geometry in the scaling limit L   (holding W/L fixed), at the critical point of the IQH transition. In fact, we shall derive the formula

G = 1

e-l2

=

(-1)me-2m2/ ,

lZ+1/2

2L nW

,

(80)

valid (in the scaling limit of the critical system with ideal contacts) for any aspect ratio L/W . Note that the two expressions for the fixed-point conductance G imply one another
by Poisson summation. By specializing to the Ohmic regime   1 and matching to Ohm's law G = xxW/L, one infers the value

xx

=

n 2

=

2 



0.6367

(n = 4)

(81)

for the fixed-point conductivity. We also note that the corrections (to Ohmic behavior)

for the square geometry,

GL=W

2 

(1

-

2 e-2

+ . . .),

(82)

18

are too small to account for the lower value (GL=W = 0.57 ± 0.02) found in Ref. [23]. To start the derivation of Eq. (80), we take the cylinder coordinates to be x  [0, L]

and y  R/(W Z). Thus the boundary circles are at x = 0 and x = L. Now according to

Kubo linear-response theory, a conductance is a current-current correlation function. If

j denotes the longitudinal (or x-) component of the current density operator (of a micro-

scopic model in second quantization), our conductance G is a ground-state expectation

value

G=

dy j (x, y) ∑ dy j (x, y) .

The two integrals are over any two cycles of constant longitudinal position. (By current conservation, the expression for G is independent of the cycle positions x, x as long as 0 < x < x < L. The cycles may also be deformed within their homology classes.)

Assuming a free-fermion ground state to arrive a reduced expression (a.k.a. the KuboGreenwood formula) in first quantization, one replaces the expectation j (x, y)j (x, y)

by a product of retarded and advanced Green's functions,

which are evaluated at the Fermi energy and decorated with derivatives ( acting on one and - acting on the other factor; cf. (35)) to form the longitudinal current.
What is our field-theory expression for the Kubo conductance (83) averaged over the disorder? The answer (still using the symbol G, but now for the average conductance) is

(84)

where . . . means the expectation value w.r.t. the functional integral with action (5). We will now discuss the field-theory current J and overall factor 1/2 in sequence.
While a first-principles derivation of the current J looks like a daunting task, we are assisted by the circumstance that J is essentially determined by symmetry. In fact, our current J corresponds to the conserved current of the underlying stationary disordered electron state at criticality, and as such it must be obtained as the linear response of the action functional (5) w.r.t. axial transformations M  eXL M e-XR with -XL = XR  X :

S[e-X M e-X ] = S[M ] - i STr J  dX + O(X2),

(85)

which are symmetries in the case of constant X. Such transformations leave the func-

tional integration measure unchanged for any space-dependent X. Therefore, one has the

equation of motion

dJ = 0

(86)

(as a Ward identity, valid under the functional integral sign and away from any operator insertions). From the definition (85) one obtains the conserved current J as

J

=

JL + JR 2

,

(87)

where JL, JR are given by the expressions (21, 22) for the CFT (5). What appears in Eq. (84) are the off-diagonal (even-odd and odd-even) components of J ; upon specializing to
r = 1 we can label "even" and "odd" simply by 0 and 1.
Let us now explain the origin of the factor of 1/2 in Eq. (84). (Without that factor, we would arrive at Ohm's law with an incorrect conductivity xx = n/.) The current J

arises by bosonization of expressions that are quadratic in the bosonic and fermionic basic fields (bret  b+, fadv  f-, etc.) of the SUSY formalism:

The definitions of the linearly transformed fields B±, C±, F±, G± are not reproduced here (for those, and for the raison d'etre of the phase factors ei0 and ei1, please be referred

rank reduction, gl(2r|2r)  gl(r|r), and the factor of 1/2 in Eq. (84) compensates for it.

5.0.1 Perturbative calculation

Working with the r = 1 theory, we now calculate the conductance G in leading order of
a loop (or 1/n) expansion, at the RG-fixed point (5) and for the cylinder geometry with
absorbing boundary conditions at x = 0 and x = L. First of all, we fix some constant isomorphism I : C1L|1  C1R|1 as a reference map. Then, parameterizing the field as M = eXL/2I e-XR/2 with X = XL = -XR , we have the tree-level action

Stree

(89)

with d2z = |dx  dy| and the Euclidean Laplace operator  = x2 + y2 . The quadratic

contribution from the -deformation term has been omitted from Stree , as it does not

The inverse of the Laplacian (for 0  x < x  L) has the expression

sinh(kx) sinh(k(L - x)) kW sinh(kL)

,

(92)

k2Z/W

where the summand for k = 0 is to be understood by the l'Hospital rule. To check that this is the correct free-field Green's function to use, notice that it vanishes at the boundaries (x = 0 and x = L) and behaves near the diagonal as -1(r, r) = (2)-1 ln |r - r|.
Only the k = 0 term in the sum of Eq. (92) survives the integration over transverse cycles in Eq. (91). Thus we obtain the simple result

which has the form of Ohm's law with fixed-point conductivity xx = n/2. Away from the RG-fixed point, there are certainly corrections to the tree-level result (93). Nonetheless,
right at the fixed point the result (93) holds exactly, by the following line of reasoning.

20

5.0.2 Exact calculation

For the calculation of the first moment of the conductance distribution (as opposed to higher moments or cumulants thereof) it suffices to consider r = 1, as before. Taking advantage of the technical simplicity afforded by small matrix dimension, we parameterize the 2 ◊ 2 supermatrix field M as

M=

M

1 0

M

0 1

M

1 1

=

1 

0 1

e 0 0 ei

.

(94)

What makes this parametrization especially useful is that the fixed-point action functional (5) has a quadratic dependence on the fermionic fields  and . Yet, there is still the complication that  and  appear in the current operators J of the correlation function (84). Hence, to do the Gaussian integral over these fields, it is convenient to re-express the product of current operators as

(J

)01(J

)10

-

1 2

(J

)00(J

)00

+

(J

)11(J

)11 .

(95)

(The re-expressed correlation function is identical to the previous one by the target-space supersymmetry of the formalism). Another useful trick is to push the cycles x = const and x = const all the way to the boundaries of system (x  0 and x  L) by invoking current conservation. The current-current correlation function then becomes (a second derivative of) the partition-function integral with twisted boundary conditions. By the replacement (95) the twisting is

(x = 0, y) = 0  (0, y) = 2, (x = L, y) = 0  (L, y) = 2

(96)

for the first term on the r.h.s. of (95), and similar for the second term (with  replaced by ). In the next paragraph, we describe that trick in more detail.
Focusing on the first term on the right-hand side of (95), consider the discontinuous 00-generator field X, defined by

X, = ( <x + >x )

1 0

0 0

,

(97)

where <x and >x are the characteristic functions for the two collar regions delineated on the cylinder by the two cycles of constant x and x in Eq. (84). Then the functional

integral e-S with

S = SnW,ZW[eX, M eX, ]

(98)

generates our current-current correlator by Taylor expansion as the coefficient of the product  , by virtue of (85) and the jump of the characteristic functions. Next, we do the
step of pushing the current integration cycles to the boundaries x = 0 and x = L. In the final step, we absorb the left and right factors eX, in Eq. (98) into the integration

variable M , thereby twisting the boundary conditions as in (96).

By all these manipulations, the integral over the fermionic fields  and  becomes a

straight Gaussian integral, giving a log-determinant correction [38]

- ln Det - e-/2 z e zØ e-/2 ,    - i ,

(99)

to the effective action functional. Luckily, that log-determinant can be computed exactly. Its effect is to cancel the -deformation term and add instead a term ( - i)RQ with "background charge" Q = -1 to the Lagrangian:

The 2-form R is the curvature of the Riemann surface . In the case at hand (of a cylinder  with flat-space geometry), R is localized at the two system boundaries: one may imagine that the boundary conditions (96) compactify the cylinder to a two-sphere with singular curvature at the two points (x = 0 and x = L) of compactification.
It remains to work out the partition functions for the Gaussian free field  and the compact boson , for our cylinder with twisted boundary conditions (96). This computation can be done by the transfer matrix technique (or radial quantization). The result is in (80), where we note that the sum over integers l  Z + 1/2 accounts for the periodicity    + 2, and the shift by 1/2 is caused by the background charges at x = 0, L.
6 Outlook
Past numerical work on the integer quantum Hall transition failed to reach conclusive agreement on the numerical values of the critical exponent  for the localization length and the leading irrelevant exponent y. Our prediction [38] from the conformal field theory (CFT) describing the scaling limit of the transition was that, strictly speaking, -1 = 0 = y, as the CFT admits nothing but current-current perturbations that are marginal. We proposed that the numerics sees transients due to terms in the renormalization-group (RG) beta functions which are nonlinear in the couplings of these marginal perturbations. In the present article, we investigated that proposal in detail. We found that one natural candidate for the marginally irrelevant perturbation can be ruled out on phenomenological grounds. The remaining candidate has the unorthodox feature that its coupling must be imaginary in order for the RG flow to be attracted to the CFT. In view of this inconclusive situation, there is now a strong need for a complete derivation of the CFT starting from a disordered electron model such as the network model of Chalker & Coddington [5].
Turning to the bigger picture, a major challenge to our theoretical scenario is posed by a variant of the Chalker-Coddington network model, namely the model with two channels per link and SU(2) disorder (a.k.a. class C, or "spin" quantum Hall effect). We believe that the RG-fixed point field theory of that model, some properties of which are known exactly, is a CFT very similar to the one reviewed here. The same phenomena of spontaneous symmetry breaking and rank reduction are expected to take place there.
