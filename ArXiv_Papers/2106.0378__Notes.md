## Abstract

Working in the framework of generalized statistics, the problem of availability of the third law of thermodynamics in the black hole physics is studied by focusing on Schwarzschild black hole which easily and clearly exposes the violation of this law in common the approach based on Bekenstein entropy. Additionally, it is addressed that some inconsistencies between the predictions of quantum field theory and those of thermodynamics on the black hole temperature may be reconciled by using the thermodynamics laws in order to broaden energy definition. It claims that thermodynamics should be employed as a powerful tool in looking for more comprehensive energy definitions in high energy physics, still mysterious.
