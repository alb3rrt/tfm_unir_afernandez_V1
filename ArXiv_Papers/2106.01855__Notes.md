## Abstract

This contribution studies a specific deformation of algebras with anti-involution. Starting with the observation that twisting the multiplication of such an algebra by its anti-involution generates a Hom-associative algebra of type II, it formulates the adequate modules theory over these algebras, and shows that there is a faithful functor from the category of finite-dimensional left modules of algebras with involution to finite-dimensional right modules of Hom-associative algebras of type II. It ends with a discussion on a diagrammatic operadic approach to generalize the study of such deformations.
