## Abstract

We study interpolating sequences of $d$-tuples of matrices, by looking at the commuting and the non-commuting case separately. In both cases, we will give a characterization of such sequences in terms of separation conditions on suitable reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and we will give sufficient conditions stated in terms of separation via analytic functions. Examples of such interpolating sequences will also be given
