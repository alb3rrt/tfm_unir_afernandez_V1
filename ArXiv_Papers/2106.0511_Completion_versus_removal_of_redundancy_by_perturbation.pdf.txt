Completion versus removal of redundancy by perturbation

Abstract

A sequence erty if each f

f=

ck gk

for some scalar coefficients ck. In this paper we analyze the question

whether there exist small norm-perturbations of {gk} k=1 which allow

to represent all f  H; the answer turns out to be yes for frame se-

quences and Riesz sequences, but no for general basic sequences. The

insight gained from the analysis is used to address a somewhat dual

question, namely, whether it is possible to remove redundancy from a

sequence with the expansion property via small norm-perturbations;
we prove that the answer is yes for frames {gk} k=1 such that gk  0 as k  , as well as for frames with finite excess. This particular

question is motivated by recent progress in dynamical sampling.

1 Introduction

Let H denote a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and suppose

that each

a f

given sequence  span {gk} k=1

{gk has

} k=1 in H has the a representation

property,

i.e.,

that


f = ckgk

for certain coefficients ck  C. Our goal is to address the following question:

when and how can we perform small norm-perturbations on the sequence

{gk} k=1 and f  H have

hereby obtain an expansion f

a sequence

=

 k=1

ck

{k} k=1 such k for certain

that arbitrary coefficients ck

elements  C?

Formulated as above, the question is clearly a completion problem. We

will show that the completion problem has an affirmative answer for the

so-called Riesz sequences and frame sequences, but not for general basic

sequences; along the way we also consider a number of other completion

problems. Interestingly, the insight gained from the above analysis can be

used to address a somewhat dual question: when and how can a redundant system {gk} k=1 be turned into a complete but nonredundant system {k} k=1 by small norm-perturbations? We will provide a positive answer to this

question for a number of frames, in particular, for the so-called near-Riesz

bases introduced by Holub in [13]. Additional motivation for this particular

question will be provided at the end of the paper.

The paper is organized as follows. In the rest of the introduction we set

the stage by providing a number of definitions and results from the literature.

In Section 2 we present the results about the completion problem; the dual

problem concerning removal of redundancy is considered in Section 3. A sequence {gk} k=1 in the Hilbert space H is called a frame for H if there
exist constants A, B > 0 such that


A ||f ||2  | f, gk |2  B ||f ||2, f  H;
k=1

(1.2)

suitable numbers A, B are called lower, resp. upper frame bounds. The sequence {gk} k=1 is called a Bessel sequence if at least the right-hand inequality in (1.2) holds. A frame which is at the same time a basis, is called a Riesz
basis. Note that several other characterizations of frames and Riesz bases exist, e.g., in terms of operator theory. For example, if {ek} k=1 is a given orthonormal basis for H, frames for H are precisely the sequences {V ek} k=1 where V : H  H is a bounded surjective operator; Riesz bases correspond
precisely to the case where the operator V also is injective. Finally, a sequence {gk} k=1 which is a frame for the (sub)space K := span {gk} k=1 , is called a frame sequence; Riesz sequences are defined in the analogue way.
One of the key reasons for the interest in frames is that a frame has the expansion property: in fact, given any frame {gk} k=1 , there exists a so-called

f = f, fk gk, f  H.

about their history and applications.

The following Lemma collects a number of well-known results concerning

norm-perturbations of various sequences with the expansion property.

Lemma 1.1 Consider two sequences {gk} k=1 , {hk} k=1 in H, satisfying that

||gk - hk||2 < A,
k=1

for a value of A as specified below. Then the following holds: (i) [7] If {gk} k=1 is a frame for H with lower bound A, then {hk} k=1 is a frame for H.

(ii)

[8] If Riesz

{gk} k=1 is a Riesz sequence with lower sequence; furthermore, codim(span {gk

}b ko=u1n)d=Ac,otdhiemn({sphakn}{ k=h1k

is a } k=1).

Alternative norm-perturbation conditions are formulated in [6]; however, they need that we have access to information about a dual frame, which is not the case in the current paper. Note also that a number of classical results about norm-perturbation (typically for orthonormal sequences) are collected in [17]. Observe that more general perturbation results are available in the literature, typically formulated in terms of certain operators rather than norm-perturbations; see, e.g., [9] and the references therein.

2 Completion via norm-perturbation
Our main interest is to consider the completion problem for sequences {gk} k=1 having the expansion property. However, we first state a number of other completion properties, some of which will be needed in later proofs. Given

3

any sequence {gk} k=1 in H, we define its excess E ({gk} k=1) as the maximal number of elements that can be removed without changing the spanned space, i.e.,

E ({gk} k=1) := max {J  N span{gk}kN\J = span {gk} k=1}.

(2.1)

Proposition 2.1 Let {gk} k=1 be a sequence in H. Then the following hold:

(i) If {gk} k=1 is not norm-bounded below, there exists a complete sequence {k} k=1 such that

||gk - k||  0 as k  ;

(2.2)

(ii) If E ({gk} k=1)  codim(span {gk} k=1), there exists a complete sequence {k} k=1 such that (2.2) holds.

(iii) If {gk} k=1 is convergent, there exists a complete sequence {k} k=1 such

that (2.2) {gk} k=1 .

holds;

in

particular,

{k } k=1

converges

to

the

same

limit

as

In all the stated cases, given any  > 0, the sequence {k} k=1 can be chosen such that ||gk - k||   for all k  N.
Proof. For the proof of (i), given  > 0, choose a frame {fk} k=1 for H such that ||fk||   for all k  N and ||fk||  0 as k  ; for example, letting {ek} k=1 denote any orthonormal basis, we can take

{fk} k=1

Using Lemma 1.1(i), this implies that {fn+gkn} n=1 is a frame for H and hence complete. Thus, the sequence {k} k=1 formed from {gk} k=1 by replacing the elements {gkn} n=1 by {fn + gkn} n=1 will satisfy the requirements.

For the proof of (ii) we first assume additionally that M := codim(span {gk} k=1)

is finite. Without loss of generality and only for notational convenience, as-

sume that the sequence {gk} k=1 is and take an orthonormal basis {ek

satisfies the requirements. The case where E ({gk} k=1) = codim(span {gk} k=1) =  is similar and only requires minor notational modifications.
For the proof of (iii), assume that the sequence {gk} k=1 converges to f  H. Given  > 0, choose K  N such that ||f - gk||  /2 for k  K. Let
{ek} k=1 denote an orthonormal basis for H and define {k} k=1 by

 gk,  k := f,

f

+

ek-K ,

if k = 1, . . . , K - 1; if k = K; if k > K.

Then span{ek} k=1  span{k} k=1, so span{k} k=1 is clearly complete. Furthermore, for k  K,

||gk - k||  ||gk - f || + ||f - k||  ,

and ||gk - k||  0 as k  .

We are now ready to consider the completion problem for Riesz sequences and frame sequences. The proofs rely on an interesting result proved recently by V. Olevskii:

Lemma 2.2 [16, 15] If {ek} k=1 is an orthonormal sequence in H, there exists an orthonormal basis {k} k=1 for H such that
||ek - k||  0 as k  .
In addition, given any  > 0, the sequence {k} k=1 can be chosen such that ||ek - k||   for all k  N.

5

Theorem 2.3 Let {gk} k=1 be a sequence in H. Then the following hold: (i) If {gk} k=1 is a Riesz sequence, there exists a Riesz basis {k} k=1 for H such that

||gk - k||  0 as k  .

(2.3)

(ii) If {gk} k=1 is a frame sequence, there exists a frame {k} k=1 for H such that (2.3) holds.

(iii) If {gk} k=1 is a Bessel sequence, there exists a complete Bessel sequence {k} k=1 such that (2.3) holds.

In all the stated cases, given any  > 0, the sequence {k} k=1 can be chosen such that ||gk - k||   for all k  N.

Proof. H, and

We let K

first :=

prove (iii). span {gk} k=1

Thus, let {gk} k=1 be ; we can assume that

a Bessel sequence K = {0}. Also,

in if

K is finite-dimensional, the results follow from Proposition 2.1 (ii), so we

will assume that K is infinite-dimensional. Now, by the standard properties

of a Bessel sequence [9], choose an orthonormal basis {ek} k=1 for K and a bounded operator U : K  K such that gk = Uek, k  N. Associated with the orthonormal sequence {ek} k=1, choose the orthonormal basis {k} k=1 for H as in Lemma 2.2, and define a bounded operator V : H  H by

V = U on K, V = I on K.

(2.4)

Since the range of the operator U contains the vectors {gk} k=1 , it is dense in K. Thus, the range of the operator V is dense in H; this implies that the sequence {k} k=1 := {V k} k=1 is complete in H. A direct calculation reveals that {k} k=1 is a Bessel sequence. Furthermore, for all k  N,

||gk - k|| = ||U ek - V k|| = ||V ek - V k||  ||V || ||ek - k||.

Since the operator V only depends on the sequence {gk} k=1 (and the fixed

choice of Indeed, if

{{gekk}} k k==11)i,s

this proves (iii). a frame sequence,

This also gives the range of the

the proof operator U

of (i)-(ii). equals K,

which implies that the range of the operator V equals H, and hence {k} k=1

is a frame for H; and if {fk} k=1 is a Riesz sequence, the operator U : K  K

is bijective, implying that V : H  H is bijective, and hence that {k} k=1

is a Riesz sequence.

Remark 2.4 Despite the fact that  > 0 can be chosen arbitrarily small

in Theorem 2.3, there can be to the sequence

is a restriction on how "close" {gk} k=1. Indeed, if {gk} k=1 is a

the sequence {k} k=1 (non-complete) Riesz

sequence with lower bound A, then the sequence {k} k=1 in Theorem 2.3(i)

must satisfy that


||gk - k||2  A;
k=1

(2.5)

otherwise Lemma 1.1(ii) would imply that {k} k=1 is non-complete as well. A similar result holds for frame sequences, although the lower bound on the
infinite sum in (2.5) will involve the gap between two particular subspaces of
H; see [8, 10] for more detailed information.

Theorem 2.3 makes it natural to ask whether a basic sequence (i.e., a Schauder basis for a subspace) also can be extended to a Schauder basis for H by small norm-perturbations of the elements. The following example shows that the answer is no in general, unless additional assumptions are added.

Example 2.5 Let {ek} k=1 denote an orthonormal basis for H and consider the sequence

{gk} k=1 = {2e2, 4e4, 6e6, . . . } = {2ke2k} k=1.

Clearly {gk} k=1

is a

basic

sequence.

Since {e2k} k=1 forms a Riesz sequence with lower bound A = 1, Lemma 1.1(ii) implies that {(2k)-1k} k=1 also forms a Riesz sequence, spanning a space of the same codimension as {e2k} k=1; in particular, {k} k=1 can not be complete in H, and hence is not a Schauder basis for H.

3 Removal of redundancy via norm-perturbations

In this section the focus is on sequences {gk} k=1 having the expansion prop-

erty on the entire underlying Hilbert space H. Such expansions might be

redundant, i.e., a given f  H might have expansions f =

 k=1

via small norm-perturbations of the vectors gk.

Our first observation, stated next, does not even need the frame assump-

tion or any other expansion property.

Theorem 3.1 Consider any sequence {gk} k=1 in H such that gk  0 as k  . Then, given any  > 0, there exists a Riesz basis {k} k=1 for H such that

||gk - k||  , k  N.

Proof. First, given any  > 0, choose K  N such that ||gk|| < /2 for

k  K. We will now construct {k} k=1 recursively, of the form k := gk + k

with the vectors k chosen as described next. First, take 1  H such that

||1||   and 1 = 0. Then choose 2  H such that ||2||   and {1, 2}

is linearly independent. Continuing recursively, we finally choose K  H

such that ||K||   and {1, 2, . . . , K} is linearly independent. Then

{1, 2, . . . , K} is a Riesz basis for the subspace V := span{1, 2, . . . , K}.

Now choose an orthonormal basis {ek} k=1 for V  and define k for k > K

by

k

:=

 2

ek

.

Then

{k} k=1

is

a

Riesz

basis

for

H

and

||gk

- k||





for

all

k  N.

The result in Theorem 3.1 immediately applies to a number of well-known frames in the literature:

Example 3.2 We state a number of examples of frames {gk} k=1 such that gk  0 as k   :

(i) Given any orthonormal basis {ek} k=1 for H, the family

{gk } k=1

:=

{e1,

}

is a frame for H. Clearly gk  0 as k  . Note that this particular frame was used in the proof of Proposition 2.1.

8

(ii) Let again {ek} k=1 be an orthonormal basis for H and fix any  ]0, 1[. Let  := 1 - - for   N, and define the vectors


gk := k
=1

1 - 2 e, k  N.

Then {gk} k=1 is a frame (the so-called Carleson frame), a result proved

by Aldroubi et al. in [1, 2]. It is easy to see that gk  0 as k  . Note

that for any N  N, frame as well. From be approximated by

a Riesz basis, as stated in Theorem 3.1.

(iii) More generally than (ii), it was proved in [12] that any redundant frame that can be represented as an operator orbit {gk} k=1 = {T k} k=1 for a bounded operator T : H  H and some   H will have the property that gk  0 as k  .

In order to reach the next result we need the following Lemma. Recall

that the deficit of a sequence vector space span {gk} k=1 .

{gk} k=1

defined

of

the

Lemma 3.3 Let {ek} k=1 be an orthonormal basis for H. Given any  > 0 and any N  N, there exists an orthonormal system {k} k=1 with deficit N such that ||ek - k||   for all k  N.
Proof. Take any orthonormal system {k} k=1 with deficit N, and choose via Lemma 2.2 an orthonormal basis {k} k=1 for H such that ||k - k||   for all k  N. Then, choose the unitary operator U : H  H such that ek = U k, and let k := U k, k  N. Then {k} k=1 is an orthonormal system with deficit N, and ||ek - k|| = ||U k - U k|| = ||k - k||   for all k  N, as desired.

Theorem 3.4 Consider a frame of the form {gk} k=1 = {gk}Nk=1 {gk} k=N+1, where N  N and {gk} k=N+1 is a Riesz basis for H. Then, given any  > 0, there exists a Riesz basis {k} k=1 such that ||gk - k||   for all k  N.

9

Proof. First, consider an orthonormal basis for H indexed as {ek} k=N+1 and choose the bounded bijective operator V : H  H such that gk = V ek for k = N +1, N +2, . . . . Using Lemma 3.3, choose an orthonormal system {k} k=N+1 with deficit N such that ||ek - k||  /||V || for k = N + 1, N + 2, . . . . Then, letting k := V k, k = N + 1, N + 2, . . . , the family {k} k=N+1 is a Riesz sequence with deficit N, and ||gk - k|| = ||V ek - V k||   for k = N + 1, N + 2, . . . .
Now, consider the vector gN . If gN / span{k} k=N+1, let N := gN ; then {k} k=N is a Riesz sequence with deficit N - 1. On the other hand, if gN  span{k} k=N+1, choose any normalized vector N / span{k} k=N+1, and let N := gN + N ; then again {k} k=N is a Riesz sequence with deficit N - 1, and ||gk - k||   for k = N, N + 1, N + 2, . . . . Applying now the same procedure on gN-1, gN-2, . . . , g1, we arrive at the desired Riesz basis {k} k=1 in a finite number of steps.
Interestingly, frames of the type considered in Theorem 3.4 were called
near-Riesz bases by Holub in the paper [13]; the above result provides an
additional reason for this name being very appropriate.

Remark 3.5 Despite the fact that  > 0 can be chosen arbitrarily small in

Theorem 3.4, the Riesz basis
where A is the lower frame show that {k} k=1 would be

A, [5]

We want to point out that the proof of Theorem 3.4 somewhat hides the fact that it is highly nontrivial to get direct access to the Riesz basis {k} k=1, especially due to the intriguing and deep construction by V. Olevskii playing
a key role in the argument. The next example illustrates this by a concrete
construction.

Example 3.6 Let again {ek} k=1 be an orthonormal basis for H and consider the frame

{gk} k=1 := {e1, e1, e2, e3, e4, . . . },

consisting of the orthonormal basis and a single extra element. A natural

way to try to remove the redundancy would be to fix a small  > 0 and let

Considering {k} k=1 as a perturbation of this Riesz basis, it now follows from

the results in [5] that {k} k=1 is a Riesz basis for H. Note that

||gk - k|| =

however, this construction does not allow us to obtain ||gk - k||   when  < 2-1/2  0.7. In fact, in order to obtain the result in Theorem 3.4 for
smaller values of , it would be necessary to consider much more complicated perturbations {k} k=1 of {gk} k=1 , making it highly nontrivial to do this in practice.

Remark 3.7 The question of removal of redundancy is partly motivated by the research topic dynamical sampling, introduced in the papers [3, 1]. One of the key issues in dynamical sampling is the construction of frames as orbits {T k} k=0 of a bounded operator T : H  H, for some   H; we encountered such frames already in Example 3.2(ii) & (iii). Unfortunately it is very difficult to construct such frames, and the only concrete examples available in the literature are indeed Riesz bases [11] and the Carleson frame [1] considered in Example 3.2 (ii). Also, it was proved in [11] that a nearRiesz basis never has this property. This raises the natural question whether a near-Riesz basis can be approximated by a Riesz basis, and hence by an orbit of a bounded operator; Theorem 3.4 confirms that this indeed is possible. We will phrase this consequence of Theorem 3.4 as a separate result, where we index the given near-Riesz basis by {gk} k=0 for notational convenience:
Corollary 3.8 Consider any near-Riesz basis {gk} k=0. Then, given any  > 0, there exists   H and a bounded operator T : H  H such that
||gk - T k||  , k  N0.

11

The results in Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.4 do not cover the standard (regular) redundant Gabor frames and wavelet frames: they consist of vectors with equal norm, and they have infinite excess [4]. Due to the complications discussed in Example 3.1 and the preceding text it seems to be very difficult to answer the question whether all frames indeed can be approximated by a Riesz basis. At least for Gabor frames and wavelet frames we can apply the following adaption of the Feichtinger Theorem (finally proved in one of its equivalent formulations in [14]), showing that any frame which is normbounded below can be approximated by a finite collection of Riesz bases:

Theorem 3.9 Let {gk} k=1 be a frame which is norm-bounded below. Then

there exists a finite partition {gk} k=1 =

J j=1

{gk

}kIj

with

the

property

that

for each  > 0 there exist Riesz bases {k}kIj , j = 1, . . . , J, for H such that

||gk - k||   for all k  N.

Proof. Choose according to the Feichtinger Theorem a finite partition

{gk} k=1 =

J j=1

{gk

}kIj

such

that

each

sequence

{gk}kIj , j

=

1, . . . , J

is

a

Riesz sequence; using Theorem 2.1 in [11] we can shuffle the elements around

to ensure that each of the index sets Ij is infinite. Now the result follows

directly from Theorem 2.3(i).

The result in Theorem 3.9 can be formulated as a operator-theoretic result, similarly to Corollary 3.8; we leave the precise formulation to the interested reader.
