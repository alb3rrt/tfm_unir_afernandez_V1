QUASI-INVARIANCE FOR INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL KOLMOGOROV DIFFUSIONS
FABRICE BAUDOIN, MARIA GORDINA, AND TAI MELCHER
Abstract. We prove Cameron-Martin type quasi-invariance results for the heat kernel measure of infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov and related diffusions. We first study quantitative functional inequalities for appropriate finite-dimensional approximations of these diffusions, and we prove these inequalities hold with dimension-independent coefficients. Applying an approach developed in [5, 10, 11], these uniform bounds may then be used to prove that the heat kernel measure for certain of these infinite-dimensional diffusions is quasi-invariant under changes of the initial state.

1. Introduction
Smoothness properties are of classical interest in the study of measures in infinite dimensions. These properties have been a particular focus for measures associated to diffusions, either the measure induced on the path space or the end point distribution (that is, the heat kernel measure) for diffusions taking values in an infinite-dimensional space. In finite dimensions, hypoellipticity of the generator is a standard hypothesis to assume for

(or is in some sense equivalent to) regularity properties of the heat kernel

measure. It is natural to consider analogues of various hypoelliptic con-

structions in infinite dimensions, keeping in mind that even the definition of

hypoellipticity is not easily available in such a setting.

Even in the finite-dimensional setting, despite having an explicit Gaussian heat kernel, it is challenging to derive typical functional inequalities for the associated semigroup.
In the present paper, we consider a natural infinite-dimensional analogue of the Kolmogorov diffusion as well as a variation of that construction. Note that in the infinite-dimensional setting we can not rely on standard definitions of hypoellipticity. In particular, the heat kernel measure is not a measure with a density with respect to Lebesgue measure anymore. Still we can prove quasi-invariance results to reflect regularity of the heat kernel measure. More specifically, let (W, H, µ) be an abstract Wiener space, and {Bt}t 0 be a Brownian motion on W with covariance structure determined by
E [ Bs, h H Bt, k H ] = h, k H min(s, t), for all s, t 0 and h, k  W   H. For more details on the setting we refer to Section 3. We define an infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov diffusion as the W × W -valued process given by

For x  W × W , let Xtx denote a Kolmogorov diffusion started at x, and let tx denote its distribution, with t0 =: t. We will prove that for t > 0 the measure tx is equivalent to t when x  H × H. That is, for x = (h, k) we have
Xth,k = Xt + (h, k + th) ,
and we will show that t(h,k) = Law(Xt(h,k)) is mutually absolutely continuous with t when (h, k)  H × H. We will also give bounds on the Lp norms of the associated Radon-Nikodym derivatives. We then consider an analogous

non-Gaussian process

(1.1)

t

for functions F taking values in finite- or infinite-dimensional spaces, and we

prove similar results in this case under the assumption of certain derivative bounds for F .

Before further describing the structure of the paper and the main results, let us mention several papers most relevant to the techniques we are us-

ing. In [4] the first two authors and Ph. Mariano study gradient bounds

and other related functional inequalities for Kolmogorov-type diffusions in

finite dimensions via both the generalized -calculus techniques employed

in the present paper as well as through coupling methods. The method we

follow for proving quasi-invariance for measures in infinite dimensions via

functional inequalities was developed in [5, 10, 11]. This approach relies on

certain inequalities holding with dimension-independent coefficients on ap-

propriate finite-dimensional approximations. These methods were success-

fully applied to infinite-dimensional Heisenberg groups in [9] in the elliptic

case and [5] in the hypoelliptic case. A different proof for the hypoelliptic

Heisenberg setting was given in [8]; in that paper, it was in fact proved that the hypoelliptic heat kernel measure satisfied stronger smoothness criteria.

The paper [2] gives another example of using geometric methods to prove quasi-invariance for path spaces over totally geodesic Riemannian foliations

equipped with a sub-Riemannian structure.

Like a diffusion in the Heisenberg group, the Kolmogorov diffusion stands

as one of the simplest examples of a hypoelliptic diffusion. Still, given the

obstacles which are often unique to each construction of infinite-dimensional

diffusions, the proof of dimension-independent estimates typically requires

ad hoc methods. In particular, the Kolmogorov diffusion provides an ex-

ample of an operator satisfying a weak H¨ormander's condition, where the

drift is required to generate the full span of the tangent space. This means

that techniques recently developed to study diffusions in sub-Riemannian manifolds are not directly applicable. Also, in the case of the generalized

Kolmogorov diffusions we consider, there is no underlying group structure and so a shift in the initial state of the process does not correspond to any

group action. Thus the results in the current paper can not be proven by directly applying the approach developed in [10, 11].

BAUDOIN, GORDINA, AND MELCHER

It is additionally worth noting that in this paper we consider a nonGaussian generalization of the Kolmogorov diffusion, to demonstrate the application of the method to a non-Gaussian diffusion. Thus, the method of proof we use is robust and not restricted to Gaussian situations.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we establish the necessary functional inequalities in the finite-dimensional settings. In Section 3, we construct the processes in infinite dimensions and use results proved in Section 2 to demonstrate the existence of a Radon-Nikodym derivative for the "shifted" heat kernel measure with respect to the heat kernel measure started at 0. Theorem 3.3 proves quasi-invariance for the "standard" infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov diffusion. Remark 3.4 shows how one can prove the quasi-invariance result in this case as an application of the standard Cameron-Martin-Maruyama theorem on path space. Theorem 3.8 gives conditions under which quasi-invariance holds for generalized Kolmogorov diffusions of the form (1.1) where F takes values in a finite-dimensional vector space. Theorem 3.15 treats the case where F takes values in W . Example 3.16 gives some examples of where Theorem 3.15 may be applied, and revisits the standard case, showing that one may actually get a better upper bound on the Radon-Nikodym derivative than the estimate proved in Theorem 3.3.

2. Wang's Harnack inequality for finite-dimensional diffusions
We first establish the necessary functional inequalities for diffusions taking values in finite dimensions. We initially treat the case of the standard Kolmogorov diffusion before considering a non-Gaussian generalization of this construction.

The fact that reverse log Sobolev inequalities imply the Wang-type Harnack inequalities for general Markov operators is by now well-known (see for example [1, Proposition 3.4] and in the infinite-dimensional context [5, Propositions 2.10 and 4.9]). We deduce then the following statement.

Theorem 2.2 (Wang-type Harnack inequality). Suppose f be a nonnegative bounded Borel function on Rd × Rd, then for every t > 0, (p, ), (p, )  Rd × R and   (1, )

One may now integrate this inequality as in the proof of [1, Proposition 3.4] or [5, Proposition 2.10] to get the desired result.

It is known that Wang-type Harnack inequalities as in Theorem 2.2 are equivalent to certain Lq estimates for the heat kernel of the diffusion. More specifically, for t > 0, we denote by pt(·, ·) : R2d × R2d  R the fundamental solution for the Kolmogorov operator on R2d, and also when appropriate pt(·) = pt(0, ·) : R2d  R. The following result is an immediate consequence
of Theorem 2.2; see for example [5, Lemma 2.11] taking q = 1/( - 1) for
  (1, 2) and y = 0.

this case, for each ,  0, we define a first-order differential symmetric bilinear form , : C Rd × R × C Rd × R  R associated to the

Recall that the intrinsic (control) distance associated to , is defined as d,((p, ), (p, )) := sup f (p, ) - f (p, ) : f  C Rd × R , ,(f ) 1 .

The control distance may be computed explicitly as follows.

and the conclusion follows from the standard Euclidean case.

For now, we make the following assumption on the function F defining the diffusion.

Assumption 2.5. For F : Rd  R, there exist constants m, M > 0 such that for every i = 1, · · · , d and p  Rd

Note that the lower bound on the derivatives implies for example that the range of F is unbounded. Under this assumption, we have the following key proposition.

and the desired result follows from summing over i.

We will use Proposition 2.6 and the fact that , and  satisfy the commutation relation

Since this holds for any nonnegative bounded Borel functions f : RI ×R  R and g : RIc  R, we conclude that the Wang-type Harnack inequality for Pt holds for any nonnegative bounded Borel function Rd × R  R.

Now the same kind of tensorization argument from the proof of Theorem 2.11 can be adapted to deal with certain functions F taking values in Rr.
In particular, we make the following assumption.

Assumption 2.12. For F : Rd  Rr, there exist non-empty disjoint subsets I1, . . . , Ir  {1, · · · , d} and constants m1, M1, . . . , mr, Mr > 0 such that for each j = 1, . . . , r, for every i  Ij and p  Rd,

and,

for

every

Note that the assumption that the subsets Ij are non-empty excludes F having some constant coordinates, and again the lower bound on the
derivatives implies more generally that the range of F is unbounded in each
coordinate. The disjointness of the Ij's implies that the coordinates of F (B) are independent.

We omit the proof here, but the argument follows exactly as in the proof of Theorem 2.11, relying on the key assumption that the coordinates of F rely on disjoint collections of coordinates, and thus the generator may be

As in Section 2.1, we know this Wang-type Harnack inequality is equiv-

alent to an integrated Harnack inequality for the heat kernel of the dif-

fusion, which we express in the following Proposition. For t > 0, let pt : Rd+r × Rd+r  R denote the fundamental solution, that is, the heat kernel, of the generator on Rd+r.

Proposition 2.14 (Integrated Harnack inequality). Suppose F : Rd  Rr satisfies Assumption 2.12.Then for any t > 0, (p, )  Rd × Rr, and q

With this result in hand, we are now ready to introduce the infinitedimensional diffusions of interest.

3. Infinite-dimensional results
Let (W, H, µ) be an abstract Wiener space, where W is a separable Banach space equipped with Gaussian measure µ and H is the associated CameronMartin Hilbert space. For background about abstract Wiener spaces, see for example [6] or [16]. We use · H and · W for the norms on H and W , respectively. The inner product on H is denoted by ·, · H .
As usual, H denotes the dual space of H which is of course isomorphic to H. Furthermore, let H be the set of h  H such that ·, h H  H extends to a continuous linear functional on W . We will continue to denote the continuous extension of ·, h H to W by ·, h H . Equivalently, we can define H as follows. Let i : H  W be the inclusion map, and let i : W   H be its transpose so that i :=   i for all   W . Then
H = {h  H : ·, h H  Range(i)  H} .
Note that since H is a dense subspace of W , i is injective and thus has a dense range. For any h  H the map h  ·, h H  H is a linear isometric

14

BAUDOIN, GORDINA, AND MELCHER

isomorphism, therefore it follows that if h  H then h  ·, h H  W  is a linear isomorphism also, and so H is a dense subspace of H.
Suppose that P : H  H is a finite rank orthogonal projection such that P H  H. Let {ej}nj=1 be an orthonormal basis for P H and j := ·, ej H  W . Then we may extend P to a unique continuous operator from W  H
(still denoted by P ) by letting

P w :=

w, ej H ej = j (w) ej for all w  W.

j=1

For more details on these projections see [9].

Notation 3.1. Let Proj(W ) denote the collection of finite rank projections on W such that
(1) P W  H and (2) P |H : H  H is an orthogonal projection, that is, P has the form
given in equation (3.2).

We will say a function f : W  R is a (smooth) cylinder function if it

may be written as f =   P for some P  Proj (W ) and some (smooth) function  : Rn  R, where n is the rank of P .

Given f : W  R, we say that f is H-differentiable at w  W if (h) :=

f (w + h), considered as a function on H, is Fr´echet differentiable at 0. If f

is H-differentiable on W , we denote by f : W  H the mapping defined

by

f (w), h

H

=

hf (w)

+ h).

In particular, let {ek} k=1 be an orthonormal basis of H such that ek  H

for all k and define k(w) = w, ek H . For each n, let Hn be the span of

{e1, . . . , en} identified with Rn, and define Pn  Proj (W ) by

Pn : W  Hn  H  H

as in (3.2). Then for a cylinder function of the form f (w) =   Pn(w) = (1(w), . . . , n(w))
n
f (w) = (ei )(1(w), . . . , n(w))ei.
i=1
Similarly we can define the second H-derivative 2, and finally

f (x) := tr 2f (x)

whenever 2f (x) exists and is of trace class.
Let B(W ) be the Borel -algebra on W . For t 0, let µt be the rescaled measure µt (A) := µ A/ t with µ0 = 0. As was first noted by L. Gross in [12, p. 135], there exists a stochastic process {Bt}t0 with values in W which is a.s. continuous in t with respect to the norm topology on W , has

QUASI-INVARIANCE FOR KOLMOGOROV DIFFUSIONS

15

independent increments, and, for s < t, Law(Bt - Bs) = µt-s, with B0 = 0 a.s. {Bt}t0 is called standard Brownian motion on (W, µ).
For A  B (W ), let µt (x, A) := µt (x - A). It is well known that {µt} forms a family of Markov transition kernels, and we may thus view (Bt, Px) as a strong Markov process with state space W , where Px is the law of x+B.

3.1. Infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov diffusion. We now consider W × W as an abstract Wiener space with respect to the product topology on W × W with product measure µ  µ. A cylinder function f : W × W  R is defined analogously as before, that is,

(3.3)

f (p, ) = (P p, P )

for some  : P H × P H  R and P  Proj(W ). Let {ej} j=1  H be an orthonormal basis for H. Then, for any smooth
cylinder function f on W × W of the form (3.3), we define


f (p, ) := ((0,ej)f ) (p, ) ej = P H (P p, P ) ,
j=1

pf (p, ) := ((ej,0)f ) (p, ) ej = pP H (P p, P ) ,
j=1

pf (p, ) := ((2ej,0)f ) (p, ) = pP H (P p, P ) .
j=1

Note that the sums in these definitions are finite as we only apply these operators to cylinder functions. Similarly, we may define the operators

(Lf ) (p, ) :=

and thus L and  are well-defined independent of the choice of basis in the

definition.

We now define an infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov diffusion, namely,

t
Xt := Bt, Bs ds .

Using an analogous computation to that in [17, Appendix], one may verify that the operator L defined by (3.4) is the generator of the diffusion Xt.

Proposition 3.2. Let {Pn} n=1  Proj(W ) such that Pn  IH , and consider the processes {Bn(t)}t0 in PnH and {Xn(t)}t0 in PnH × PnH defined by

Bn(t) := PnB(t)

and thus the desired convergence of Xn follows.

We now state the Cameron-Martin type quasi-invariance result for t = Law(Xt). We prove this as an application of the main theorem in [11]. However, to see how a direct proof would work, the reader may see the
proof of Theorem 3.8 in the next subsection.

Theorem 3.3. For any fixed t > 0, the measure t = Law(Xt) on W × W is quasi-invariant under the action by elements of the group H × H given by

(th,k)(p, ) := (p + h,  + k + th). Moreover, the Radon-Nikodym derivative of dth,k := ((th,k))t with respect to t satisfies, for any q  (1, ),

Proof. For fixed t > 0, define t : (H × H) × (W × W )  W × W by

t((h1, h2), (x1, x2)) := (x1 + h1, x2 + h2 + th1).

For each t, t defines a measurable group action of the abelian group H × H on W × W . Thus, in light of the estimates in Section 2.1, the proof is a
straightforward application of Theorem 3.2 of [11]. We fix any sequence of projections {Pn} n=1  Proj(W ) such that Pn  IH and let Hn = PnH. In the context of [11], Hn × Hn plays the role of both the finite-dimensional unimodular Lie subgroup of H ×H and the sequence of topological subspaces of W × W such that  n=1(Hn × Hn) is dense in W × W . Let tn := Law(Xtn) on Hn × Hn. Proposition 3.2 implies that

W ×W

f

dt

=

lim
n

(f  jn) dtn
Hn ×Hn

where jn : Hn × Hn  W × W is the continuous injection map. Proposition 2.3 provides the necessary uniform estimates on the Radon-Nikodym derivatives of the "shifted" measures in the finite-dimensional approximations (see (3.3) in [11]), and this completes the proof.

Remark 3.4. One can contrast this approach with a proof of quasi-invariance
through an application of the Cameron-Martin-Maruyama theorem on path
space. For t > 0 and for h, k  H, let Xth,k := (th,k)(Xt). Let Wt denote
the space of continuous paths  : [0, t]  W with (0) = 0, equipped
with the Gaussian measure µ = Law(B), and let Ht denote the associated Cameron-Martin subspace of finite-energy paths taking values in H. Let f
be a bounded continuous function on W × W . Then for any h, k  H, the
Cameron-Martin-Maruyama theorem on Wt implies that, for any   Ht, the translation B  B +  in Wt gives

t
E[f (Xth,k)] = E f Bt + h, (Bs + h) ds + k

3.2. Generalized Kolmogorov diffusions. As before, we let {Bt}t0 denote Brownian motion on (W, µ). Let V be a normed vector space, and consider a continuous function F : W  V . Define
t
Yt := Bt, F (Bs) ds .
0
We first consider natural approximations to the process Y . When F takes values in a finite-dimensional vector space, these approximations live in finite dimensions, but that assumption is not necessary for the following convergence result.

Proposition 3.5. Let {Pn} n=1  Proj(W ) be any collection of projections such that Pn  IH , and take

Bn(t) := PnB(t)  PnH

and Yn(t) :=
on PnH × F (PnH). Then

QUASI-INVARIANCE FOR KOLMOGOROV DIFFUSIONS

19

Proof. We have that Bn and B are a.s. (uniformly) continuous on [0, T ] and, by (3.5), a.s. Bn  B uniformly on [0, T ] in the W norm. Let


 := {Bn continuous}
n=1
 {B continuous}  {Bn  B uniformly on [0, T ] in W },
and note that P () = 1. For each    there exists M () <  and N1() such that Bn()(s) W , B()(s) W M () for all s  [0, T ] and n N1(). Since F is continuous, it is uniformly continuous on the closed ball of radius M (), and thus F (Bn()(s))  F (B()(s)) for all s  [0, T ]. More precisely, given  > 0, there exists  = (, M ()) > 0 such that for all x, y in the ball of radius M () in W , x - y W <  implies that F (x)-F (y) V < . Now choose N = N () such that for all n N N1(), Bn()(s) - B()(s) W <  for all s  [0, T ].
Now, F (Bn()) and F (B()) are uniformly continuous functions on [0, T ], and again for sufficiently large n we have that F (Bn()) V , F (B()) V C(, T ) on [0, T ]. So, for any   , F (Bn())  F (B()) in L1([0, T ], V ), and thus almost surely

Now that we have appropriate approximations in place, we formulate the following analogue of Assumption 2.12.

Assumption 3.6. Suppose F = (F1, . . . , Fr) : W  Rr such that each Fj is H-differentiable, and assume that there exist an orthonormal basis {ei} i=1  H of H, non-empty disjoint subsets I1, . . . , Ir  N, and constants m1, M1, . . . , mr, Mr > 0 such that for each j = 1, . . . , r, for all w  W

mj Fj (w), ei Mj, for all i  Ij

and Fj(w), ei = 0, for all i / Ij.

Fix the following notation.

Notation 3.7. Given an orthonormal basis {ei} i=1 of H and J  N, for h  H let

1/2

h J :=

| h, ei |2

iJ

20

BAUDOIN, GORDINA, AND MELCHER

Theorem 3.8. Suppose that Assumption 3.6 holds for F : W  Rr. Fix h  H and k  Rr and let t(h,k) denote the law of the process
t
Yt(h,k) = h + Bt, F (Bs + h) ds + k .
0
If for each j = 1, . . . , r,

(3.7)

| h, ei | < ,

then t(h,k) is mutually absolutely continuous with t := t0 and, for any q  (1, ),

dt(h,k) dt

with {ei} i=1  H is the orthonormal basis, Ij  N, and mj and Mj are the bounds introduced in Assumption 3.6.

Example 3.9. A natural and important class of examples satisfying As-
sumption 3.6 and the condition (3.7) includes functions F = (F1, . . . , Fr) such that each Fj is a cylinder function (that is, each Ij is a finite set) with

Fj (w) = j(wIj ),
where (wI ) := ( w, ei )iI for some {ei} i=1  H an orthornormal basis and functions j : RIj  R each satisfying Assumption 2.5. In this case, the quasi-invariance results of Theorem 3.8 hold for all (h, k)  H × Rr.
In particular, one could have r = 1 with #I1 = d and

F (w) = ( w, e1 , · · · , w, ed )

where e1, · · · , ed  H are orthornormal and the function  : Rd  R satisfies Assumption 2.5. In this case, with I = I1, m = m1, and M = M1, we would have that

Remark 3.10. Note that the setting of Theorem 3.8 does not technically fit the hypotheses of the main theorems in [10] or [11], as starting the diffusion at (h, k) does not constitute a translation of or other group action on the original diffusion. However, the proof given below is a direct analogy to the proofs in those references. Thus one may see that this approach for proving quasi-invariance works more generally; it seems only necessary that the transformation be measurable (of course), but it need not for example correspond to a group action.

Proof. Fix t > 0 and P0  Proj(W ). Let y = (h, k)  P0H × Rr and {Pn} n=1 be an increasing sequence of projections in Proj(W ) such that P0H  Hn = PnH for all n and Pn|H  IH . Let Yn(t) be as in Proposition 3.5 with V = Rr, and let tn = Law(Yn(t)) on Hn × Rr. Furthermore, let Bn := PnB,

noting that, since h  P0H  PnH,

implies that the upper bound is independent of n. By an analogous proof to that of Proposition 3.5 one may show that the
Yny approximate the process Y y, and thus for any bounded continuous f on W × Rr

Thus, we have proved that (3.9) holds for f  BC(W × Rr) and y  P Proj(W )P H × Rr. As this union is dense in H × Rr, dominated convergence along with the continuity of the norm and inner product in y implies that (3.9) holds for all y  H × Rr.
Since the bounded continuous functions are dense in Lq(W × Rr, t) (see
for example [14, Theorem A.1]) the inequality in (3.9) implies that, for all t > 0 and y = (h, k)  H × Rr, the linear functional yt : BC(W × Rr)  R defined by

yt (f ) =

f (x) dty(x)

W ×Rr

has a unique extension to an element of Lq(W × Rr, t), still denoted by yt , which satisfies the bound

Now restricting (3.10) to f  BC(W × Rr), we may rewrite this equation as

(3.11)

f (x) dty(x) =

f (x)Jty(x) dt(x).

W ×Rr

W ×Rr

Then a monotone class argument (again use [14, Theorem A.1 ]) shows that

(3.11) exists

is valid for all bounded measurable functions and is given by Jty, which is in Lq(t) for all

f q

on G. Thus,  (1, ) and

dty /dt satisfies

the desired bound.

The overall approach given above can be adapted to allow for functions F taking values in infinite-dimensional spaces. As an example, we will consider

QUASI-INVARIANCE FOR KOLMOGOROV DIFFUSIONS

23

the case that F takes values in W , but the technique could be modified to allow for F taking values in other infinite-dimensional spaces of interest. To begin, essentially the same proof of Proposition 3.5 yields the following modified convergence result for finite-dimensional approximations.

Proposition 3.11. Let {Pn} n=1  Proj(W ) be any collection of projections such that Pn|H  IH . Suppose that F : W  W is continuous and there exists an orthonormal basis {hj } j=1  H such that

n
F (PnB(t)), hj hj  F (B(t))
j=1

a.s. in W . Let {Qn} n=1  Proj(W ) denote the sequence of projections associated to {hj }j=1 and consider

t
Y~n(t) := PnB(t), QnF (PnB(s)) ds
0

on PnH × QnF (PnH). Then

lim max
n 0 t T

Y (t) - Y~n(t) W ×W = 0 a.s.

An example satisfying the hypotheses of Proposition 3.11 is the identity

function F (w) = w with Qn = Pn, or slightly more generally, we could

have F (B) = B, hj Ahj , where A is a continuous linear operator on

H; see Theorem 3.5.1 of [6]. Generally, if F (Bt), hj hj are independent

symmetric random values in W and QnF (PnBt)  F (Bt) in probability,

then [7, Proposition 2.11] implies that

 j=1

F (Bt), hj

hj

converges

almost

surely in W to F (Bt). We also provide the following example.

Example 3.12. Suppose that Fk := F, hk are cylinder functions

Fk(x) = k( w, ek )

where k : R  R is of the form

k(x) = x + ak ln(|x|)1{|x|>1}

with {ak}  2. Note that

ak ln(| Bt, hk |)1{| Bt,hk |1}hk
k=1
actually converges in H (versus W ) since for example, taking Btk := Bt, hk which is equal in distribution to a Normal(0, t) random variable Z for all k,

24

we have

For clarity we have kept this example as concrete as possible but there are

many generalizations, for example letting

k(x) = 2x + akg(x)1{|x|>1}
with g(x) = -x + x-p for any p > -1, or considering multivariate versions of fk.
Allowing built-in scaling as in the previous example, there are many functions F that one could consider (for example, g could be any function integrable with respect to the normal distribution so that k is continuous), but we have included the specific choices above with a view toward the following assumption which allows us to prove the necessary functional inequalities for the finite-dimensional approximations.

Assumption 3.13. Suppose F : W  W is a function satisfying the hy-
pothesis of Proposition 3.11. Assume that Fj := F, hj is H-differentiable for all j and that there exists an orthonormal basis {ei} i=1  H of H, nonempty disjoint subsets Ij  N and constants mj, Mj > 0 such that, for each j and for all w  W ,

mj Fj (w), ei Mj, for all i  Ij
and Fj(w), ei = 0, for all i / Ij.

Example 3.14. Note that the functions from Example 3.12 satisfy Assumption 3.13 with slight modifications for smoothness: let

k(x) = cx + ak g1(x)1{1-|x| 1+} + g2(x)1{|x|>1+}
with   (0, 1), with c = 1 and g2(x) = ln(|x|) or c = 2 and g2(x) = -x+x-p for any p > -1, and g1 a smooth function such that g1(±(1-)) = ±c(1-), g1(±(1 + )) = g2(±(1 + ))), g1 (±(1 - )) = c, and g1 (±(1 + )) = g2 (±(1 + )). For the given functions, it is clearly possible to define such a g1 so that g1 is bounded above and away from 0. Tai says: I should probably just say that g1 transitions smoothly from cx to g2(x) around x = 1.

Theorem 3.15. Suppose that Assumption 3.13 holds for F : W  W . Fix h, k  H, and let t(h,k) denote the law of the process
t
Yt(h,k) = h + Bt, F (Bs + h) ds + k .

where Ic := ( i=1Ij)c.

Proof. Fix t > 0, let {Pn} n=1  Proj(W ) be any collection of projections such that Pn  IH . Let {hj} j=1 be the orthonormal basis as in Assumption 3.13 with each Fj = F, hj H-differentiable, and let {Qn} n=1 be the associated sequence of projections. Fix n  N and take y = (h, k)  PnH × Qn F (Pn H). For n n, we take

t
Y~ny(t) := h + PnB(t), QnF (PnB(s) + h) ds + k

with tn,y = Law(Y~ny(t)). sition 2.14 to show that

Given Assumption 3.13, one again applies for each n the Radon-Nikodym derivative

Then in light of Proposition 3.11 (or rather its appropriate modification for Y y), if the limit on the right hand side remains bounded as n goes to ,
the proof follows as in Theorem 3.8.

Example 3.16. If each Fj is a cylinder function, that is, each Ij is finite, and mj m and Mj M for all j, then (3.12) holds if

and (3.12) would hold for all h, k  H. Thus, for example, for F as in Example 3.14, one has quasi-invariance for all h, k  H.
In the case that F (w) = w, we are back in the setting of Section 3.1 with a "standard" infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov diffusion as in Theorem 3.3, and Theorem 3.15 actually yields a better bound than Theorem 3.3 and is comparable with the path space Lq norm obtained in Remark 3.4, improving that estimate for q > 3. Here we can take hj = ej, and we have Ij = {j} and mj = Mj = 1 for all j, which gives the bound

Remark 3.17. As mentioned previously, these assumptions and the proof could be modified to consider functions F taking values in other infinitedimensional spaces. Another natural example in the present context would be F taking values in H.
