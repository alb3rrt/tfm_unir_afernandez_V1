Abstract
In this paper, we describe the structure of Malcev algebras M that contain the 3-dimensional simple central Lie algebra L := sl2(F ) such that mL = 0 for any m = 0 from M. Also we describe the structure of Malcev superalgebras M = M0  M1 such that M0 contains L with mL = 0 for any homogeneous elements 0 = m  M0  M1.
Keywords: Malcev algebra, non-Lie Malcev module, current Lie algebra, current Lie superalgebra, Kronecker factorization theorem.

1 Introduction

A Malcev algebra is a vector space M with a bilinear binary operation (x, y)  xy satisfying the following identities:

x2 = 0, J(x, y, xz) = J(x, y, z)x,

(1)

where J(x, y, z) = (xy)z + (yz)x + (zx)y is the Jacobian of the elements x, y, z  M.

Lie algebras fall into the variety of Malcev algebras because the Jacobian of any three elements vanish. The tangent space T (L) of an analytic Moufang loop L is another example of Malcev algebra. Let A be an alternative algebra, if we introduce a new product by means of a commutator [x, y] = xy - yx into A, we obtain a new algebra that will be denoted by A(-). It is easy to verify that the algebra A(-) is a Malcev algebra. All Malcev algebras obtained in this form are called special. A classic example of a non-Lie Malcev algebra M of the traceless elements of the Cayley-Dickson algebra with the commutator of dimension 7 is one of most cornerstone examples.
The description of the structure of algebras and superalgebras that contain certain finitedimensional algebras and superalgebras has a rich history, which has important applications in representation theory and category theory (for example, see [6, 8, 10, 15]). The classical Wedderburn Theorem says that if a unital associative algebra A contains a central simple subalgebra of finite dimension B with the same identity element, then A is isomorphic to a Kronecker product S F B, where S is the subalgebra of the elements that commute with each b  B. In particular, if A contains Mn(F) as subalgebra with the same identity element, we have A = Mn(S) "coordinated" by S. Kaplansky in Theorem 2 of [7] generalized the Wedderburn result to the alternative algebras A and the split Cayley algebra B. Jacobson in Theorem 1 of [5] gave a new proof of the result of Kaplansky using his classification of completely reducible alternative bimodules over a field of characteristic different of 2 and finally the first author in [11] proved that this result is valid for any characteristic. Using this result, Jacobson [5] proved a Kronecker Factorization Theorem for Jordan algebras that contain the Albert algebra with the same identity element. The statements of this type are usually called Kronecker factorization theorems. In the case of right alternative algebras, S. Pchelintsev, O. Shashkov and I. Shestakov [16] proved that every unital right alternative bimodule over a Cayley algebra (over an algebraically closed field of characteristic not 2) is alternative and they used that result to prove a coordinatization theorem for unital right alternative algebras containing a Cayley subalgebra with the same unit. Also in the paper [10] the author proved an analogue of the Kronecker factorization theorem for Malcev algebras that contain M which was used to prove certain category equivalences when the characteristic of the base field is not equal to 2 and 3.
In the case of superalgebras, M. López-Díaz and I. Shestakov [9, 8] studied the representations of simple alternative and exceptional Jordan superalgebras in characteristic 3 and through these representations, they obtained some analogues of the Kronecker Factorization Theorem for these superalgebras. Also, the first author [11] obtained analogues of the Kronecker Factorization Theorem for some central simple alternative superalgebras, where in particular the Kronecker Factorization Theorem for M(1|1)(F) answers the analogue for superalgebras of the Jacobson's problem [5], which was recently solved by the first author and I. Shestakov [12, 13] in the split case. Similarly, C. Martinez and E. Zelmanov [14] obtained a Kronecker Factorization Theorem for the exceptional ten dimensional Kac superalgebra K10. Also, Y. Popov [17] studied the representations of simple finite-dimensional noncommutative Jordan superalgebras and proved some analogues of the Kronecker factorization

theorem for such superalgebras. The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we provided some definitions about
Malcev algebras and superalgebras and their representations. In Section 3, we describe the structure of the Malcev algebras M that contain the 3-dimensional simple Lie algebra sl2(F ). In Section 4, we describe the structure of the Malcev superalgebras M = M0  M1 such that M0 contains sl2(F ).

2 Preliminaries

In this section we provide background material that is used along the way and some preliminary results.
Throughout this paper F will be a field of characteristic different of 2 and 3. So by (1), a Malcev algebra M is an anticommutative algebra that satisfies the identity

(xz)(yt) = ((xy)z)t + ((yz)t)x + ((zt)x)y + ((tx)y)z.

(2)

Also we will consider the following functions that play an important role in the theory of Malcev algebras:

J(x, y, z) = (xy)z + (yz)x + (zx)y, the Jacobian of x, y, z,
[x, y, z] = (xy)z + x(yz), the antiassociator, {x, y, z} = (xy)z - (xz)y + 2x(yz) = J(x, y, z) + 3x(yz) = [x, y, z] - [x, z, y],
h(y, z, t, x, u) = {yz, t, u}x + {yz, t, x}u + {yx, z, u}t + {yu, z, x}t.

2.1 Malcev Modules

We first recall the Lie algebra sl2(F ) that has a basis {e, f, h} such that

eh = e,

f h = -f,

ef

=

1 2

h.

This algebra is simple central and it is one of the main objects of our paper. Let V be a vector space over F . The space V is said to be module for the Malcev algebra
M if there is an even F -linear map  : M - EndF (V )(x  x), such that the split null extension E = M  V , with multiplication determined by

(x + v)(y + w) = xy + (y(v) - x(w))

is a Malcev algebra. The map  is called a representation of M. The module V is irreducible if  = 0 and does not contain any proper submodule. Also,
V is said to be almost faithful if ker does not contain any nonzero ideal of M. A regular module, Reg M, for algebra M, is defined on the vector space M with the
action of M coinciding with the multiplication in M.

3

Example 2.1. The non Lie 2-dimensional module M2 for the Lie algebra sl2(F ) has a basis {u, v} such that
uh = u, vh = -v, ue = v, uf = 0, ve = 0, vf = -u.
In characteristic 3, this is a Lie module.

2.2 Malcev superalgebras and their representations
Let now M = M0  M1 be a superalgebra (this is, Z2-graded algebra) and let G = G0  G1 be the Grassmann algebra generated by the elements 1, e1, . . . , en, . . . over a field F . The Grassmann envelope of M is defined to be G(M) := G0  M0 + G1  M1. Then M is said to be Malcev superalgebra if G(M) is a Malcev algebra. From this definition, M satisfies the following superidentities

xy = -(-1)|x||y|yx,

(3)

(-1)|y||z|(xz)(yt) = ((xy)z)t + (-1)|x|(|y|+|z|+|t|)((yz)t)x

+ (-1)(|x|+|y|)(|z|+|t|)((zt)x)y

(4)

+ (-1)(|x|+|y|+|z|)|t|((tx)y)z.

where x, y, z  M0  M1 and |x| denotes the parity index of a homogeneous element x of M: |x| = i if x  Mi.
In any Malcev superalgebra M = M0  M1, the identities for Malcev algebras are easily superized to obtain the analogous graded identities. Thus, for homogeneous elements x, y, z, t, u  M we define

J~(x, y, z) = (xy)z - x(yz) - (-1)|y||z|(xz)y, (super Jacobian),

(5)

{x, y, z}~ = (xy)z - (-1)|y||z|(xz)y + 2x(yz),

(6)

h~(y, z, t, x, u) = {yz, t, u}~x + (-1)|x||u|{yz, t, x}~u + (-1)|x|(|z|+|t|+|u|)+|u||t|{yx, z, u}~t + (-1)|u|(|z|+|t|)+|x||t|{yu, z, x}~t. (7)

Similarly, we define p~(x, y, z, t). If V = V0  V1 is a Z2-graded F -space, then EndF (V ) becames an associative superal-
gebra with EndF (V )0 = {  EndF (V ) : (Vi)  Vi, i = 0, 1},

EndF (V )1 = {  EndF (V ) : (Vi)  V1-i, i = 0, 1}.
The space V is said to be module for the Malcev superalgebra M if there is an even F -linear map  : M - EndF (V )(x  x), such that the split null extension E = M  V , with

4

Z2-grading given by E0 = M0  V0, E1 = M1  V1, and with multiplication determined for homogeneus elements by
(x + v)(y + w) = xy + (y(v) - (-1)|x||w|x(w))
is a Malcev superalgebra. The map  is called a (super)-representation of M. When dealing with superalgebras, the ideals or submodules will always be graded. The
module V is irreducible if  = 0 and does not contain any proper submodule. Also, V is said to be almost faithful if ker does not contain any nonzero ideal of M.
Let V be a module over the Malcev superalgebra M and let E = M  V be the corresponding split null extension. Let us consider
i = {  EndF(E)i : (xy) = x(y) = (-1)i|y|(x)y  x, y  E0  E1}, i = 0, 1,
 = (E) = 0  1, the supercentroid of E, Z = Z(E) = {   : V   V and M  M}, Ki = Ki(V ) = {  EndF(V )i : x = (-1)i|x|x  x  M0  M1}, i = 0, 1, K = K(V ) = K0  K1, the supercentralizer of V. The following proposition provides some basic properties of the subsuperalgebras Z and K when we consider irreducible almost faithful modules.
Proposition 2.2 ([2], Proposition 4). Assume that V is an irreducible almost faithful module for M. Then
(i) Z1 = 0 and Z = Z0 is an integral domain which acts without torsion on M.
(ii) K0 is a skew field and any nonzero homogeneous element in K acts bijectively on V .
(iii) The restriction homomorphism  : Z - K0( - |V ) is one-to-one.
The Proposition 2.2 can be easily statement for algebras and its proof is analogous.
3 Algebras satisfying the identity h = 0
Let M be a Malcev algebra and let H(M) be the subspace spanned by the elements h(y, z, t, u, x); H(M) is an ideal of M (see [3]). The variety H is defined as the class of Malcev algebras over F that satisfy the identity h(y, z, t, u, x) = 0, that is, H(M) = 0.
Throughout this section, let us consider Malcev algebras in the category H. The most important finite-dimensional elements of the variety H are the 3-dimensional simple Lie algebra sl2(F ) and the 7-dimensional simple non-Lie Malcev algebra M over its centroid , which is a field (see [1]).
5

The structure of the Malcev algebras and superalgebras that contain M can be found in [10]. So in this section and the next we will study Malcev algebras and superalgebras that contain sl2(F ).
Let M be a Malcev algebra and consider the following function (see [4])
p(x, y, z, t) = -{zt, x, y} - {yt, z, x} + {xt, y, z}.
The following lemma will be needed to establish some important elements in (M) (the centroid of M).
Lemma 3.1 ([18, 2], Lemma 2). Let M be a Malcev algebra. Then for any x, y, z, t, u  M:

p(x, y, z, t)u = p(xu, y, z, t),

(8)

p(x, y, z, ut) = p(x, u, t, yz). The following theorem is a consequence of ([1], Theorem 5) for algebras. Theorem 3.2. Let M be a simple algebra and let V be a module for M. Then V is completely reducible. Let us define the operator (y, z, t)  EndF (M) by
x(y, z, t) = p(x, y, z, t).

It follows from (8) that (y, z, t)  (M) for any y, z, t  M. Now let V be a Malcev module over L := sl2(F ). The following Lemma was proved in
[18] under the assumption that V = V L, but in the Theorem 13 of [1] was proved without that condition. The result says that V is decomposable as the direct sum of a Lie module and a non-Lie module over L.

Lemma 3.3. Let V be a Malcev module over L such that vL = 0 for any v = 0 from V . Then V = Vl  Vm, where Vl is a L-module, and the L-submodule Vm satisfies the condition that for any a, b  L and v  Vm
vab - vba + 2v · ab = 0.
Also Vl = {v  V : J(v, L, L) = 0} and Vm = {v  V : {v, L, L} = 0}.
Let M be a Malcev algebra that contains L such that mL = 0 for any m = 0 from M. So we can consider M as a Malcev module over L, then by Lemma 3.3 and by the proof of Theorem 3.2 we have
M = Ml  Mm,

6

where Ml =

Li and Mm = M2i, M2i is a non Lie 2-dimensional module

0=i (M,L,L)

i

for the Lie algebra L that has a basis {ui, vi} (see Example 2.1) satisfying

uih = ui, vih = -vi, uie = vi, uif = 0, vie = 0, vif = -ui.

(9)

The following result provides that Ml is a subalgebra of M.
Lemma 3.4. Ml is a subalgebra of M and MlMm  Mm.
Proof: By Lemma 3.3, we have Ml = {m  M : J(m, L, L) = 0} and Mm = {m  M : {m, L, L} = 0}. Then for any ,  in (M)

J((L)(L), L, L)  J(L2, L, L)  J(L, L, L) = 0,

so (L)(L)  Ml and MlMl  Ml. This show that Ml is a subalgebra of M. Similarly

{(L)Mm, L, L}  {(LMm), L, L}  {Mm, L, L} = 0, then (L)Mm  Mm and MlMm  Mm.

Q.E.D.

The following proposition provides an analogous of the Kronecker factorization theorem for A := Ml.
Proposition 3.5. Let A be the subalgebra of M. Then A is a current Lie algebra, that is, A = L F U, where U is a certain conmutative associative algebra.

Proof: We have A =

Li. Let U = i F i denote the span of all elements

0=i (M,L,L)
i. Then A = LU. So let us prove that U is a subalgebra of (M). We fix arbitrary elements ,   U and a, b  L. So a  A because J(a, L, L) 

J(a, L, L) = 0, then a = i aii for some ai  L and i  U . We denote w = a - i aii = 0,

w = (e + f + h) - (ie + if + ih)i = 0,

(10)

i

where a = e + f + h, ai = ie + if + ih and 0 = , , , , i, i, i are elements of F . As   (M) and using the multiplication table of L, from (10)

,

i

which implies, e = e, where  = i i-1i  U . Then e( - ) = 0. Also, it is easy to see f ( - ) = 0 and h( - ) = 0; so

L( - ) = 0

and  -  = 0. Therefore  =   U; UU  U. Now consider m  M and a  L, then

((m))a = (m)(a) = ((m)a) = (m(a)) = (m)(a) = ((m)a) = ((m))a.

If [, ] =  - , we have
(M[, ])L = 0;
so M[, ] = 0 and [, ]|M = 0. In particular, [, ]|Vi = 0 for any irreducible component Vi of M, then by a version for algebras of the Proposition 2.2(iii) we get [, ] = 0 because  : Z - K( - |Vi) is one-to-one. Therefore [U, U] = 0; hence U is a commutative and associative algebra.
Also
(a)(b) = (a(b)) = ((ab)) = (ab)() = (ab)().

Let v = 0 = e(ev) =

e1 + f 2 + h3 = 0 be, where i  U . Then 0 = ev =

Similarly

so

and

L2 = 0

and 2 = 0. Hence i = 0 for i = 1, 3. Therefore A = L F U .

Q.E.D.

The following lemma provides that the multiplication in Mm is zero.
Lemma 3.6. M2m = 0.
Proof: We have Mm = i M2i, i  I. Let M2i and M2j be the non Lie 2-dimensional Malcev modules over L with the standard bases {ui, vi} and {uj, vj} respectively. Then from (9) for all i, j

-(uivj)f = (uivj)(f h) (=2) ((uif )vj)h + ((f vj)h)ui + ((vjh)ui)f + ((hui)f )vj = (ujh)ui - (vjui)f - (uif )vj = ujui - (vjui)f

8

we get

(uivj )f

=

-

1 2

uiuj

.

(11)

Also

-(vivj)f = (vivj)(f h) (=2) ((vif )vj)h + ((f vj)h)vi + ((vjh)vi)f + ((hvi)f )vj = -(uivj)h + (ujh)vi - (vjvi)f + (vif )vj = -(uivj)h + ujvi + (vivj)f - uivj

and

(vivj )f

=

1 2

{(uivj

)h

- ujvi

+

uivj }.

(12)

Similarly

1 2

(uivj

)h

=

(uivj)(ef )

(=2)

((uie)vj )f

+

((evj)f )ui

+

((vjf )ui)e

+

((f ui)e)vj

=

(vivj )f

- (ujui)e

(1=2)

1 2

{(uivj

)h

-

uj vi

+

uivj }

-

(uj ui )e.

Hence

(uj ui)e

=

1 2

{uivj

+

vi uj }.

(13)

Moreover

-(uiuj)f = (uiuj)(f h) (=2) ((uif )uj)h + ((f uj)h)ui + ((ujh)ui)f + ((hui)f )uj = (ujui)h - (uif )uj = (ujui)h

and

(uiuj)f = (uiuj)h.

(14)

Now

uiuj = (uih)(ujh) (=2) ((uiuj)h)h + ((ujh)h)ui + ((hh)ui)uj + ((hui)uj)h = ((uiuj)h)h + (ujh)ui - (uiuj)h (1=4) ((uiuj)f )h + ujui - (uiuj)h,

then

2uiuj = ((uiuj)f )h - (uiuj)h (=2) (uif )(ujh) - ((ujf )h)ui - ((f h)ui)uj - ((hui)uj)f - (uiuj)h = (f ui)uj + (uiuj)f - (uiuj)h (1=4) 0;

therefore

uiuj = 0.

(15)

9

Now, replacing (15) in (11) and (13) we have (uivj)f = 0 and

uivj = -viuj.

(16)

We next find that
(viuj)h = ((uie)uj)h (=2) (uiuj)(eh) - ((euj)h)ui - ((ujh)ui)e - ((hui)e)uj (1=5) (vjh)ui - (ujui)e + (uie)uj (1=6) -vjui + viuj = 0,

then

(viuj)h = 0.

(17)

Also

(uivj)e = ((uih)vj)e (=2) (uivj)(he) - ((hvj)e)ui - ((vje)ui)h - ((eui)h)vj = -(uivj)e - (vje)ui + (vih)vj = -(uivj)e - vivj

and

(uivj

)e

=

-

1 2

vivj .

(18)

Also

vivj = (uie)(uje) (=2) ((uiuj)e)e + ((uje)e)ui + ((ee)ui)uj + ((eui)uj)e

=

(vj e)ui

-

(vi uj )e

(1=8)

-

1 2

vj

vi,

which implies that

vivj = 0.

(19)

Finally

uivj = (uih)(uje) (=2) ((uiuj)h)e + ((ujh)e)ui + ((he)ui)uj + ((eui)uj)h = (uje)ui - (eui)uj - (viuj)h (1=7) vjui + viuj (1=6) -2uivj,

and 3uivj = 0. So

uivj = 0.

Therefore from (15), (19) and (20) we get M2iM2j = 0 and M2m = 0.

(20) Q.E.D.

Example 3.7. We have the non Lie 5-dimensional Malcev algebra M5 = sl2(F)  M2 that contains sl2(F ) with M22 = 0. So M5 is the split null extension of M2 by sl2(F ).

10

Consider N := Mm. Then from (9) for any   A is easy to proof that N  is a non-Lie Malcev module over L and {N , L, L} = 0, then N   N . So (LU)N  (LN )U  N U  N . Hence 0 = N  M and from Lemma 3.6 we have N 2 = 0.
Therefore, by Lemmas 3.4 and 3.6, we have that M = A  N with N 2 = 0 is the split null extension of N by Lie algebra A.
With this, we reach our main results in the case of Malcev algebras.

Theorem 3.8. Let M be a Malcev algebra that contains L such that mL = 0 for any 0 = m from M. Then

M = L F U + N ,

where A is a certain conmutative associative algebra, with 0 = N  M and N 2 = 0, that is,

N

is

a

nilpotent

ideal with

index

of

nilpotency

2.

Also

M N

is

the

Lie

algebra

sl2(U )

over

U.

Proof: It follows directly from Proposition 3.5 and Lemma 3.6.

Q.E.D.

In

Theorem

3.8

we

can

say

that

the

algebra

M N

sl2(U )

is

"coordinated"

by

U.

Corollary 3.9. There are no semiprime Malcev algebras M that contain L such that mL = 0 for any 0 = m from M.

Proof: Let M be a semiprime Malcev algebra with the indicated conditions. Then by Theorem 3.8 there is an ideal 0 = N of M such that N 2 = 0, a contradiction.

Q.E.D.

4 Superalgebras satisfying the identity h~ = 0

The variety H of superalgebras is the class of Malcev superalgebras in which h~ = 0 (h~ is defined in (7)). Throughout this section we will assume that all Malcev superalgebra belong to H. Let M a Malcev superalgebra, then by Lemma 3.1

p~(x, y, z, t)u = (-1)|u|(|y|+|z|+|t|)p~(xu, y, z, t),

(21)

p~(x, y, z, ut) = (-1)(|u|+|t|)(|y|+|z|)p~(x, u, t, yz)

for any homogeneous elements x, y, z, t, u  M. Let us define the operator ~(y, z, t)  EndF (M) by

x~(y, z, t) = p~(x, y, z, t).

It follows from (21) that ~(y, z, t)  (M) for any y, z, t  M. Now let M = M0  M1 be a Malcev superalgebra such that the even part M0 contains
L with mL = 0 for all homogeneous elements 0 = m  M0  M1. Then we consider M as a Malcev module over L, so by Lemma 3.3 and by the proof of Theorem 3.2 we have M0 = Ml0  Mm0, M1 = Ml1  Mm1 and

11

where

M = Ml0  Mm0  Ml1  Mm1,

Ml0 =

Li, Ml1 =

Li,

0=i (M0 ,L,L)

0=i  (M1 ,L,L)

Mm0 = M2i and Mm1 = M2i

i

i

here M2i and M2i are non Lie 2-dimensional modules for the Lie algebra L with bases {ui, vi} and {ui, vi} respectively and both satisfy (9) (see Example 2.1).
From (5), using the same arguments of the proof of Lemma 3.4 and by the Z2-grading of M is easy to proof that M = Ml0 + Ml1 is a subsuperalgebra of M.
The following proposition provides an analogous of the Kronecker factorization theorem
for M.

Proposition 4.1. Let M be the subsuperalgebra of M. Then M is a current Lie superalgebra, that is, M = L F U, where U = U0  U1 is a certain supercommutative associative superalgebra.

Proof: We have Ml0 =

Li and Ml1 =

Lj. Let U0 = i F i

0=i (M0 ,L,L)

0=j (M1,L,L)

and U1 = j F j denote the span of all elements i and j respectively. Then Ml0 = L U0, Ml1 = L U1 and M = L U0 + L U1.

So let us go to prove that U = U0  U1 is a subsuperalgebra of (M). For all a, b  L

we have

(a)(b) = (-1)||(|b|+||)(a(b)) = (-1)||(|b|+||)((ab)) = (-1)||(|b|+||)(ab)(). (22)

So by (22) and using the relationships

MliMlj  Ml((i+j)mod 2), i, j = 0, 1

of the Z2-grading of M and the proof of the Proposition 3.5, we get
UiUj  U(i+j)mod 2, i, j = 0, 1.
Hence U = U0  U1 is a subsuperalgebra. We fix arbitrary homogeneous elements ,   U, m  M and a  L, then
((m))a = (-1)|a|||(m)(a) = (-1)|a|(||+||)+||||(m(a)) = (-1)||(|a|+||)((m)a) = (-1)||||((m))a.

If [, ] =  - (-1)||||, we have

12

(M[, ])L = 0,

so M[, ] and [, ]|M = 0. In particular, [, ]|Vi = 0 for any irreducible components Vi of M, then by Proposition 2.2(iii) [, ] = 0 because  : Z - U( - |Vi) is one-to-one. Therefore [U, U] = 0; hence U is a supercommutative and associative superalgebra.
Also, by (22) and [U, U] = 0

(a)(b) = (-1)||(|b|+||)(ab)() = (-1)||(|b|+||)(-1)||||(ab)() = (-1)|||b|(ab)()

for all a, b  L. As in the Proposition 3.5, using the multiplication table of L, it is easy to see that the
superalgebra U is free over L. Therefore M = L F U.
Q.E.D.

As in Lemma 3.6 the following lemma provides that the multiplication in Mm0 and Mm1 is zero.
Lemma 4.2. M2m0 = M2m1 = 0.
Proof: As M0 is a subalgebra of M. Therefore, by Lemma 3.6 we have M2m0 = 0. We have Mm1 = i M2i, i  J. Let M2i and M2j be non Lie 2-dimensional Malcev
modules over L with the standard bases {ui, vi} and {uj, vj} respectively. Then from (9) for all i, j

-(uivj)f = (uivj)(f h) (=4) ((uif )vj)h - ((f vj)h)ui - ((vjh)ui)f + ((hui)f )vj = -(ujh)ui + (vjui)f - (uif )vj = -ujui + (uivj)f (=3) -uuj + (uivj)f

and

(uivj )f

=

1 2

uiuj

.

(23)

Moreover

-(vivj)f = (uivj)(f h) (=4) ((vif )vj)h - ((f vj)h)vi - ((vjh)vi)f + ((hvi)f )vj = -(uivj)h - (ujh)vi + (vjvi)f + (vif )vj (=3) -(uivj)h - ujvi + (vivj)f - uivj

and

(vi vj )f

=

1 2

{(uivj

)h

+

uj vi

+

ui vj }.

(24)

13

Similarly

1 2

(uivj

)h

=

(uivj)(ef )

(=4)

((uie)vj )f

-

((evj)f )ui

-

((vjf )ui)e

+

((f ui)e)vj

=

(vi vj )f

+

(uj ui )e

(2=4)

1 2

{(uivj

)h

+

uj vi

+

uivj} +

(uj ui)e.

Hence

(uj ui )e

=

-

1 2

{uivj

+

uj vi }.

(25)

Also

-(uiuj)f = (uiuj)(f h) (=4) ((uif )uj)h - ((f uj)h)ui - ((ujh)ui)f + ((hui)f )uj = -(ujui)h - (uif )uj = -(ujui)h (=3) -(uiuj)h

and

(uiuj)f = (uiuj)h.

(26)

Now

uiuj = (uih)(ujh) (=4) ((uiuj)h)h - ((ujh)h)ui + ((hh)ui)uj + ((hui)uj)h = ((uiuj)h)h - (ujh)ui - (uiuj)h (2=6) ((uiuj)f )h - ujui - (uiuj)h,

then from (3)

2uiuj = ((uiuj)f )h - (uiuj)h (=4) (uif )(ujh) + ((ujf )h)ui - ((f h)ui)uj - ((hui)uj)f - (uiuj)h = (f ui)uj + (uiuj)f - (uiuj)h (2=6) 0;

so

uiuj = 0.

(27)

Replacing (27) in (23) and (25) we have (uivj)f = 0 and

uivj = -ujvi.

(28)

Next, we have

(viuj)h = ((uie)uj)h (=4) (uiuj)(eh) + ((euj)h)ui + ((ujh)ui)e - ((hui)e)uj = (uiuj)e - (vjh)ui + (ujui)e + (uie)uj (2=7) vjui + viuj (2=8) 0,

14

then

(viuj)h = 0.

(29)

Also

(uivj)e = ((uih)vj)e (=4) (uivj)(he) + ((hvj)e)ui + ((vje)ui)h - ((eui)h)vj = -(uivj)e + (vje)ui + (vih)vj = -(uivj)e - vivj

and

(uivj

)e

=

-

1 2

vivj .

(30)

Furthermore,

vivj = (uie)(uje) (=4) ((uiuj)e)e - ((uje)e)ui + ((ee)ui)uj + ((eui)uj)e

=

-(vj e)ui

- (viuj)e

(3=0)

1 2 vjvi,

which implies that

vivj = 0.

(31)

Similarly

uivj = (uih)(uje) (=4) ((uiuj)h)e - ((ujh)e)ui + ((he)ui)uj + ((eui)uj)h = -(uje)ui - (eui)uj - (viuj)h (2=9) -vjui + viuj (=3) -uivj + viuj,

then 2uivj = viuj (2=8) -uivj, 3uivj = 0 and

uivj = 0.

(32)

Therefore from (27), (31) and of the last equality we get M2iM2j = 0 and M2m1 = 0. Q.E.D.

The proof of the following result is straightforward and analogous of the proof of Lemma 3.6. We do not include the process because basically use the identities (3) and (4) with respect to the parity of the homogeneous elements as in Lemma 4.2.

Lemma 4.3. Mm0Mm1 = 0.
Denote N := Mm0  Mm1. Then for any homogeneous element 0 =   U0  U1 and from (9) is easy to proof that N  is a non-Lie Malcev module over L and {N , L, L}~  {N , L, L}~ (=6) {N , L, L} = 0, then N   N . So (L U)N  (LN )U  N U  N . Hence 0 = N  M and by Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3 we have N 2 = 0.
With this, we reach our main results in the case of Malcev superalgebras.

Theorem 4.4. Let M = M0  M1 be a Malcev superalgebra such that M0 contains L with mL = 0 for all homogeneous elements 0 = m  M0  M1. Then
M = L F U + N ,
where U is a certain supercommutative associative superalgebra, with 0 = N  M and N 2 = 0, that is, N is a nilpotent ideal with index of nilpotency 2. Also M is the Lie
N
superalgebra sl2(U) over U.
Proof: The Theorem follows from Proposition 4.1 and Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3.

Q.E.D.

Also

in

Theorem

4.4

we

can

say

that

the

Lie

superalgebra

M N

=

sl2(U )

is

"coordinated"

by U. In addition, M = M  N with N 2 = 0 is the split null extension of N by Lie

superalgebra M.

Corollary 4.5. There are no semiprime Malcev superalgebras M = M0  M1 such that M0 contains L with mL = 0 for all homogeneous elements 0 = m  M0  M1.
Proof: Let M be a semiprime Malcev superalgebra with the indicated conditions. Then by Theorem 4.4 there is an ideal 0 = N of M such that N 2 = 0, a contradiction.
