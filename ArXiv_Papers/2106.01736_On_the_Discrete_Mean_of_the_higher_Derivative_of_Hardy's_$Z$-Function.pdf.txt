arXiv:2106.01736v1 [math.NT] 3 Jun 2021

Abstract. Yildirim obtained an asymptotic formula of the dis-

crete

moment

of

|

(

1 2

+

it)|

over

the

zero

of

the

higher

derivatives

of Hardy's Z-function. We give a generalization of his result on

Hardy's Z-function.

1. Introduction

Hardy's Z-function is defined as

(1)

Z(t) = 

1 2

+

it

-

1 2



1 2

+

it

,

where (s) = 2ss-1 sin(s/2)(1-s) which comes from the functional equation for (s). In this paper, we discuss the mean value of Z(j)(t) over the zeros of Z(k)(t), where Z(j)(t) is the j-th derivative of Hardy's
Z-function. We denote the complex variable by s = +it with , t  R. Throughout this article, we assume that the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is true.
In 1985, Conrey and Ghosh [1] showed that

max 
<t+ 0<T

1 2

+

it

e2 - 4

5T L2,

where  and + are ordinates of consecutive zeros of (s) and L =

log

T 2

.

It

is known

that

the zeros

of the

derivative

of

Hardy's

Z -function

are interlaced with those of Hardy's Z-function. Thus this summand

means the extremal value of Hardy's Z-function. They calculated the

integral

where C is positively oriented rectangular path with vertices c + i,

c + iT ,

1 - c + iT

and

1-c+i

where

c

=

5 8

,

and

Z1(s)

is

defined

by

Indeed,

we

can

see

that

|Z1

(

1 2

=

|Z  (t)|.

On the other hand, Yildirim considered a generalization. He gave an

asymptotic formula

(k odd and k > 1) (k even),

where k runs over the zeros of the kth derivative of Hardy's Z-function.

He consider the logarithmic derivative of Zk(s, T ) =

L 2

In this article, we will prove the following theorem.

Theorem 1.1. Let j and k be fixed non-negative integers. If RH is true, then as T  ,

and

When j = 0 or k = 0, we consider the sums on the right-hand side as

Therefore we can write the approximate formula in the form Cj,kT L2j+2.
Remark 1. Matsuoka [6] proved that the zeros of Z(k+1)(t) are interlaced with those of Z(k)(t) for sufficiently large t. Therefore our sum contains the mean square of the extremal value of |Z(j)(t)|.

Remark 2. When k = 2, it is not clear whether the coefficient of Yildirim's asymptotic formula is positive or negative, hence his result does not give precise information, and our main theorem too. This is because we have no exact information on the location of zeros of Z2(s, T ) near s = 1. In general, it is difficult to confirm even Cj,k  0. However, we can verify Ck,k = 0 because it is known that

k g=1

=

(-1)k+1 + 1 k!(k + 1)!

and (see [10]).

2. Preliminaries

We introduce a meromorphic function associated with k-th deriva-
tives of Hardy's Z-function. Let Z0(s) = (s), and for k  1, we define Zk(s) as

(4)

Zk(s)

=

Zk -1(s)

-

1 2

(s)Zk-1(s).

Furthermore let f0(s) = 1, and we define fk(s), for k  1, as

fk(s)

=

fk -1(s)

-

1 2

(s)fk-1(s).

Then we can see that

(5)

k
Zk(s) =

k µ

fk-µ (s) (µ)(s)

µ=0

by induction on k. Actually,

Zk+1(s)

To show the last equality, we use

=

.

Remark 3. It is Matsuoka [6] who defined Zk(s) and fk(s) as above, and he use the notation fk(s) as Zk(s) and does hk(s) as fk(s). However, Yildirim gave another definition of Zk(s), namely

Zk(s)

=

((s))

1 2

dk dsk

(((s))-

1 2

 (s)).

It is possible to see that this definition coincides with our definition. The representation (5) is inspired by the work of Matsumoto and Tanigawa [5].

We give some properties of Zk(s).

Lemma 2.1. For k = 0, 1, 2, · · · , Zk(s) has the following properties.

(i) Z(k)(t) = ik

1 2

+ it

-

1 2

Zk

1 2

+ it

.

(ii) Zk(s) satisfies the functional equation

(6)

Zk(s) = (-1)k(s)Zk(1 - s)

for all s.

Proof. When k = 0, all the statements are trivial. For k = 1, see the proof of the lemma in [1]. By induction, we can prove the both of two statements for k  1. In fact, when we derivate the equation in (i), we see that

Z (k+1)(t)

= ik+1

And by the definition, we have

Zk+1(s)

=

Zk (s)

-

1 2



(s)Zk

(s)Zk(1

-

s)

= (-1)k+1(s)Zk+1(1 - s).

This lemma is proved by Matsuoka [6], but we reproduce the proof here because [6] is unpublished.
There are some results on the zeros of higher derivatives of Hardy's Z-function. Let N (T, Zk) be the number of zeros of Zk(s) in the region {s =  + it | 1 - 2m <  < 2m, 0  t  T }, where m = m(k) is a sufficiently large positive integer.

Lemma 2.2. For any non-negative k we have

N (T, Zk)

=

T 2

log

T 2

-

T 2

+

Ok(log T ).

This is Theorem 3 in [5] essentially. Actually, Matsumoto and Tanigawa proved this statement for k(s), where

1(s)

=

 (s)

-

2 (s)



(s)

and

k+1(s) =

 

(s)

-

1 2

(s)

k(s) + k (s).

We

can

see

that

-

1 2

(s)k(s)

=

Zk(s)

by

induction.

The

case

k

is

trivial. We assume the case k  1 is true. Then

Lemma 2.3 (see the proof of Theorem 2 in [5]). Assuming RH, Zk(s) has at most Ok(1) zeros with ordinates in (0, T ) off the critical line.

They proved that the difference of the number of zeros of Z(k)(t) and that of k(s) is Ok(1).

Lemma 2.4 (Lemma 4 in [11]). Assuming RH, the zeros of Zk(s) which

are

not

on



=

1 2

are

within

a

distance

1 9

from

the

line



=

1 2

.

From Lemma 2.2, we see that there exists a sequence of positive numbers {Tr} r=1(Tr   as r  ) such that if Zk(k + ik) = 0 then |k - Tr|-1 = Ok(log Tr). Moreover, Lemma 2.3 says that for
sufficiently T0 = T0(k), all zeros of Zk(s) for t > T0 is on the critical line. When we take T , we understand that it is > T0 and in {Tr} r=1 hereafter.

Zk(s, T ) has important properties for our purpose.

Lemma 2.5 (Lemma 5 in [11]). Assuming RH, we have

Zk Zk

-

Zk (s, T ) Zk

5 8

and

Lemma 2.6 (Lemma 6 in [11]). We assume RH and let k  1. At

s = 1 Zk(s, T ) has a pole of order k + 1. There are k zeros of Zk(s, T )

located

at

zg

=

1-

g

+ Ok

(g = 1, . . . , k), where g's are the

roots of

k µ µ=0 µ!

There are no other zeros or poles of Zk(s, T )

with

Thus

we

have

Zk (s, T ) Zk

-(k + 1) s-1

where, as T  , ak(m) = ak(m, L)  T  for any  > 0 and m  T .

Proof. This result has been proved in [2]

We can see that

Then, by the definition, for -1 <  < 2 and t  1

If RH is true, then the Lindelo¨f Hypohesis is also true. Therefore we can obtain the following estimates.

Lemma 2.10. If the RH is true, then for µ = 0, 1, 2, . . . and |t|  1,

When µ = 0, these estimates are well-known. For µ  1, we
can obtain this estimates, using Cauchy's theorem in a disk of radius (log(|t| + 2))-1 around s.
By (5), this lemma leads to

Lemma 2.11 (Lemma  in [9]). If f (s) is regular, and

We use this lemma with f (s) = Zk(s), r = 12 and s0 = 2 + iT . The estimate of Zk(s) implies that we can take M = log T in this lemma. Hence we have

3. The proof of the theorem

Our proof is inspired by the proof of Yildirim [11]. As we mentioned

before, we consider sufficiently large T in {Tr} r=1. This restriction will

be removed at the end of the proof. Now by Lemma 2.3, Zk(s) has

at most Ok(1) zeros off the critical line up to T . At such a zero, by

Lemma 2.4,

(-2)2j+1-u-µ-

Proof. Since

(1 + 1 - 2)2j+1-u

2j+1-u
=
µ=0

2j + 1 - u µ

2j+1-u-µ =0

2j + 1 - u - µ

we have

These sums are coefficients of xj and xj-u in (1 - x)2j+1-u(1 - x)-1 and are therefore equal to the coefficient of xj and xj-u in (1 - x)2j-u.
Thus we obtain

This completes the proof for the special T which are chosen at the beginning of the proof.
To complete the proof, we take away the condition on T . When T increases continuously in bounded interval, the number of relevant

|Z(j)(k)|2 is at most Ok(log T ) and the order is Oj(T ). Thus it is smaller than the error in our main theorem that the contribution of these terms. Thus the formula is true for all T > T0.
