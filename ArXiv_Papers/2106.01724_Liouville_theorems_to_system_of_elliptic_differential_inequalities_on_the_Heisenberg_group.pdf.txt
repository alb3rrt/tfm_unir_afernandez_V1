LIOUVILLE THEOREMS TO SYSTEM OF ELLIPTIC DIFFERENTIAL INEQUALITIES ON THE HEISENBERG
GROUP
YADONG ZHENG
Abstract. In this paper, we establish Liouville theorems for the following system of elliptic differential inequalities
Hum1 + ||H1 |v|p  0, Hvm2 + ||H2 |u|q  0, on different unbounded open domains of Heisenberg group H, including the whole space, and half space of H. Here p > m2 > 0, q > m1 > 0.

1. Introduction

Let H be Heisenberg group, which is topologically Euclidean but analytically non-Euclidean. To be precise, H = (R2N+1, ) is the space R2N+1 with the non-commutative law of product
   = x + x, y + y,  +   + 2(x · y - x · y) ,

for all  = (x, y,  ),  = (x, y,  )  RN × RN × R, where · denotes the

standard scalar product in RN . For more information on Heisenberg group,

see Section 2.

In this paper, we consider the quasilinear system of elliptic differential

inequalities

Hum1 + ||H1 |v|p  0, in , Hvm2 + ||H2 |u|q  0, in ,

(1.1)

where p > m2 > 0 and q > m1 > 0, ||H is defined as in (2.1), H is the sub-Laplacian on H (see Section 2), and  is an unbounded open subset of
Heisenberg group H taking one of the following three forms

(1). 1 := H; (2). 2 := {(x, y,  )  H | x1 > 0}; (3). 3 := {(x, y,  )  H |  > 0} .

In the past several decades, more and more attentions has been attracted to the analysis and PDEs on Heisenberg group, see [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 17, 22, 23]. Recall the celebrated results from Birindelli, Capuzzo Dolcetta and Cutr`i in [1], they investigated

Hu + ||Hup  0, in ,

(1.2)

and proved that

where

Q = 2N + 2,

and usually is called the homogeneous dimension of H. Later in [17], Pohozaev and V´eron removed the assumption of positiveness
of solution, and stuided

Hu + ||H|u|p  0, in H.

then

In the same paper [17], Pohozaev and V´eron also studied system of (1.1)

under the special case of m1 = m2 = 1,  = H, namely

Hu + ||H1 |v|p  0, in H, Hv + ||H2 |u|q  0, in H.

(1.4)

They proved that (1.4) admits no solution (u, v)  Lqloc(H, ||H2 d)×Lploc(H, ||H1 d) provided that 1, 2 > -2, and

Q  2 + min

2 + 1 p-1

,

2 + 2 q-1

,

for p > 1, q > 1.

Later, Hamidi and Kirane [4] showed that (1.4) admits no nontrivial solution,

if

Q  2 + max

2+ pq

One can easily check that when p > 1, q > 1,

Motivated by the above literature, we would like to generalize the study
in two respects: The first is that we aim to remove the positive assumption
of (u, v) to problem (1.1) with generalized m1, m2 > 0; the second is that we will study the nonexistence results in three different domains 1, 2, 3.
For our convenience, throughout the paper, let us denote

Theorem 1.2. When  = 2. If 1, 2 > -1, and Q   - ,

(1.6)

then (1.1) admits no nontrivial solution.

Theorem 1.3. When  = 3. If 1, 2 > 0, and Q   - 2,

(1.7)

then (1.1) admits no nontrivial solution.

Remark 1.4. Theorem 1.2 and 1.3 hold true respectively for any half-spaces taking the forms of
N
  H : aixi + biyi + d > 0, for (a, b)  RN × RN \ {0}, d  R ,
i=1
and
N
  H : aixi + biyi + ct + d > 0, for a, b  RN , c  R \ {0}, d  R .
i=1
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we prepare some preliminaries. In Section 3, we give the proof of Theorem 1.1 by applying three different test functions. Section 4 is devoted to the proof of Theorems 1.2-1.3.
Throughout the paper, we denote by c1, c2, · · · , C1, C2 · · · some positive constants, which may vary from line to line. And f h means that f  Ch for some constant C > 0.

2. Preliminaries

The sub-Laplacian H on H is defined, from the vector fields

Xi = xi + 2yi , Yi = yi - 2xi , (i = 1, · · ·N ), by

N

N

H =

Xi2 + Yi2 =

x2i + y2i + 4yix2i - 4xiy2i + 4(x2i + yi2)2 .

i=1

i=1

For a a function f : H  R, the horizontal gradient of f is defined as

N
Hf = (X1f, · · ·, XN f, Y1f, · · ·, YN f ) = [(Xif ) Xi + (Yif ) Yi] .
i=1

Let us define the norm of   H by

1
||H = |x|2 + |y|2 2 +  2 4 ,

(2.1)

which is homogeneous of degree 1 with respect to the dilations  : (x, y,  )  (x, y, 2 ) for  > 0. And Heisenberg distance between  and h on H is defined by
dH(, h) = -1  h H ,
where -1 = -.

Let us define the Heisenberg ball of radius R centered at  be the set

BH(, R) = {h  H : dH(, h) < R} ,

it follows that

|BH(, R)| = |BH(0, R)| = |BH(0, 1)| RQ,

where |BH(0, 1)| is the volume of the unit Heisenberg ball under Haar measure, which is equivalent to (2N + 1)-dimensional Lebesgue measure of R2N+1, and Q = 2N +2 is called the homogeneous dimension of H. For more details concerning the Heisenberg group, one can refer to books as [3, 11], survey papers as [5, 6, 10] and the references therein.
Define
Wl1o,cp() = u :   R | u, Hu  Lploc() ,
and let Wc1,p() be the subspace of Wl1o,cp() of functions with compact support.

Definition 2.1. A pair (u, v) is called a weak solution to system (1.1) if (u, v)  Wl1o,cq () × Wl1o,cp (), and the following inequalities

||H1 |v|pd  - Hum1 d,





(2.2)

and

||H2 |u|qd  - Hvm2 d,





are valid for any 0    Wc1,q ()  Wc1,p ().

Proof. Let i = fib, (i = 1, 2, 3),
where b > 1 is a large enough constant. Note that on Di,

i = 0,

and Hi = bfib-1H + bHfi = 0,

with

Hf1 = 0, Hf2 = x1 -1Hx1, Hf3 =  -1H,

and

Hx1 = (1, 0, · · ·, 0), H = 2(y, x).

Substituting  = i = fib into (2.2) and (2.3), we obtain

||H1 |v|pfibd  - um1 H fib d,

Note also that

and Hb = b(b - 1)b-2 |H|2 + bb-1H  bb-1H.

It follows that

H fib = fiHb + 2Hfi · Hb + bHfi

 bfib-1H + 2bb-1Hfi · H.

In what follows, we would like to use (3.1) with three different types of test

functions to prove (u, v)  (0, 0) in H, respectively.

· One is

() = (x, y,  ) := 

|x|4 + |y|4 +  2 R4

,

(3.2)

where   C[0, ) is a nonnegative function satisfying

(t) = 1 on [0, 1]; (t) = 0 on [2, ); ||  C < .

Set

r

=

|x|4+|y|4 R4

+

2

.

Note

that

supp (H)

is

a

subset

of

R =  = (x, y,  )  H | R4  |x|4 + |y|4 +  2  2R4 .

Direct calculation yields that

N

H =

x2i  + y2i  + 4yix2i  - 4xiy2i  + 4(x2i + yi2)2

i=1

= 16R-8(r) |x|6 + |y|6 +  2(|x|2 + |y|2) + 2 x · y(|x|2 - |y|2)

+ 4(4 + N )R-4(r)(|x|2 + |y|2).

Thus, It follows that

|H| R-2.

Note that I1  0 or J1  0 if and only if (1.5) holds. In the case I1  0, the integral I1, increasing in R, is bounded uniformly with respect to R. Applying the monotone convergence theorem, we conclude that ||H1 |v|p is in L1 (H). Note that instead of the first inequality of (3.5) we have, more
precisely,

which implies that v  0 in H and thus u  0 in H via (2.9). The proof in
the case J1  0 is analogous. · Another is

Inserting (3.17) into (3.1), we derive (3.5) once again. By substituting R for R, and arguing as we did as above, we can get the desired result.

Finally, using the dominated convergence theorem, we obtain

||H1 |v|px1 bd = 0.
2 R

Therefore,

lim

I2

=

0,

which implies that v  0 in 2 and thus u  0 in 2 via (2.9). The proof in the case J2  0 is analogous.

Proof of Theorem 1.3. When  = 3, we have for j = 1, 2,

K3,j =

1

||H(1-j )j   |H|j d

D3

and L3,j = 
Then (2.4) reads as

||H(1-j )j  -j |H |j |H|j d j .

We also use the first test function () defined by (3.2). By (3.3), we obtain

Note that I3  0 or J3  0 if and only if (1.7) holds. In the case I3  0, the integral I3, increasing in R, is bounded uniformly with respect to R. Applying the monotone convergence theorem, we conclude that ||H1 |v|p  is in L1 (3). Note that instead of the first inequality of (4.9) we have, more
precisely,

Finally, using the dominated convergence theorem, we obtain

Therefore,

which implies that v  0 in 3 and thus u  0 in 3 via (2.9). The proof in the case J3  0 is analogous.
