## Abstract

For homogeneous bilinear control systems, the control sets are characterized using a Lie algebra rank condition for the induced systems on projective space. This is based on a classical Diophantine approximation result. For affine control systems, the control sets around the equilibria for constant controls are characterized with particular attention to the question when the control sets are unbounded.
