## Abstract

Multi-scale structures are prevalent in both natural and artificial systems, as they can handle increasing complexity. Several terms are employed almost interchangeably across various application domains to refer to the multi-scale concept - e.g., hierarchy, holarchy, multi-level, multi-layer, nested, embedded, micro-macro or coarse graining. While the concrete meanings behind these terms may differ slightly, several core commonalities persist across all cases. In this position paper we aim to highlight these common features of the multi-scale concept, as a preliminary basis for a generic theory of multi-scale systems. We discuss the concepts of scale and multi-scale systems in general, and then of multi-scale feedback systems in particular, focusing on the role played by information in such systems. Our long-term objective is to develop a general theory of multi-scale feedback systems, applicable across all domains dealing with complex systems.
