## Abstract

Physical dynamic networks most commonly consist of interconnections of physical components that can be described by diffusive couplings. These diffusive couplings imply that the cause-effect relationships in the interconnections are symmetric and therefore physical dynamic networks can be represented by undirected graphs. This paper shows how (prediction error) identification methods developed for polynomial linear time-invariant systems can be configured to consistently identify the parameters and the interconnection structure of (undirected) physical networks. Further, a multi-step least squares (convex) optimization algorithm is developed to solve the nonconvex optimization problem that results from the identification method.
