## Abstract

We provide a sharp estimate for the asymptotic number of lattice zonotopes inscribed in $[0,n ]^d$ when $n$ tends to infinity. Our estimate refines the logarithmic equivalent established by Barany, Bureaux, and Lund when the sum of the generators of the zonotope is prescribed. Since a 2-dimensional zonotope is a centrally-symmetric polygon, this can also be considered a generalization to higher dimension of similar estimates that have been established for $2$-dimensional convex chains. As we shall see, the exponential part of our estimate is composed of a polynomial of degree $d$ in $n^{1/(d+1)}$, and involves Riemann's zeta function and depends on the Riemann hypothesis. Our analysis is based on a mapping between sums of coprime numbers and Eulerian polynomials. We also analyse some combinatorial properties of lattice zonotopes. In particular, we provide their average asymptotic diameter when $n$ goes to infinity.
