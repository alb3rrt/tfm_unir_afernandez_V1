ABSTRACT
The long-term variations of the orbit of the Earth govern the insolation on its surface and hence its climate. The use of the astronomical signal, whose imprint has been recovered in the geological records, has revolutionized the determination of the geological time scales (e.g. Gradstein & Ogg 2020). However, the orbital variations beyond 60 Myr cannot be reliably predicted because of the chaotic dynamics of the planetary orbits in the Solar System (Laskar 1989). Taking into account this dynamical uncertainty is necessary for a complete astronomical calibration of geological records. Our work addresses this problem with a statistical analysis of 120 000 orbital solutions of the secular model of the Solar System ranging from 500 Myr to 5 Gyr. We obtain the marginal probability density functions of the fundamental secular frequencies using kernel density estimation. The uncertainty of the density estimation is also obtained here in the form of confidence intervals determined by the moving block bootstrap method. The results of the secular model are shown to be in good agreement with those of the direct integrations of a comprehensive model of the Solar System. Application of our work is illustrated on two geological data: the Newark-Hartford records and the Libsack core.

1. Introduction
Milankovitch (1941) hypothesized that some of the past large changes of climate on the Earth originate from the long-term variations of its orbital and rotational elements. These variations are imprinted along the stratigraphic sequences of the sediments. Using their correlations with an orbital solution (Laskar et al. 2004, 2011a; Laskar 2020), some of the geological records can be dated with precision. This method, named astrochronology, has becomes a standard practice in the stratigraphic community, and proves to be a powerful tool to reconstruct the geological timescale (e.g Gradstein et al. 2004, 2012; Gradstein & Ogg 2020).
The climate rhythms found in the geological records are directly related to the Earth's precession constant and to the fundamental secular frequencies of the Solar System: the precession frequencies (gi)i=1,8 of the planet perihelia and the precession frequencies (si)i=1,8 of their ascending nodes. The evolution of these fundamental frequencies is accurately determined up to 60 Myr (Laskar et al. 2004, 2011a; Laskar 2020). Beyond this limit, even with the current highest precision ephemerides, it is hopeless to obtain a precise past history of the Solar System simply by numerical integration. This limit does not lie in the precision of determination of the initial conditions but originates in the chaotic nature of the Solar System (Laskar 1989, 1990; Laskar et al. 2011b). However, because the astronomical signal is recorded in the geological data, it appears to be possible to trace back the orbital variations in the geological record and thus to constrain the astronomical solutions beyond their predictability horizon (Olsen & Kent 1999; Ma et al. 2017; Olsen et al. 2019). Nevertheless, a deterministic view of the Solar System is no longer reliable beyond 60 Myr, and a statis-

tical approach should be adopted. Geological constraints likewise should be retrieved in a statistical setting. In this spirit, a recent Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach has been proposed to provide geological constraints on the fundamental frequencies (Meyers & Malinverno 2018). For such a Bayesian approach to give any meaningful constraint, proper prior distributions of the fundamental secular frequencies are required and therefore a statistical study of the orbital motion of the Solar System planets is needed. This constitutes the motivation for the present study.
Laskar (2008) performed the first statistical analysis of the long-term chaotic behavior of the planetary eccentricities and inclinations in the Solar System. Mogavero (2017) reconsidered the problem from the perspective of statistical mechanics. Our study is a follow-up of (Laskar 2008). We study fundamental frequencies instead of orbital elements because they are more robust and are closer to the proxies that can be traced in the geological records. This study is based on the numerical integrations of 120 000 different solutions of the averaged equations of the Solar System over 500 Myr, among which 40 000 solutions were integrated up to 5 Gyr. The initial conditions of the solutions are sampled closely around a reference value, that is compatible with our present knowledge of the planetary motion.
2. Dynamical model
2.1. Secular equations
We use the secular equations of motions of (Laskar 1985, 1990, 2008, and references therein). They are obtained by series expansion in planetary masses, eccentricities and inclinations, and through analytical averaging of second order over the rapidly-

changing mean longitudes of the planets. The expansion is trun-

cated at second order with respect to the masses and degree 5 in

eccentricities and inclinations. The equations include corrections

from general relativity and Earth-Moon gravitational interaction.

This leads to the following system of ordinary differential equa-

tions:

d dt

=

 -1{ + 3(, ¯ ) + 5(, ¯ )},

(1)

where  = (z1, . . . , z8, 1, . . . , 8) with zk = ek exp( k), k = sin(ik/2) exp(k). The variable k is the longitude of the perihelion, k is the longitude of the ascending node, ek is eccentricity and ik is inclination. 3(, ¯ ) and 5(, ¯ ) are the terms of degree 3 and 5. The 16 × 16 matrix  is the linear Laplace-

Lagrange system, which is slightly modified to make up for the

higher order terms in the outer Solar System. With adapted ini-

tial condition, the secular solution is very close to the solution

of direct integration over 35 Myr (Laskar et al. 2004). The major

advantage of the secular system over direct integration is speed.

Numerically integrating averaged equations is 2000 times faster

than non-averaged ones, due to the much larger step size: 250

years instead of 1.8265 days. It is thus desirable to employ the

secular equations to study the statistics of the Solar System. Yet,

we will also compare their predictions to those of a non-averaged

comprehensive dynamical model in Sect. 4.

2.2. Frequency Analysis

We employed the frequency analysis (FA) technique proposed

by Laskar (1988, 1993) to extract the fundamental secular fre-

quencies from the integrated solutions. The method find a quasi-

periodic approximation f (t) =

N k=1

ak eik t

of

a

function

f (t)

over a time span interval [0, T ]. It first finds the strongest mode,

which corresponding to the maximum of the function:

() = f (t)|eit = 1

T
(t) f (t)e-itdt,

(2)

T0

where (t) is a weight function which improves the preci-

sion of the maximum determination; it is chosen to be the Han-

ning window filter, that is (t) = 1 + cos(t/T ). The next step is

the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. The complex amplitude a1 of the first frequency 1 is calculated by orthogonal projection of function f (t) on ei1t. This mode is then subtracted from the function f (t) to get a new function f1(t) = f (t) - a1et. The process

is then repeated with this newly-obtained function until desired

N strongest modes are obtained. This technique works very well

for weakly-chaotic systems like the Solar System when variables

can be decomposed into quasi-periodic modes over a sufficiently

short period of time. It has been proven that this algorithm con-

verges towards the true frequencies much faster than the clas-

sical Fast Fourier Transform (Laskar 2005). Therefore, it is a

good tool to study the chaotic diffusion of the fundamental fre-

quencies. In this work, we used a routine naftab written in the

publicly-available computer algebra software TRIP (Gastineau

& Laskar 2011), developed at IMCCE, to apply directly the fre-

quency analysis.

To extract the fundamental secular frequencies of the So-

lar System, we apply the FA to the proper variables (z·i , i·)i=1,8 of the secular equations (Laskar 1990). Each fundamental fre-

quency is obtained as the frequency of the strongest Fourier com-

ponent of the corresponding proper variable. To track the time

evolution of the frequencies, the FA is applied with a moving in-

terval whose sliding step is 1 Myr. The interval sizes are 10 Myr,

20 Myr and 50 Myr.

3. Estimation of probability density functions
The samples of this study consist of the secular frequencies of the astronomical solutions which are obtained by integrating the secular equations (Eq. 1) from very close initial conditions. Due to this initial proximity, the correlation of the solutions in the samples lasts for a long period of time, but will eventually diminish. Our objective is to obtain a robust estimation of the marginal probability density functions (PDFs) from these correlated samples. In fact, this correlation is the main motivation for our use of the estimation methods in this section. Details of our samples are described in the first part of Sect. 4.
We use Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate the time-evolving marginal PDFs of the fundamental frequencies of the Solar System. In addition, the statistical uncertainty of our density estimations (i.e. PDF estimations) is measured by moving block bootstrap (MBB). To our knowledge, this application of MBB for KDE of a time-evolving sample, whose correlation changes overtime, is new. Therefore, in order to ensure the validity of the method, we have carried out several tests in Sect. 3.3.

3.1. Kernel Density Estimation

We chose KDE, also known as the Parzen­Rosenblatt window method, as our preferred non-parametric estimator of the PDFs of the fundamental frequencies of the Solar System because of its high convergence rate and its smoothing property (Rosenblatt 1956; Parzen 1962).
We briefly present the method here. Let X = {X1, X2, . . . , Xn} be a univariate independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sample drawn from an unknown distribution P with density function p(x). Then the KDE of the sample is defined as:

p^h(x|X)

=

1 nh

n i=1

K

x - Xi h

,

(3)

where K is a non-negative kernel function, and h is bandwith of the KDE. The choice of bandwidth h is much more important than the choice of kernel K, which is chosen to be the standard normal distribution in this paper. In this work we shall consider bandwidths of the following form:

BW = 0.9 min

^ ,

I QR 1.34

n-,

(4)

where ^ is the standard deviation of the sample, IQR is its interquartile range and  is a constant of choice. The bandwidth with  = 1/5 corresponds to the Silverman's rule of thumb (Silverman 1986). BW=1/5 is a slightly modified version of the optimal choice of bandwidth for Gaussian distributed data for better adaption to non-Gaussian data. Bias error and variance error of KDE with this bandwidth will be in the same order of magnitude. Undersmoothing, i.e choosing a smaller bandwidth, shrink the bias so that the total error is dominated by the variance error, which can then be estimated by bootstrap method (Hall et al. 1995); the common value of  for undersmoothing is 1/3.
When the sample is identically distributed but correlated, kernel density estimation is still valid under some mixing conditions (Robinson 1983; Hart 1996). Indeed, in case of observations that are not too highly correlated, the dependence among the data that fall in the support of the kernel function K can be actually much weaker than it is among the entire sample. This principle is known as whitening by windowing (Hart 1996). Therefore, the correlation in the sample does not invalidate the

employ of kernel density estimation, and only impacts the variability of the estimation (see Sect. 3.2). With regard to the choice of bandwidth, Hall et al. (1995) suggested that using the asymptotically optimal bandwidth for the independent data is still a good choice, even for some strongly dependent data sequences. The samples generated by a chaotic measure-preserving dynamical system (as in the case of the numerical integration of the Solar System) resembles those of mixing stochastic processes, hence the theory of KDE should also be applicable for dynamical systems, although the formulation might be different (Bosq & Guégan 1995; Maume-Deschamps 2006; Hang et al. 2018).
3.2. Moving Block Bootstrap

and its expectation E[p^k,l] = p^k(x|B1,l, . . . , Bn-l+1,l). Let's define

k,l(x) =

k h

( p^ k,l

-

E[ p^ k,l ]),

(5)

so that if h is chosen properly to reduce the bias to be asymp-
totically negligible with respect to the stochastic variation, then the MBB distribution P(k,l(x)|X) is a consistent estimator of the error distribution P((x)) when h  0, nh  , k  0, lk   and n/l  . Note that if l = 1, then k = h and MBB reverts to the undersmoothing procedure for i.i.d sample studied by Hall et al. (1995). The efficiency of this estimator depends sensitively on two tuning parameters l and k. We are interested in the un-
certainty of the KDE, which is characterised by the confidence
interval CI1-(x) and the confidence band CB1-, which are defined as:

Since the seminal paper by Efron (1979), bootstrap has become a standard resampling technique to evaluate the uncertainty of a statistical estimation. Bias and variance errors of KDE with the choice of bandwidth BW1/5 (Eq. 4) are in the same order of magnitude, hence one should either undersmooth, i.e. choose a smaller bandwidth, to minimize the bias (Hall 1995) or use an explicit bias correction with appropriate studentizing (Cheng et al. 2019; Calonico et al. 2018). However, applying naively the i.i.d. bootstrap procedure on dependent data could underestimate the true uncertainty, because all the dependence structure would be lost just by "scrambling" data together (Hart 1996). To remedy the problem, Kunsch (1989) and Liu et al. (1992) independently devised the moving block bootstrap (MBB), which later becomes standard practice to evaluate the uncertainty in dependent data (See Kreiss & Lahiri (2012) for a review). Although the MBB for smooth functional has been intensively studied, the literature on MBB for KDE of dependent data is very limited. Recently, Kuffner et al. (2019) has formulated an optimality theory of the block bootstrap for KDE under weak dependence assumption. They proposed both undersmoothing and explicit bias correction scheme to obtain the sampling distribution of the KDE. However, good tuning parameters, which are generally difficult to find if the data are from an unknown distribution, is required to provide a decent result. In this paper, we propose to overcome this problem with an inductive approach: the optimal tuning parameters obtained in a known model are tested on different models, and then extrapolated to our study - the Solar System.

P(|(x)| < CI1-(x)) = 1 - ,

(6)

P(|(x)| < CB1-x  ) = 1 - ,

(7)

where  denote the level of uncertainty; for example,  = 0.05 denotes 95% CI.
They can all be estimated by the MBB distribution P(k,l(x)|X) as:

P(|k,l(x)| < CI1-(x)) = 1 - ,

(8)

P(|k,l(x)| < CB1-x  ) = 1 - ,

(9)

In practice, we will also use CB and CI without the hat overhead
to denote the estimated value for short.
Our choice of the parameters of the MBB procedure l and k is based on the effective sample size neff, defined as (Kass et al. 1998):

neff = 1 + 2

n
 k=1

(k)

,

(10)

where (k) is the sample autocorrelation of lag k. The block length l is chosen by the sample correlation size lcorr as

l

n, neff

(11)

and the bootstrap bandwidth is parametrized as

Procedure of MBB We briefly describe the undersmooth
MBB for the kernel density estimation method (the detailed version can be found in (Kuffner et al. 2019)). Suppose X = {X1, X2, . . . , Xn} is a dependent sample of a mixing process with underlying density function p(x). The KDE of the sample is p^h = p^h(x|X); the hat overhead a given quantity denotes its estimated value. We use MBB to estimate the distribution of (x) = p^h(x) - p(x), where x  , and  is the domain of interest. Let l be an integer satisfying 1  l  n. Then Bi,l = {Xi, Xi+1, . . . , Xi+l-1} with i  {1, . . . , n - l + 1} denotes all the possible overlapping block of size l of the sample. Suppose l divides n for simplicity, then b = n/l. MBB samples
are obtained by selecting b blocks randomly with replacement from {B1,l, . . . , Bn-l+1,l}. Serial concatenation of b blocks will give n bootstrap observations: Xl = {B1,l, . . . , Bb,l}. By choosing l large enough (preferably larger than the correlation length),
MBB sample can retain the structure of the sample dependence. For k > 0, the KDE of the bootstrap sample is p^k,l = p^k(x|Xl )

k = h(c0 + (1 - c0)lc-orr),

(12)

where  and c0 are two optimizing constants. The reason for this choice of parametrization is two folds. First, when lcorr  1, the sample become independent, then k  h. Secondly, the rate of
change of k with respect to l should be greater when lcorr is small than when it is large. Therefore when lcorr 1, the optimal value of k should be quite stable. We also observe experimentally that
the optimal value of k is indeed relatively stable at around 2h as long as l = lcorr 1. So we simply choose  = 1 and c0 = 2. This choice of parameters turns out to be quite robust as it will
be demonstrated by the two numerical experiments in Sect. 3.3.
The literature on KDE and MBB focuses on stationary,
weakly dependent sequences. The data in our case, however, are different: they are not strictly stationary; the formulation of mixing condition might be different (Hang et al. 2018); the correlation in the sample is not constant but evolving with time; finally and most importantly, the data structure is different. Our sample units, which are the orbital solutions, are ordered based on their

initial distances in phase space. The solutions evolve over time but their order remains unchanged. Therefore statistical notions such as correlation and stationarity should be considered within this framework, for the sample at fixed values of time. Because of the differences presented, an optimality theory, which is not currently available, might be needed for this case. However, we assume it would not differ significantly from the orthodox analysis, and that a decent working MBB procedure could be obtained with some good choice of parameters. This will be tested in the section below.

3.3. Numerical experiments
We perform the KDE/MBB procedure on two numerical experiments to ensure its validity. The double Gaussian mixture model (DGMM) with different degrees of correlation is used to calibrate the algorithm of KDE/MBB method, that is to calibrate and test the tuning parameters (Eqs. 11-12). Then the resulting algorithm is applied on the Fermi Map as an example of a real dynamical system for assessment.

Double Gaussian Mixture Model The calibration of KDE/MBB was done on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sequences that sample a double Gaussian distribution. Our particular choice of the DGMM, inspired by Cheng et al. (2019), is

fDG(x) = 0.6(x) + 0.4(x - 4),

(13)

where (x) is the standard normal distribution. The MCMC sequence X1, . . . , Xn is obtained by the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm, with a Gaussian proposal distribution whose standard deviation p characterises the correlation length of the sequence (Metropolis et al. 1953; Hastings 1970). We can then either vary p or perform thinning to obtain a sequence of a desired correlation length. The size of each MCMC sequence is n = 104. The
initial state of the sequence is directly sampled from the distri-
bution fDG itself, so that burn-in is not necessary and the whole sequence is usable.

Fig. 2. Estimation of the confidence interval (90% CI) of KDEs from different samples with different correlation lengths. Solid lines are the
true values and the bands denote the distribution of MBB estimations (mean ± standard deviation), both are computed from 103 different samples, each composes of n = 104 units generated from the double Gaus-
sian mixture model by MCMC algorithm with the same lcorr.

On each MCMC sequence, we apply the KDE/MBB procedure with 500 MBB samples and the parameters specified above (Eqs. 11-12) with the undersmoothing bandwidth h = BW1/3, to get the uncertainty estimation (standard error, confidence in-
terval and confidence band). Figure 1 shows an example of the density estimation of a MCMC sequence of 104 units, with correlation length lcorr = 140; the sequence is generated by choosing p = 0.25. It is clear in the figure that the true PDF (in black) lies inside the range of the 90% CI estimated by MBB.
To assess the precision of the MBB uncertainty estimation, at each value of lcorr, we sample 1000 different MCMC sequences, and apply the KDE/MBB process on each of them to obtain their estimation of the confidence interval. We thus obtain a distri-
bution of confidence interval estimated by MBB, which are depicted by the bands of mean ± standard deviation (Fig. 2). With
the knowledge of the true PDF (Eq. 13), the true values of CI
and CB are obtained from this collection of KDEs at each corre-
lation length (Eqs. 6-7). Figure 2 compares the true values of the
pointwise 90% CI with the distribution of its estimated values by
MBB at various correlation lengths. We see that the 90% confi-
dence interval of KDE estimated by MBB is accurate across a
very wide range of lcorr, that is the true values almost always lie inside the estimation bands.

Fermi Map The second test for the MBB scheme is a 2dimensional chaotic Hamiltonian system: The Fermi map (Fermi 1949; Murray et al. 1985). This simple toy model, originally designed to model the movement of cosmic particles, describes the motion of a ball bouncing between two walls, one of which is fixed and the other oscillating sinusoidally. The equations of the Fermi map reads:

ut+1 = ut + sin ,

t+1

where ut and t are the normalized velocity of the ball and the

phase of the moving wall right before the tth collision, respec-
tively; the stochastic parameter of the system M is chosen here to be 104. The system is studied in the region of large-scale chaos. Our sample is obtained by evolving Eq. 14 from n = 103 initial conditions. The initial conditions u0, 0 are drawn from uniform distributions on [90 - 10-5, 90 + 10-5] and [0, 2], respectively; then they sorted by ascending value of 0. The sorting step is imperative to quantify the sample dependence as the initially-
ordered neighboring solutions still tend to be correlated after-
ward and the autocorrelation function can be calculated from or-
dered samples. Large initial phase variation will guarantee that chaotic diffusion will be immediately perceptible and the PDF of the velocity will center around its initial distribution. At each
time t, we compute the KDE of the sample with the bandwidth
BW1/3. The KDE uncertainty is estimated by applying the MBB 400 times with the same parameters specified above (Eqs. 1112). The whole process is then repeated 300 times with different sets of initial conditions. In the Fermi Map experiment, the
true analytical form of the density is not available, a numerical
"true" density, which is obtained by calculating the KDE with bandwidth BW1/5 from a n = 106 sample, is used instead to assess the validity of the MBB uncertainty estimation. From this
"true" density and the KDEs from 300 samples, we are able to
determine the true confidence band (Eq. 6-7).
Figure 3 shows an example of KDE and its confidence band estimated by MBB at t = 30. Although the estimated confidence band is valid, as the true curve lies completely in the band,
the KDE itself looks quite jagged. The jagged KDE is the result of the undersmooth bandwidth h = BW1/3 so the bias is dominated by the variance error. In fact, with the rule-of-thumb bandwidth h = BW1/5, we can have a smoother KDE (cf. bluedashed line of Fig. 3). This choice is valid because its uncertainty is always smaller than that estimated with h = BW1/3. Therefore we choose to use the uncertainty estimation computed with h = BW1/3 as an upper bound of the uncertainty of a KDE with the rule of thumb bandwidth. For example, a 95% CB of a KDE

with h = BW1/3 will represent an upper bound of a 95% CB of a KDE with h = BW1/5 (Fig. 4). The same also applies for the confidence interval.
Also from Fig. 4, we can see that the estimation of the confidence band follows well the true value. This is quite remarkable because, first we can extend the use of MBB to measure the uncertainty of density estimation from solutions of chaotic dynamical system, where the correlation of the sample defined by initial distances in phase space changes over time, and secondly, our simple choice of MBB parameters appears to work well across very different models.

3.4. Combining samples

After having obtained a well-tested uncertainty estimator of the

KDE for correlated data, we proceed with a practical ques-

tion: given several samples of different correlation length lcorr,

how can we efficiently combine them? Let's assume we have m

samples of the same size n: {X1m, X2m, . . . , Xnm}, where the

X1 = {X11, X21, . . . , Xn1}, . . . , Xm correlation within each sample

= is

different. The KDE of these m samples are p^1, . . . , p^m, and

their pointwise standard error can be estimated by MBB as

^ 1, . . . , ^ m.

If all the samples conform to the same probability density

p, we can simply use the inverse variance weighting to get our

combined KDE:

p^wa =

i

^ -i 2 p^i i ^ -i 2

,

(15)

where p^i and ^ 2i are the individual KDE and its pointwise estimated variance, respectively. The variance of the weigted average will be ^ 2wa = ( i ^ -i 2)-1. With this choice, the variance of the weighted average p^wa will be minimized and we can thereby
have the most accurate estimation of the density p (Hartung et al.

2011).

This inverse variance weighting is only applicable if we assume that all our samples follow the same underlying distribution, as for example in the double Gaussian mixture model. In the case of the Solar System, different samples come from different sets of initial conditions. The densities evolving from different initial conditions will be different. Although they might converge towards a common density function after a large period of time, the assumption that different samples follow the same distribution is not generally true. However, if the differences between the density estimations from different samples are small compared to their in-sample density uncertainty, then we can assume a common true density that all the sample share, and the inverse variance weighted mean and its minimized variance will in this case capture this assumed density function.
A more conservative approach consists in not trying to estimate the common true density, but rather capture the variability stemming from different samples and combine it with their in-sample uncertainty. In this case, a combined KDE may be introduced as a pointwise random variable, whose distribution function is given by:

m

p^c  m-1 P(p^i(x) - i (x)|Xi),

(16)

i=1

where i (x) is defined in Eq. (5) and P(p^i(x) - i (x)|Xi) is the MBB estimation of the distribution of the pointwise KDE from sample Xi. If the m samples are good representatives of any other sample taken from a certain population, then p^c is a reasonable choice for the KDE from an arbitrary sample generated from that
same population. We sample p^c in a pointwise manner. For each value of x, the same number of realizations are drawn from each
of the m MBB distributions, which are assumed here to be Gaus-
sian for practical purpose. It should be noticed that a realization
of p^c(x) is not a continuous curve. When needed, we can choose the pointwise median of p^c as the nominal continuous combined KDE.

4. Application to the Solar System
The goal of this paper is to have a consistent statistical description of the propagation of the dynamical uncertainty on the fundamental secular frequencies of the Solar System induced by its chaotic behavior; that is, simply put, to obtain their timeevolving marginal PDF. We first sample the initial orbital elements of the Solar System planets closely around the reference

value, then numerically integrate the secular equations (Eqs. 1) from those initial conditions to obtain a sample of orbital solutions. KDE is then used to estimate the marginal PDF of the frequencies of the sample at fixed value of time and then the MBB method is applied to estimate the uncertainty of the density estimation.
The evolution of our sample can be divided into two stages: Lyapunov divergence and chaotic diffusion. In the first stage, because the initial density is extremely localized around the reference value, all solutions essentially follow the reference trajectory, the difference between the solutions is very small but diverges exponentially with a characteristic Lyapunov exponent of  1/5 Myr-1 (Laskar 1989). The solutions in the first stage are almost indistinguishable and the correlation between them is so great that regardless of how many solutions in the sample we integrated, the effective size of the sample is close to one. The second stage begins when the differences between the solutions are large enough to become macroscopically visible. The Lyapunov divergence saturates and gives place to chaotic diffusion. The correlation between the solutions starts to decrease, the distribution of the sample settles and the memory of the initial conditions fades. It can take several hundreds of millions of years for the sample to forget its initial configuration. Contrary to the exponential growth in the first stage, the dispersion of the samples expands slowly with a power law in time (see Fig. 10). The time boundary between the two stages depends on the dispersion of the initial conditions, the wider they are, the faster the second stages come and vice versa. If they are chosen to represent the uncertainty of the current ephemeris, the second stage should take place around 60 Myr in the complete model of the Solar System (Laskar et al. 2011a,b).
In this section, we focus on the statistical description of the fundamental frequencies of the Solar System in the second stage. The aim is to have a valid estimation of time-evolving PDF of the frequencies beyond 60 Myrs. However, the PDF evolution generally depends on the choice of initial conditions. Moreover, the simplification of the secular equations compared to the complete model of the Solar System could, a priori, provide results which are not sufficiently accurate.
4.1. Choice of initial conditions
For a complete model of the Solar System, the initial conditions should be sampled in such a way that they are representative of the current planetary ephemeris uncertainty. Nevertheless, for a

simplified secular model (Eq. 1), the difference with the complete model is greater than the ephemeris uncertainty. An optimized secular solution follows the complete solution initially but will depart from it long before 60 Myr (Laskar et al. 2004). A direct adaptation of the current planetary ephemeris uncertainty into the initial conditions of the secular model can thus be misleading. Therefore, we adopt a more cautious approach, that is

to study first the effect of sampling the initial conditions on the PDF estimation.
Initial conditions can be sampled in many ways, especially in a high-dimensional system like the Solar System. Our choice of initial conditions is quite particular, but they encompass different possible ways of sampling initial conditions (Table 1). There are 3 batches: {Xi}, {Yi} and {Zi}, which corresponds to 3 different

Fig. 7. Density estimation with 95% pointwise confidence interval of the fundamental frequencies of the 12 sets coming from the 3 batches {Xi} (yellow colors), {Yi} (blue colors) an {Zi} (green colors) and from the 2 500 solutions of complete model of Laskar & Gastineau (2009) (red colors), which is denoted as La09. Estimations of sets from the same batch have the same color. Frequencies are obtained by FA over an interval of 20
Myr centering at 150 Myr (first and third rows) and 350 Myr (second and fourth rows) in the future. The time reference is the time of {Zi}, while the solutions of {Xi}, {Yi}, La09 are shifted 30 Myr, 20 Myr and -70 Myr respectively.

variation sizes of initial conditions. Each batch composes of 4 different sets of samples. Each set contains 10 000 initial conditions, where eccentricity of the associated planet is linearlyspaced from the reference value, with the spacing corresponding to the batch it belongs to. We then integrated the secular equations (Eqs. 1) from these initial conditions 500 Myr to the

past and 500 Myr to the future. For the batch {Zi}, the integration time is 5 billion years in both directions. The frequencies are then extracted using frequency analysis (section 2.2). It should be noted that we do not aim to obtain the joint probability distribution of all the fundamental frequencies, but rather their individual marginal PDFs, i.e. the PDF of one frequency at a time.

tegrations correspond to offsets of N in eccentricity of a single planet

for N = -5 × 103, . . . , +5 × 103, while other variables are kept to their

The marginal PDFs of the frequencies are estimated by the KDE with rule-of-thumb bandwidth (BW1/5), upper bounds of their 95% confidence intervals (denoted for short as 95% CI) are measured by the MBB method with the bandwidth h = BW1/3 and the optimized parameters (Eqs. 11-12) from 1 000 MBB samples.
We first compare the evolution of the density of the four sets in each batch in section 4.2. In section 4.3, the second test is performed to compare the statistics between the batches. Robustness of secular statistics will be assessed by these two tests, which will additionally shed light on the initial-conditiondependence aspect of the statistics. All the density estimations from these sets will then be compared with that of 2 500 complete solutions obtained in the previous work of (Laskar & Gastineau 2009), to test the accuracy of the secular statistics. It should be reminded that this numerical experiment needed 8 millions hours of CPU time, the output of which was saved and could thus be used in the present study.
When comparing two sets of different sizes, because the rates of divergence in the first stage are similar, the wider set reaches the chaotic diffusion phase faster than the more compact set, hence it is essentially diffusing ahead for a certain time in the second stage. Therefore, in order to have a relevant comparison, a proper time shift is introduced to compensate for this effect. We shift {Xi} and {Yi} ahead 30 Myr and 20 Myr respectively, while keeping the time of {Zi} as reference. This choice is motivated by the fact that the transition to the chaotic diffusion of {Zi} is around 50 - 60 Myr, which is indicated by direct integration of the Solar System (Laskar et al. 2011a,b).
4.2. First test: different samples of the same variation size
Comparing the density estimation of different sets in the same batch is the first test of prediction robustness from our secular model. The evolution of the density estimations will be sensitive to how initial conditions are sampled and therefore this initialcondition sensitivity must be quantified for a valid prediction. In the first test, we compare the time-evolving PDFs whose initial conditions are sampled with the same variation size but in different variables.
The result is quite clear. The different sets of the same batch slowly lose the memory of their initial differences due to chaos and then converge towards the same distribution. This convergence is illustrated by Fig. 5, which shows that the density estimation of (g)i=1,4 of the 4 sets of the batch {Zi} nearly overlap each other at 150 Myr in the future. The rates of convergence of different batches are different. So that although {Xi} and {Yi} exhibit the same behavior as {Zi}, they converge differently with disparate rates: At around 100-150 Myr in the future, the density estimations of the frequencies of {Xi} nearly overlap each other, this occurs at 150-200 Myr for {Yi}, depending on the frequency. Interestingly, for the samples that are integrated in the past, the

rates of convergence are higher, and the overlap generally happens at around -100 Myr (see Fig. 6).
4.3. Second test: different samples of different variation sizes
Comparing the density estimation of the 3 batches {Xi}, {Yi} and {Zi} is our second test of robustness. Although the initial conditions of the 3 batches are varied around the same reference values, the ways they are sampled are different from each other, since the variation sizes are different. Differences in the initial variation sizes mean that the batches will enter the diffusion stage at different times and also at different points in the phase space, so that the convergence between batches, if exists, would take longer. The result of our test is summarised by the density estimation of the frequencies at two times in the past, -100 Myr and -200 Myr (Fig. 6). At -100 Myr, the density estimations from different sets of each batch cluster around each other as described in the previous test. Each batch forms a cluster of density estimations and the differences between 3 clusters are noticeable. Moreover, the estimation uncertainty, depicted by the colored band, is quite large. Fast forward 100 Myrs of chaotic mixing, at -200 Myr, density estimations of the frequencies spread out, estimation uncertainty shrinks, and more importantly, differences between the 3 batches are much smaller, and they will continue to diminish even further as time goes. In the opposite time direction, the same phenomenon is observed but the rate of convergence between the batches is slower (Fig. 7). At 150 Myr in the future, the density estimation of frequencies of {Xi} and {Zi} has practically converged when those of {Yi} is still trying to, yet differences between 3 batches are noticeable. However, the estimations of all 12 sets from 3 batches nearly overlap each other at 350 Myr, which demonstrates that the effect of different initial samplings vanishes by chaotic mixing. It should be noted that when looking at some specific properties of the PDF such as means and variances, the differences between the sets are small. For example, the differences between the means of the PDF estimation of the 12 sets are generally smaller than 0.1 /yr for most of the fundamental frequencies at -100 Myr; at -200 Myr, the differences diminish to be twice as small.
4.4. Final test: comparison with the complete model
The convergence of the density estimations from different sets of initial conditions (seen in the first two tests) does not guarantee convergence between the secular model and the complete model of the Solar System. As a result, whether the secular statistics will resemble that of the complete model is still not clear. In this final test, we respond to this question by comparing the density estimation from our secular solutions with those obtained from the 2 500 solutions of the complete model integrated in the future (Laskar & Gastineau 2009). The initial conditions of the complete solutions are sampled in a way similar to the present work, that is one variable (the semi-major axis of Mercury) is linearly-spaced with a spacing of 0.38 mm and a range of about one meter. We shift the complete solution backward 70 Myrs to adjust for the difference in the initial variation sizes and also for the difference between the initial divergence rates.
The density estimations of the frequencies of the 2 500 complete solutions are shown along with the estimations from the secular model in Fig. 7. The estimations of the complete model are either close to or overlap those of the secular model even at 150 Myr. Both models even predict the same minor features in the frequency density, for example, the second peaks of g3 or the

tails of g4. The origins of these features are related to the resonances associating with g3 and g4, so having these same features indicates that the secular model could capture the resonance dynamics of the complete model. At 350 Myr, for most of the frequencies, the differences between the results of the two models are very small, especially for some frequencies like g1 where it is difficult to distinguish the two models. If we look at some specific properties of the PDF like its mean for example, the differences between the secular model and the complete model are at the same order with the variability of results from the same secular model. These differences of means of the PDFs are generally smaller than 0.05 /yr at 350 Myr. Although some minor differences between the two models are still visible, especially in s1 for example, these differences diminish as time goes. This convergence between the two models strongly suggests the compatibility of the secular system with the direct integration of the realistic model of the Solar System used in (Laskar & Gastineau 2009).
4.5. A complementary test on frequency analysis
The fundamental frequencies of the Solar System are central in our work, and the method to obtain them is thus essential. In this section, we briefly examine the frequency analysis method: FA (Sect. 2.2). FA searches a quasi-periodic approximation of the solution of the Solar System with constant frequencies over a time window t. So unique frequencies at time t are extracted from an oscillating sequence in the time interval [t - t/2, t + t/2]. For a quasi-periodic solution, the longer we choose the time interval t, the more accurate the extracted frequencies are. Nevertheless, the fundamental frequencies of the Solar System are expected to vary over a few Lyapunov times, that is 5 Myr. Therefore we have a trade-off between the extraction accuracy and time variation of the frequencies when choosing t: when t

is too large, the obtained frequency will tend to be the average of its variation over the same period. We chose t = 20 Myr as the standard FA interval. In some circumstances that requires detection of rapid changes in frequencies such as the resonance transition, a smaller t is more favorable (see section 6.3).
The extracted frequencies are sensitive to the choice of t, yet, their density estimation is relatively robust. Figure 8 compares the density estimation of the eccentricity frequencies (gi)1,4, which are extracted by FA with 3 different t at two different times. The differences are generally small but still notable for g2 and g4 at 150 Myr, and they will diminish as time goes.
5. Parametric fitting
From Sect. 4, we see that the long-term PDFs of the secular frequencies possess a distinct Gaussian-like shape that flattens as time passes. It is interesting to approximate these densities by a simple parametric model, so that its parameters can characterise the shape of the density and summarize its evolution. The model with its fitting parameters can also be used as an approximation of the numerical densities for later application. For this purpose, we will use the density estimation of the secular frequencies of the Solar System from the batch {Zi}, which composes of 40 000 different orbits over 5 Gyr. The inner fundamental frequencies (i.e. the frequencies of the inner planets (gi, si)i=1,4) are obtained by FA over an interval of 20 Myr. For the outer fundamental frequencies (i.e. the frequencies of the outer planets (gi)i=5,8, (si)i=6,8), the FA interval is 50 Myr. The frequency s5 is zero due the conservation of the total angular momentum of the Solar System.

5.1. Skew Gaussian mixture model
Laskar (2008) found that the 250 Myr-averaged marginal PDF of eccentricity and inclination of the inner Solar System planets are described quite accurately by the Rice distribution, which is essentially the distribution of the length of a 2D vector when its individual components follow independent Gaussian distributions. In in our case, the density estimations of the fundamental fre-

quencies of the Solar System resemble Gaussian distributions, but many of them get skewed as time passes, this is especially true for the inner frequencies. To account for this skewness, we propose the skew normal distribution as the fitting distribution to the density estimation of the frequencies:

emerge at the beginning of the diffusion stage and disappear quickly after. Therefore they are not included in this parametric model, whose aim is to fit the long-term PDF of the fundamental frequencies. However, some persist for a long time and have a small but non-negligible amplitude. To account for these secondary modes, we simply add Gaussian functions to the skew Gaussian distribution and adjust for their amplitudes so that the fitting distribution is ultimately the skew Gaussian mixture model:

Table 2. Linear and power law fits for the time evolution of the parameters (Fig. 10) of the skew Gaussian mixture model (Eq. 19) for the

fundamental frequencies of the Solar System. Col. 1 contains the considered secular frequencies. In col. 2, we show the linear fits of µ0 which represent the center of the distribution. The power law fit of 20 has the form 20(t) = aT b (Eq. 20), where T = t/(1 Gyr), a and b are given in col. 3 and col. 4 respectively. Linear fits of the skewness parameter 0 are given in col. 5. The last three columns show linear fits of the secondary mode of g4 and s3 (Eq. 19). The parameter 20 is fitted from 200 Myr to 5 Gyr in the past, while all the other ones are fitted from 500 Myr.

the asymptotic secondary modes for the other frequencies can

For the outer fundamental frequencies, we do not observe

significant skewness or secondary modes in their density esti-

mations. Therefore, the density estimations of the outer funda-

mental frequencies can be approximated by a simple Gaussian

distribution.

The density estimations of the frequencies are shown at 3

well separated times in Fig. 9. The diffusion is clearly visible as

the density estimations get more and more disperse over time.

Moreover, the density estimations get more skew as time goes.

For g3 and g4, the skewness of the density estimations is small, so we assume 0 = 0 (Eq. 17) for these frequencies for simplic-

ity. The fundamental frequencies of the outer planets are very

stable. Their variations are much smaller then those of the in-

ner frequencies. Taking as an example the most unstable outer

frequencies g6, its standard deviation at -4 Gyr is only about 2 · 10-3 /yr, while that of the most stable inner frequency g2

is 15 times larger. Therefore, when considering a combination

involving an inner fundamental frequency and an outer one, the

latter can be effectively regarded as a constant.

The result of our fitting model is also plotted in Fig. 9. It

is remarkable that the density estimations of the frequencies are

well approximated by the fitting curve over 3 different epochs.

It should be noticed that the base of our fitting model - the skew

Gaussian distribution only has 3 parameters. Only for some fre-

quencies, g4, s3 for examples, more parameters are needed. Nev-

ertheless, the additional parameters only account for the minor

features and 3 parameters are sufficient to represent the bulk of

the density estimations over a long time scale.

5.2. Evolution of the parameters
The parameters of our fitting models are extracted by the method of least squares, implemented by the routine curve_fit in the scipy package in Python. To retrieve the statistical distribution

(mean and standard deviation) of the parameters of a given model, we implement a bootstrap approach based on Eq. (16), with the assumption that pointwise standard errors of the KDE estimated by MBB are independent. We remark that, with such an assumption, the variance of the fitting parameters tends to be underestimated.
The time evolution of the mean of the parameters of the fitting models is shown in Fig. 10, along with their ±2 standard error, for both past and future. It turns out that the evolution of 20 is robustly fitted from 200 Myr to 5 Gyr in the past by a power law function

20(t) = a T b,

(20)

where T = t/(1 Gyr), as shown in Fig. 10. For all the other parameters, we perform a linear fit. All these fits are summarised
in Table 2. The differences between past and future evolutions are small
and generally tend to decrease with time. Therefore, the fit for
the parameters in the past given in Table 2 should also be repre-
sentative of their future evolution. In general, the parameters fol-
low relatively smooth curves with distinct tendencies. The skewness parameters 0, increasing in absolute value, show that the PDFs of the inner fundamental frequencies get more and more skew over time. The center of the distributions, indicated by µ0, does not change significantly compared to 0 and 20 (Fig. 10). The secondary modes of g4 and s3 are also quite stable.
The diffusion of the frequencies is quantified by the increasing 20, which is closely linked to their distribution variance. As the exponents b of the power laws in Table 2 are different from unity, the chaotic diffusion of the fundamental frequencies turns out to be an anomalous diffusion process. Interestingly, all the inner frequencies clearly undergo subdiffusion, that is the exponent of the power law b is smaller than 1 (b = 1 corresponding to Brownian diffusion). Therefore, an extrapolation of the variance of the inner frequencies based on the assumption of linear diffusion over a short time interval would generally lead to its overestimation over larger times. On the contrary, the exponents
b are either smaller or larger than unity for the outer frequen-
cies. It should be noted that, because the variations of the outer

6. Geological application
The aim of this project is to have a reliable statistical picture of the secular frequencies of the Solar System beyond 60 Myr. It is interesting to put recent geological results in this astronomical framework. First, this can be used as a geological test of our study, and secondly the application provides a glimpse of how astronomical data could be used in a cyclostratigraphy study. We first show how the uncertainty of a widely-used dating tool in astrochronology can be quantified, then we apply our work on two recent geological results, which are from the Newark-Hartford data (Olsen et al. 2019) and Libsack core (Ma et al. 2017).
6.1. Astronomical metronomes
Although it is not possible to recover the precise planetary orbital motion beyond 60 Myr, some astronomical forcing components are stable and prominent enough so that they can be used to calibrate geological records in the Mesozoic Era or beyond (see (Laskar 2020) for a review). The most widely-used is the 405kyr eccentricity cycle g2 - g5, which is the strongest component of the evolution of Earth's eccentricity. Recently the inclination cycle s3 - s6 has also been suggested for the time calibration of stratigraphic sequences (Boulila et al. 2018; Charbonnier et al. 2018). Although s3 - s6 is not the strongest among the obliquity cycles, it is quite isolated from other cycles and thus easy to be identified (Laskar 2020). The main reason that g2-g5 or possibly

s3 - s6 can be used as astronomical metronomes is their stability. Indeed, their uncertainty has to be small to be reliably used for practical application.
In previous work, the uncertainty of the frequency combination was derived from the analysis of a few solutions (Laskar et al. 2004, 2011a; Laskar 2020). Here we use a much larger number of solutions and the KDE/MBB method to derive both the PDF of the frequencies and their statistical errors. Starting from the results of all the sets of orbital solutions (Sect. 4), we produce the compound density estimation of the fundamental frequencies and their relevant combinations following the conservative approach in Eq. (16). These data are archived with the paper.
With this result, we can reliably estimate the uncertainty of the astronomical metronomes. The uncertainty of the cycles g2 - g5 and s3 - s6 is in fact the density width of the period of these frequency combinations, which is shown in Fig. 11. As time goes, the two metronomes get more uncertain as their density spreads due to the chaotic diffusion, but they are still reliable. At 400 Myr in the past, the relative standard deviations (ratio of standard deviation to mean) of g2 - g5 and s3 - s6 metronomes are approximately 0.4% and 1.26%, respectively.
6.2. Newark-Hartford data
In (Olsen et al. 2019), the astronomical frequencies were retrieved from a long and well-reserved lacustrine deposit. The frequency signals of the Neward-Hartford data are very similar to that of the astronomical solution La2010d, which was taken among 13 available astronomical solutions (Laskar et al. 2011a). Having 120 000 astronomical solutions at hand, we can

derive a more precise statistical analysis of this result. The fundamental frequencies from the geological record are obtained in the following way. The data were dated by the relatively stable 405-kyr cycle (g2 - g5) and additionally verified by a zircon U­Pb-based age model (Olsen et al. 2019). A frequency analysis (Sect. 2.2) was performed on the geological data as well as on the eccentricity of the astronomical solution La2010d to retrieve their strongest frequencies. The frequency analysis of geological data are cross-checked with that of astronomical solution to identify its orbital counterpart. For example, the third strongest frequency 12.989 /yr from Newark data is identified with the second strongest frequency 12.978 /yr from La2010d, which is g3 - g5. The frequency g3 is then derived by summing the obtained combination with g5, which is nearly constant. The same goes for g1, g2 and g4. Definite values of astronomical fundamental frequencies are thus determined. Unfortunately, the uncertainty estimation of the geological frequencies is yet not available.
Our density estimation of the frequencies is obtained by combining all our samples in a conservative approach specified in section 3.4. Figure 12 compares the secular frequencies (right)

and their combinations (left) extracted from NH data with our density estimation around the same time in the past. For (g)i=1,3, both the geological and La2010d lie relatively close to the main peak of their corresponding density while their values for g4 are near the tail. The frequency combinations tell the same story, as the geological values involving g4 are off from the main peak. Yet, they are all consistent with our density estimation as there is a non-negligible possibility of finding a secular solution that agrees with the geological data. It should be noted that certain frequencies are significantly correlated, g3 and g4 for example. We cannot assume that they are independent, therefore we have to calculate the density estimation of their combination directly.
Given the unavailability of the uncertainty in geological frequencies, the probability of finding the geological frequencies in a numerical orbital solution cannot be directly obtained. However, we can use La2010d, which is the solution from the complete model of the Solar System that matches the best with NH data, as the benchmark for our secular statistics. There are several criteria to determine how good a solution is, i.e. how well it could match with the geological data. A simple and rather straightforward criterion that we will use is  =

suited solution will have smaller  and vice versa. We found that

in the range from -200 Myr to -220 Myr, out of the 120 000 so-

lutions, there are around 5000 solutions (accounting for roughly

4.2% of the total number) having smaller s than that of La2010d

at -210 Myr, which is the value originally used to compared with

the geological data. It should be noted that La2010d is one of

13 available complete solutions. The 95% confidence interval of

the probability of obtaining such a good matching solutions from

the complete model of the Solar System is thus (1.37%, 33.31%) (Wilson 1927). Therefore, with the criterium , our result is statistically compatible with that of (Olsen et al. 2019).
6.3. Libsack core
Laskar (1990, 1992) presented several secular resonances to explain the origin of chaos in the Solar System. In particular, the argument of the resonance (s4 - s3) - 2(g4 - g3) is currently in a

librational state, that is

(s4 - s3) - 2(g4 - g3) = 0

(21)

and moves out to the rotational state around -50 Myr. The dynamics can even switch to the librational state of a new resonance:

(s4 - s3) - (g4 - g3) = 0.

(22)

This transition corresponds to a change from the 2:1 resonance to the 1:1 resonance of two secular terms g4 - g3 and s4 - s3. Because of this resonance, the
Ma et al. (2017) found a sudden change of the period of a
long cycle from 2.4 Myr to 1.2 Myr in the Libsack core of the Cretaceous basin from around -90 Myr to -83 Myr. This change
was also visible in La2004 astronomical solution, and the long cycle was attributed to frequency combination g4 - g3, visible from the spectrum of the eccentricity of the Earth. Although the
exact value before and especially after the transition is not clear,
the change of the period is visible from the band power of the
core (Fig. 1 of Ma et al. (2017)).
This change of g4 - g3 observed in the Libsack core corresponds to a transition from the resonance (s4 - s3) - 2(g4 - g3), which is the resonance that the Solar System is currently at, to the resonance (s4 - s3) - (g4 - g3). With a large number of astronomical solutions, we could understand better this phenomenon.
The transition is usually very fast: the frequency changes quickly
to another value and then reverts back also as quickly. Therefore,
to study the transition we use a smaller window for the frequency
analysis, 10 Myr instead of 20 Myr. Figure 13 shows the density estimation of g4 - g3 at 90 Myr as well as 300 Myr in the past. Both has a principle population in the range [0.4, 0.8] /yr, and a small but non-insignificant one centered around 1.0 /yr, which corresponds to the small chunk of g4 centered at 18.2 /yr. The transition observed is a sudden jump of frequency from the main population to the secondary one of g4, and therefore g4 - g3 as well.
The size of the secondary population is defined as the proportion of the solutions whose g4 - g3 > 0.9 /yr and denoted as P(g4 - g3 > 0.9 /yr). The rate of transition is defined as the proportion of the solutions whose g4 - g3 > 0.9 /yr over 10 Myr and denoted as P10Myr(g4 - g3 > 0.9 /yr). Both are shown in Fig 14. During the predictable period that is from now to -50 Myr, no transition is observed. After -50 Myr, a transition can
occur, its rate rises until 100 Myr, when the percentage of secondary population stay relatively stable at around 2.1% ± 0.5%
at a time, and the rate of the transition could also be determined to be 8% ± 1% every 10 Myr during this period. At 80-90 Myr,
when the transition was detected in the Libsack core, with our
numerical solutions, that rate of transition during this period is found to be 7.7% ± 4.5%.

7. Conclusion
In this work, we give a statistical description of the evolution of the fundamental frequencies of the Solar System beyond 60 Myr, that is beyond the predictability horizon of the planetary motion, with the aim to quantify the uncertainty induced by its chaotic behaviour. The base of our analysis is 120 000 orbital solutions of the secular model of the Solar System. The PDF of the frequencies is estimated by the kernel density estimator, its uncertainty evaluated by the moving block bootstrap; both methods are tested by numerical experiments.

We have benchmarked the secular model by sampling the initial conditions in different ways, then compare the density estimation of their solutions between themselves and finally with the complete model. The results are two folds. First, regardless of how initial conditions are sampled, their density estimation will converge towards a single PDF; after this overlap, a robust estimation is guaranteed. Secondly, the density estimation of the secular model is compatible with that of the complete model of the Solar System. This agreement means that results of the secular model, with superior computational simplicity, can be used for application on geological data.
We observe that the density estimations of the fundamental frequencies can be well fitted by skew Gaussian mixture models. The time evolution of the parameters 20, related to the frequency variances, follows power-law functions. Interestingly for the inner fundamental frequencies, the exponents of such power laws are all smaller than 1, which indicates that they undergo subdiffusion processes.
We show several examples of how this result can be used for geological applications. First, the uncertainty of any astronomical frequency signal is fully quantified, so that, for example, a proper quantitative response can be now made for the question of how stable are the astronomical metronomes. With this statistical framework, previous results from geological records beyond 60 Myr can also be interpreted with a more comprehensive approach. A more quantitative answer, not only about the possibility but also about the probability of occurrence of an astronomical signal in geological data can be made. Apart from these direct applications, a more systematic approach could fully make use of the density estimation of frequencies. The method TimeOpt by Meyers & Malinverno (2018), for example, shows that it is possible to combine both the uncertainty from astronomical signals and geological records to derive an effective constraint for both. In fact, any similar Bayesian method could use the density estimation of frequencies as proper priors.
