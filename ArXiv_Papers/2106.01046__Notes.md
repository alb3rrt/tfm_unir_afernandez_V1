## Abstract

In atomic physics, the Hund rule says that the largest spin and orbital state is realized due to the interplay of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the Coulomb interactions. Here, we show that in ferromagnetic solids the effective SOC and the orbital magnetic moment can be dramatically enhanced by a factor of $1/[1-(2U^\prime-U-J_H)\rho_0]$, where $U$ and $U^\prime$ are the on-site Coulomb interaction within the same oribtals and between different orbitals, respectively, $J_H$ is the Hund coupling, and $\rho_0$ is the average density of states. This factor is obtained by using the two-orbital as well as five-orbital Hubbard models with SOC. We also find that the spin polarization is more favorable than the orbital polarization, being consistent with experimental observations. This present work provides a fundamental basis for understanding the enhancements of SOC and orbital moment by Coulomb interactions in ferromagnets, which would have wide applications in spintronics.
