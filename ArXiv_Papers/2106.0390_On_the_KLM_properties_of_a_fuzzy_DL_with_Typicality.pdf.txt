Abstract. The paper investigates the properties of a fuzzy logic of typicality. The extension of fuzzy logic with a typicality operator was proposed in recent work to define a fuzzy multipreference semantics for Multilayer Perceptrons, by regarding the deep neural network as a conditional knowledge base. In this paper, we study its properties. First, a monotonic extension of a fuzzy ALC with typicality is considered (called ALCFT) and a reformulation the KLM properties of a preferential consequence relation for this logic is devised. Most of the properties are satisfied, depending on the reformulation and on the fuzzy combination functions considered. We then strengthen ALCFT with a closure construction by introducing a notion of faithful model of a weighted knowledge base, which generalizes the notion of coherent model of a conditional knowledge base previously introduced, and we study its properties.

1 Introduction
Preferential approaches have been used to provide axiomatic foundations of non-monotonic and common sense reasoning [21,43,44,39,45,40,3,36]. They have been extended to description logics (DLs), to deal with inheritance with exceptions in ontologies, by allowing for non-strict forms of inclusions, called typicality or defeasible inclusions, with different preferential semantics [31,13,32] and closure constructions [16,15,34,6,47,18,28].
In previous work [23], a concept-wise multipreference semantics for weighted knowledge bases has been proposed to account for preferences with respect to different concepts, by allowing, for a concept C, a set of typicality inclusions of the form T(C)  D (meaning "the typical C's are D's" or "normally C's are D's") with positive or negative weights. The concept-wise multipreference semantics has been first introduced as a semantics for ranked DL knowledge bases [24] and extended in [23] to weighted knowledge bases in the two-valued and fuzzy case, based on a different semantic closure construction, still in the spirit of Lehmann's lexicographic closure [40] and Kern-Isberner's c-interpretations [36,37], but exploiting multiple preferences associated to concepts. A related semantics with multiple preferences has been proposed in the first-order logic setting by Delgrande and Rantsaudis [22], and an extension of DLs with defeasible role quantifiers and defeasible role inclusions has been developed by Britz and Varzinczak [14,12], by associating multiple preferences to roles.

2
The concept-wise multipreference semantics has been proved to have some desired properties from the knowledge representation point of view in the two-valued case [24,25]. In particular, it satisfies the KLM postulates of a preferential consequence relation. The properties of entailment in a fuzzy DL with typicality have not been studied so far. In this paper, a monotonic extension of a fuzzy ALC with typicality is considered (called ALCFT) and the KLM properties of a preferential consequence relation are reformulated for this logic. Most of the postulates are satisfied, depending on the reformulation and on the chosen fuzzy combination functions.
The closure construction developed in [23] to define the models of a weighted defeasible knowledge base in the fuzzy case is reconsidered, by introducing a notion of faithful model of a weighted (fuzzy) knowledge base which is weaker than the notion of coherent fuzzy multipreference model in [23]. This allows to capture the larger class of monotone non-decreasing activation functions in multilayer perceptrons. The properties of faithful multipreference entailment are discussed.

2 The description logic ALC and fuzzy ALC

In this section we recall the syntax and semantics of the description logic ALC [1] and

of its fuzzy extension [42].

Let NC be a set of concept names, NR a set of role names and NI a set of individual names. The set of ALC concepts (or, simply, concepts) can be defined inductively:

- A  NC ,  and  are concepts; - if C and D are concepts, and r  NR, then C  D, C  D, ¬C, r.C, r.C are

concepts.

A knowledge base (KB) K is a pair (T , A), where T is a TBox and A is an ABox.

The TBox T is a set of concept inclusions (or subsumptions) C  D, where C, D are

concepts. The ABox A is a set of assertions of the form C(a) and r(a, b) where C is a

concept, a an individual name in NI and r a role name in NR. An ALC interpretation is defined as a pair I = , ·I where:  is a domain--a set

whose elements are denoted by x, y, z, . . . --and ·I is an extension function that maps

each concept name C  NC to a set CI  , each role name r  NR to a binary relation rI   × , and each individual name a  NI to an element aI  . It is

extended to complex concepts as follows:

I = , I = , (¬C)I = \CI ,

(r.C)I = {x   | y.(x, y)  rI and y  CI }, (r.C)I = {x   | y.(x, y)  rI  y  CI },

(C  D)I = CI  DI , (C  D)I = CI  DI .

The notion of satisfiability of a KB in an interpretation and the notion of entailment are

defined as follows:

Definition 1 (Satisfiability and entailment). Given an LC interpretation I = , ·I : - I satisfies an inclusion C  D if CI  DI ; - I satisfies an assertion C(a) (resp., r(a, b)) if aI  CI (resp., (aI , bI )  rI ).
Given a KB K = (T , A), an interpretation I satisfies T (resp. A) if I satisfies all
inclusions in T (resp. all assertions in A); I is a model of K if I satisfies T and A.
A subsumption F = C  D (resp., an assertion C(a), r(a, b)), is entailed by K, written K |= F , if for all models I = , ·I of K, I satisfies F .

3

Given a knowledge base K, the subsumption problem is the problem of deciding whether

an inclusion C  D is entailed by K.

Fuzzy description logics have been widely studied in the literature for representing

vagueness in DLs [49,48,42,8,4], based on the idea that concepts and roles can be inter-

preted as fuzzy sets. As in Mathematical Fuzzy Logic [20] a formula has a degree of

truth in an interpretation, rather than being either true or false, in a fuzzy DL axioms

are associated with a degree of truth (usually in the interval [0, 1]). In the following

we shortly recall the semantics of a fuzzy extension of ALC referring to the survey by

Lukasiewicz and Straccia [42]. We limit our consideration to a few features of a fuzzy

DL and, in particular, we omit considering datatypes.

A fuzzy interpretation for ALC is a pair I = , ·I where:  is a non-empty domain and ·I is fuzzy interpretation function that assigns to each concept name A 

NC a function AI :   [0, 1], to each role name r  NR a function rI :  ×   [0, 1], and to each individual name a  NI an element aI  . A domain element x   belongs to the extension of A to some degree in [0, 1], i.e., AI is a fuzzy set.

The interpretation function ·I is extended to complex concepts as follows:

I(x) = 1,

I (x) = 0,

(¬C)I (x) = CI (x),

(r.C)I (x) = supy rI (x, y)  CI (y), (C  D)I (x) = CI (x)  DI (x) (r.C)I (x) = infy rI (x, y)  CI (y), (C  D)I (x) = CI (x)  DI (x)
where x   and , ,  and  are arbitrary but fixed t-norm, s-norm, implication

function, and negation function, chosen among the combination functions of various

fuzzy logics (we refer to [42] for details). For instance, in both Zadeh and Go¨del logics

a  b = min{a, b}, a  b = max{a, b}. In Zadeh logic a  b = max{1 - a, b} and

a = 1 - a. In and Go¨del logic a  b = 1 if a  b and b otherwise; a = 1 if a = 0

and 0 otherwise.

The interpretation function ·I is also extended to non-fuzzy axioms (i.e., to strict

inclusions and assertions of an ALC knowledge base) as follows: (C  D)I = infxCI (x)DI (x), (C(a))I = CI (aI ), (R(a, b))I = RI (aI , bI ).
A fuzzy ALC knowledge base K is a pair (T , A) where T is a fuzzy TBox and A a

fuzzy ABox. A fuzzy TBox is a set of fuzzy concept inclusions of the form C  D  n,

where C  D is an ALC concept inclusion axiom,   {, , >, <} and n  [0, 1].

A fuzzy ABox A is a set of fuzzy assertions of the form C(a)n or r(a, b)n, where C

is an ALC concept, r  NR, a, b  NI ,   {, , >, <} and n  [0, 1]. Following

Bobillo and Straccia [4], we assume that fuzzy interpretations are witnessed, i.e., the sup

and inf are attained at some point of the involved domain. The notions of satisfiability

of a KB in a fuzzy interpretation and of entailment are defined in the natural way.

Definition 2 (Satisfiability and entailment for fuzzy KBs). A fuzzy interpretation I
satisfies a fuzzy ALC axiom E (denoted I |= E), as follows, for   {, , >, <}: - I satisfies a fuzzy ALC inclusion axiom C  D  n if (C  D)I  n; - I satisfies a fuzzy ALC assertion C(a)  n if CI (aI ) n; - I satisfies a fuzzy ALC assertion r(a, b)  n if rI (aI , bI ) n.
Given a fuzzy KB K = (T , A), a fuzzy interpretation I satisfies T (resp. A) if I satisfies all fuzzy inclusions in T (resp. all fuzzy assertions in A). A fuzzy interpretation I is a model of K if I satisfies T and A. A fuzzy axiom E is entailed by a fuzzy knowledge base K, written K |= E, if for all models I = , ·I of K, I satisfies E.

3 Fuzzy ALC with typicality: ALCFT

In this section, we extend fuzzy ALC with typicality concepts of the form T(C), for C a concept in fuzzy ALC. The idea is similar to the extension of ALC with typicality
[32], but transposed to the fuzzy case. The extension allows for the definition of fuzzy typicality inclusions of the form T(C)  D  n, meaning that typical C-elements are D-elements with a degree grater than n. A typicality inclusion T(C)  D, as in the two-valued case, stands for a KLM conditional implication C | D [39,40], but now it
has an associated degree. We call ALCFT the extension of fuzzy ALC with typicality. As in the two valued
case, such as in SROIQPT, a preferential extension of SROIQ with typicality [27],
or in the propositional typicality logic, PTL [7] the typicality concept may be allowed to
freely occur within inclusions and assertions, while the nesting of the typicality operator
is not allowed. We have to define the semantics of ALCFT. Observe that, in a fuzzy ALC inter-
pretation I = , ·I , the degree of membership CI (x) of the domain elements x in a concept C, induces a preference relation <C on , as follows:

x <C y iff CI (x) > CI (y)

(1)

Each <C has the properties of preference relations in KLM-style ranked interpretations [40], that is, <C is a modular and well-founded strict partial order. Let us recall that, <C is well-founded if there is no infinite descending chain x1 <C x0, x2 <C x1, x3 <C x2, . . . of domain elements; <C is modular if, for all x, y, z  , x <C y implies (x <C z or z <C y). Well-foundedness holds for the induced preference <C defined by condition (1) under the assumption that fuzzy interpretations are witnessed [4] (see section 2) or that  is finite. In the following, we will assume  to be finite.
While each preference relation <C has the properties of a preference relation in KLM rational interpretations [40] (also called ranked interpretations), here there are
multiple preferences and, therefore, fuzzy interpretations can be regarded as multiprefer-
ential interpretations, which have also been studied in the two-valued case [35,24,22,28].
Each preference relation <C captures the relative typicality of domain elements wrt concept C and may then be used to identify the typical C-elements. We will regard
typical C-elements as the domain elements x that are preferred with respect to relation <C among those such that CI (x) = 0.
Let C>I 0 be the crisp set containing all domain elements x such that CI (x) > 0, that is, C>I 0 = {x   | CI (x) > 0}. One can provide a (two-valued) interpretation of typicality concepts T(C) in a fuzzy interpretation I, by letting:

(T(C))I (x) =

1 0

if x  min<C (C>I 0) otherwise

(2)

where min<(S) = {u : u  S and z  S s.t. z < u}. When (T(C))I (x) = 1, we say that x is a typical C-element in I.
Note that, if CI (x) > 0 for some x  , min<C (C>I 0) is non-empty. This generalizes the property that, in the crisp case, CI =  implies (T(C))I = .

5
Proposition 1 (ALCFT interpretation). An ALCFT interpretation I = , ·I is fuzzy ALC interpretation, equipped with the valuation of typicality concepts given by condition (2) above.
The fuzzy interpretation I = , ·I implicitly defines a multipreference interpretation, where any concept C is associated to a preference relation <C . This is different from the two-valued multipreference semantics in [24], where only a subset of distinguished concepts have an associated preference, and a notion of global preference < is introduced to define the interpretation of the typicality concept T(C), for an arbitrary C. Here, we do not need to introduce a notion of global preference. The interpretation of any ALC concept C is defined compositionally from the interpretation of atomic concepts, and the preference relation <C associated to C is defined from CI .
The notions of satisfiability in ALCFT, model of an ALCFT knowledge base, and ALCFT entailment can be defined in a similar way as in fuzzy ALC (see Section 2). In particular, given an ALCFT knowledge base K, an inclusion T(C)  D n (with   {, , >, <} and n  [0, 1]) is entailed from K in ALCFT (written K |=ALCFT T(C)  D) if T(C)  D n is satisfied in all ALCFT models I of K. For instance, the fuzzy inclusion axiom T(C)  D  n is satisfied in a fuzzy interpretation I = , ·I if infx(T(C))I (x)  DI (x)  n holds, which can be evaluated based on the combination functions of some specific fuzzy logic.
4 KLM properties of ALCFT
In this section we aim at investigating the properties of typicality in ALCFT and, in particular, verifying whether the KLM postulates of a preferential consequence relation [39,40] are satisfied in ALCFT. The satisfiability of KLM postulates of rational or preferential consequence relations [39,40] has been studied for ALC with defeasible inclusions and typicality inclusions in the two-valued case [13,32]. The KLM postulates of a preferential consequence relation (i.e., reflexivity, left logical equivalence, right weakening, and, or, cautious monotonicity) can be reformulated for ALC with typicality, by considering that a typicality inclusion T(C)  D stands for a conditional C|D in KLM preferential logics, as follows:
(REFL) T(C)  C (LLE) If |= A  B and T(A)  C, then T(B)  C (RW) If |= C  D and T(A)  C, then T(A)  D (AND) If T(A)  C and T(A)  D, then T(A)  C  D (OR) If T(A)  C and T(B)  C, then T(A  B)  C (CM) If T(A)  D and T(A)  C, then T(A  D)  C
For ALC, |= A  B is interpreted as equivalence of concepts A and B in the underlying description logic ALC (i.e., AI = BI in all ALC interpretations I), while |= C  D is interpreted as validity of the inclusion C  D in ALC (i.e., AI  BI for all ALC interpretations I).
How can these postulates be reformulated in the fuzzy case? First, we can interpret |= C  D as the requirement that the fuzzy inclusion C  D  1 is valid in fuzzy

6

ALC (that is, C  D  1 is satisfied in all fuzzy ALC interpretations), and |= A  B as the requirement that the fuzzy inclusions C  D  1 and B  A  1 are valid in fuzzy ALC. For the typicality inclusions, we have some options. We might interpret an inclusion T(A)  C as the fuzzy inclusion T(A)  C  1, or as the fuzzy inclusion T(A)  C > 0.
The fuzzy inclusion axiom T(A)  C  1, is rather strong, as it requires that all typical A-elements belong to C with membership degree 1. On the other hand, T(A)  C > 0 is a weak condition, as it requires that all typical A-elements belong to C with some membership degree grater that 0. We will see that both options fail to satisfy one of the postulates. With the first option, the postulates can be reformulated as follows:
(REFL') T(C)  C  1 (LLE') If |= A  B and T(A)  C  1, then T(B)  C  1 (RW') If |= C  D and T(A)  C  1, then T(A)  D  1 (AND') If T(A)  C  1 and T(A)  D  1, then T(A)  C  D  1 (OR') If T(A)  C  1 and T(B)  C  1, then T(A  B)  C  1 (CM') If T(A)  D  1 and T(A)  C  1, then T(A  D)  C  1

We can prove that, in the well-known Zadeh logic and Go¨del logic, the postulates above, with the exception of reflexivity (REF L), are satisfied in all ALCFT interpretations.

Proposition 2. In Zadeh logic and in Go¨del logic any ALCFT interpretation I = , ·I satisfies postulates (LLE), (RW ), (AN D), (OR) and (CM )

Proof. Let I = , ·I be an ALCFT interpretation in Zadeh logic, or in Go¨del logic.
Let us prove, as an example, that I satisfies postulate (LLE'). -(LLE) Assume that axioms A  B  1, B  A  1 are valid in fuzzy ALC and
that T(A)  C  1 is satisfied in I. We prove that T(B)  C  1 is satisfied in I, that is (T(B)  C)I  1.
From the validity of A  B  1 and B  A  1, infxAI (x)  BI (x)  1 and infxBI (x)  AI (x)  1 in both Zadeh logic and in Go¨del logic. Hence,

for all x  , AI (x)  BI (x)  1 and BI (x)  AI (x)  1

(3)

In Go¨del logic, this implies that: for all x  , AI (x)  BI (x) and BI (x)  AI (x), i.e., AI (x) = BI (x). Therefore, the preference relations <A and <B must be the same and AI>0 = B>I 0. Hence, T(A)I (x) = T(B)I (x) for all x  , and from (T(A)  C)I  1, it follows that (T(B)  C)I  1, that is, T(B)  C  1 is
satisfied in I.
In Zadeh logic, (3) implies that, for all x  , max{1 - AI (x), BI (x)}  1 and max{1 - BI (x), AI (x)}  1 must hold, which implies that either AI (x) = BI (x) = 0 or AI (x) = BI (x) = 1. It follows that, for all x  , either (T(A))I (x) = (T(B))I (x) = 0 or (T(A))I (x) = (T(B))I (x) = 1. Hence, for all x  , it holds that (T(A))I (x) = (T(B))I (x), and from (T(A)  C)I  1, it follows that
T(B)  C  1 is satisfied in I.
For the other postulates that proof is similar and is omitted for lack of space. 

7
The meaning of the postulate (REFL') T(C)  C  1 is that the typical C-elements must have a degree of membership in C equal to 1, which may not be the case in an interpretation I, when there is no domain element x such that CI (x) = 1. Product and Lukasiewicz logics fail to satisfy postulates (REFL') and (OR'), but they can be proven to satisfy all the other postulates.
The following corollary is a consequence of Proposition 2.
Corollary 1. In Zadeh logic and in Go¨del logic, ALCFT entailment satisfies postulates (LLE), (RW ), (AN D), (OR) and (CM ).
For instance, for (AN D), if T(A)  C  1 and T(A)  D  1 are entailed from a knowledge base K in ALCFT, then they are satisfied in all the models I of K. Hence, by Proposition 2, T(A)  CD  1 is as well satisfied in all the ALCFT models of K, i.e., it is entailed by K. As reflexivity is not satisfied, the notion of ALCFT entailment does not define a preferential consequence relation, under the proposed formulation of the postulates.
Let us consider the alternative formulation of the postulates in the fuzzy case, obtained by interpreting the typicality inclusion T(A)  C as the fuzzy inclusion axiom T(A)  C > 0, that is:
(REFL") T(C)  C > 0 (LLE") If |= A  B and T(A)  C > 0, then T(B)  C > 0 (RW") If |= C  D and T(A)  C > 0, then T(A)  D > 0 (AND") If T(A)  C > 0 and T(A)  D > 0, then T(A)  C  D > 0 (OR") If T(A)  C > 0 and T(B)  C > 0, then T(A  B)  C > 0 (CM") If T(A)  D > 0 and T(A)  C > 0, then T(A  D)  C > 0
With this formulation of the postulates, it can be proven that in Zadeh logic and Go¨del logic all postulates except for Cumulativity (CM") are satisfied in all ALCFT interpretations. Under this formulation, reflexivity (REFL") is satisfied in all ALCFT interpretations I, as it requires that all typical C-elements in I have a degree of membership in C higher than 0, which holds from the definition of (T(C))I .
Proposition 3. In Zadeh logic and in Go¨del logic, any ALCFT interpretation I satisfies postulates (REFL"), (LLE"), (RW"), (AND") and (OR").
Cumulativity is too strong in the formulation (CM"). From the hypothesis that T(A)  D > 0 is entailed from K, we know that, in all ALCFT models I of K, the typical A-elements have some degree of membership n in D. However, the degree n may be small and not enough to conclude that typical A  D-elements are as well typical Aelements (which is needed to conclude that T(A  D)  C > 0 is satisfied in I, given that T(A)  C > 0 is satisfied in I). A weaker alternative formulation of Cumulativity can be obtained by strengthening the antecedent of (CM") as follows:
(CM) If T(A)  D  1 and T(A)  C > 0, then T(A  D)  C > 0
This postulate is satisfied by ALCFT entailment in Zadeh logic and Go¨del logic. We can then prove that:

8
Corollary 2. In Zadeh logic and in Go¨del logic, ALCFT entailment satisfies postulates (REFL"), (LLE"), (RW"), (AND"), (OR") and (CM).
As in the two valued case, the typicality operator T introduced in ALCFT is nonmonotonic in the following sense: for a given knowledge base K, from K |=ALCFT C  D  1 we cannot conclude that K |=ALCFT T(C)  T(D)  1. Nevertheless, the logic ALCFT is monotonic, that is, for two ALCFT knowledge bases K and K, if K  K, and K |=ALCFT E then K |=ALCFT E. ALCFT is a fuzzy relative of the monotonic logic ALC + T [32].
Although most of the postulates of a preferential consequence relation hold in ALCFT, this typicality extension of fuzzy ALC is rather weak, as it happens in the two-valued case with ALC + T and, similarly, with the defeasible extension of ALC in [13]. A monotonic logic, in particular, does not allow to deal with irrelevance. From the fact that birds normally fly, one would like to be able to conclude that normally yellow birds fly (being the color irrelevant to flying). But this conclusions is to be retracted when coming to know that normally yellow birds do not fly. Retracting conclusions in face of new evidence is not possible in a monotonic logic.
In the two-valued case, this has led to the definition of non-monotonic defeasible DLs [16,15,34,6,17,28], which exploit some closure construction (such as the rational closure [40] and the lexicographic closure [41]) or some notion of minimal entailment [5,33]. In the next section we strengthen ALCFT based on a closure construction similar to the one in [23], but exploiting a weaker notion of coherence, and we discuss its properties.
5 Strengthening ALCFT: a closure construction
To overcome the weakness of rational closure (as well as of preferential entailment), Lehmann has introduced the lexicographic closure of a conditional knowledge base [41] which strengthens the rational closure by allowing further inferences. From he semantic point of view, in the propositional case, a preference relation is defined on the set of propositional interpretations, so that the interpretations satisfying conditionals with higher rank are preferred to the interpretations satisfying conditionals with lower rank and, in case of contradictory defaults with the same rank, interpretations satisfying more defaults with that rank are preferred. The ranks of conditionals used by the lexicographic closure construction are those computed by the rational closure construction [40] and capture specificity: the higher is the rank, the more specific is the default. In other cases, the ranks may be part of the knowledge base specification, such as for ranked knowledge bases in Brewka's framework of basic preference descriptions [11], or might be learned from empirical data.
In this section, we consider weighted (fuzzy) knowledge bases, where typicality inclusions are associated to weights, and develop a (semantic) closure construction to strengthen ALCFT entailment, which leads to a generalization of the notion of fuzzy coherent multipreference model in [23]. The construction is related to the definition of Kern-Isberner's c-interpretations [36,37] which also include penalty points for falsified conditionals.

9
A weighted ALCFT knowledge base K, over a set C = {C1, . . . , Ck} of distinguished ALC concepts, is a tuple Tf , TC1, . . . , TCk , Af , where Tf is a set of fuzzy ALCFT inclusion axiom, Af is a set of fuzzy ALCFT assertions and TCi = {(dih, whi )} is a set of weighted typicality inclusions dih = T(Ci)  Di,h, where each inclusion dih has a weight whi , a real number. As in [23], the typicality operator is assumed to occur only on the left hand side of a weighted typicality inclusion, and we call distinguished concepts those concepts Ci occurring on the l.h.s. of some typicality inclusion T(Ci)  D. Arbitrary ALCFT inclusions and assertions may belong to Tf and Af .
Example 1. Consider the weighted knowledge base K = Tf , TBird, TP enguin, TCanary, Af , over the set of distinguished concepts C = {Bird , Penguin, Canary }, with empty ABox and with Tf containing the inclusions: Yellow  Black    1. Yellow  Red    1 Black  Red    1 The weighted TBox TBird contains the following weighted defeasible inclusions:
(d1) T(Bird )  Fly, +20 (d2) T(Bird )  has Wings., +50 (d3) T(Bird )  has Feather ., +50; TP enguin contains the defeasible inclusions: (d4) T(Penguin)  Bird , +100 (d5) T(Penguin)  Fly , - 70 (d6) T(Penguin)  Black , +50; and TCanary contains the defeasible inclusions: (d7) T(Canary)  Bird , +100 (d8) T(Canary)  Yellow , +30 (d9) T(Canary)  Red, +20. The meaning is that a bird normally has wings, has feathers and flies, but having wings and feather (both with weight 50) for a bird is more plausible than flying (weight 20), although flying is regarded as being plausible. For a penguin, flying is not plausible (inclusion (d5) has a negative weight -50), while being a bird and being black are plausible properties of prototypical penguins and (d4) and (d6) have a positive weight (100 and 50, respectively). Similar considerations can be done for concept Canary. Given Reddy who is red, has wings, has feather and flies (all with degree 1) and Opus who has wings and feather (with degree 1), is black with degree 0.8 and does not fly (FlyI (opus) = 0 ), considering the weights of defeasible inclusions, we may expect Reddy to be more typical than Opus as a bird, but less typical as a Penguin.
We define the semantics of a weighted knowledge base trough a semantic closure construction, similar in spirit to Lehmann's lexicographic closure [41], but more related to c-interpretations and, additionally, based on multiple preferences. The construction allows to select a subset of the ALCFT interpretations, the interpretations whose induced preference relations <Ci, for the distinguished concepts Ci, faithfully represent the defeasible part of the knowledge base K.
Let TCi = {(dih, whi )} be the set of weighted typicality inclusions dih = T(Ci)  Di,h associated to the distinguished concept Ci, and let I = , ·I be a fuzzy ALCFT interpretation. In the two-valued case, we would associate to each domain element x   and each distinguished concept Ci, a weight Wi(x) of x wrt Ci in I, by summing

10

the weights of the defeasible inclusions satisfied by x. However, as I is a fuzzy inter-
pretation, we not only distinguish between the typicality inclusions satisfied and those falsified by x. For all inclusion T(Ci)  Di,h  TCi, we need to consider the degree of membership of x in Di,h. Furthermore, in comparing the weight of domain elements with respect to <Ci, we give higher preference to the domain elements belonging to Ci with a degree grater than 0, with respect to those belonging to Ci with degree 0.
For each domain element x   and distinguished concept Ci, the weight Wi(x) of x wrt Ci in the ALCFT interpretation I = , ·I is defined as follows:

Wi(x) =

h whi DiI,h(x) -

if CiI (x) > 0 otherwise

(4)

where - is added at the bottom of all real values. The value of Wi(x) is - when x is not a C-element (i.e., CiI (x) = 0). Otherwise,
CiI (x) > 0 and the higher is the sum Wi(x), the more typical is the element x relative to concept Ci. How much x satisfies a typicality property T(Ci)  Di,h depends on the value of DiI,h(x)  [0, 1], which weighted by whi in the sum. In the two-valued case, DiI,h(x)  {0, 1}, and Wi(x) is the set of the weights of the typicality inclusions for C satisfied by x, if x is a C-element, and is -, otherwise.
Example 2. Let us consider again Example 1. Let I be an ALCFT interpretation such that FlyI (reddy) = (has Wings.)I (reddy) = (has Feather .)I (reddy) = 1 and Red I (reddy) = 1 , i.e., Reddy flies, has wings and feather and is red (and Black I (reddy) = 0). Suppose further that FlyI (opus) = 0 and (has Wings.)I (opus) = (has Feather .)I (opus) = 1 and Black I (opus) = 0 .8 , i.e., Opus does not fly, has wings
and feather, and is black with degree 0.8. Considering the weights of the typicality inclu-
sions for Bird , WBird (reddy) = 20 + 50 + 50 = 120 and WBird (opus) = 0 + 50 + 50 = 100. This suggests that reddy is more typical as a bird than opus.
On the other hand, if we suppose Bird I (reddy) = 1 and Bird I (opus) = 0.8, we have: WPenguin (reddy) = 100 - 70 + 0 = 30 and WPenguin (opus) = 0 .8 × 100 - 0 + 0 .8 × 50 = 120 . This suggests that reddy should be less typical as a penguin than
opus.

We have seen in Section 3 that each fuzzy interpretation I induces a preference
relation for each concept and, in particular, it induces a preference <Ci for each distinguished concept Ci. We further require that, if x <Ci y, then x must be more typical than y wrt Ci, that is, the weight Wi(x) of x wrt Ci should be higher than the weight Wi(y) of y wrt Ci (and x should satisfy more properties or more plausible properties of typical Ci-elements with respect to y). This leads to the following definition of a fuzzy multipreference model of a weighted a ALCFT knowledge base.

Definition 3 (Faithful (fuzzy) multipreference model of K). Let K = Tf , TC1, . . . , TCk , Af be a weighted ALCFT knowledge base over C = {C1, . . . , Ck}. A faithful
(fuzzy) multipreference model (fm-model) of K is a fuzzy ALCFT interpretation I = , ·I s.t.:

­ I satisfies the fuzzy inclusions in Tf and the fuzzy assertions in Af ;

11

­ for all Ci  C, the preference <Ci is faithful to TCi, that is:

x <Ci y  Wi(x) > Wi(y)

(5)

Let us consider again Example 2.

Example 3. Referring to Example 2 above, where Bird I (reddy) = 1 , Bird I (opus) = 0.8, let us further assume that PenguinI (reddy) = 0 .2 and PenguinI (opus) = 0 .8 .
Clearly, reddy <bird opus and opus <P enguin reddy. For the interpretation I to be faithful, it is necessary that the conditions WBird (reddy) > WBird (opus) and that WBird (reddy) > WBird (opus) hold. This is true, as we have seen from Example 2. On the contrary, if it were PenguinI (reddy) = 0 .9 , the interpretation I would not be
faithful.

Notice that, requiring that the converse of condition (5) also holds, gives the equivalence x <Ci y iff Wi(x) > Wi(y), a stronger condition which would make the notion of faithful multipreference model of K above coincide with the notion of coherent fuzzy multipreference model of K introduced in [23]. Here, we have considered the weaker notion of faithfulness and a larger class of fuzzy multipreference models of a weighted knowledge base, compared to the class of coherent models. This allows a larger class of monotone non-decreasing activation functions in neural network models to be captured (for space limitation, for this result, we refer to [26], Sec. 7).
The notion of faithful multipreference entailment (fm-entailment) from a weighted ALCFT knowledge base K can be defined in the obvious way.
Definition 4 (fm-entailment). A fuzzy axiom E is fm-entailed from a fuzzy weighted knowledge base K (K |=fm E) if, for all fm-models I = , ·I of K, I satisfies E.
From Proposition 3, the next corollary follows as a simple consequence.

Corollary 3. In Zadeh logic and in Go¨del logic, fm-entailment satisfies postulates (REFL"), (LLE"), (RW"), (AND"), (OR") and (CM).

To conclude the paper let us infomally describe how fuzzy multipreference entailment deals with irrelevance and avoids inheritance blocking, properties which have been considered as desiderata for preferential logics of defeasible reasoning [50,37].
For irrelevance, we have already considered an example: if typical birds fly, we would like to conclude that of typical yellow birds fly, as the property of being yellow is irrelevant with respect to flying. Observe, that in Example 2, we can conclude that Reddy is more typical than Opus as a bird (reddy <Bird Opus), as Opus does not fly, while Reddy flies. The relative typicality of Reddy and Opus wrt Bird does not depend on the their color, and we would obtain the same relative preferences if reddy were yellow rather than red. A formal proof of the irrelevance property would require that the domain  to be large enough to contain some typical bird which is yellow, requiring, as usual in the two valued case [34], a restriction to some canonical models.
The fuzzy multipreference entailment is not subject to it to the problem called by Pearl the "blockage of property inheritance" problem [46], and by Benferhat et al. the "drowning problem" [3]. This problem affects rational closure and system Z [46], as

12
well as rational closure refinements. Roughly speaking, the problem is that property inheritance from classes to subclasses is not guaranteed. If a subclass is exceptional with respect to a superclass for a given property, it does not inherit from that superclass any other property. For instance, referring to the typicality inclusions in Example 2, in the rational closure, typical penguins would not inherit the property of typical birds of having wings, being exceptional to birds concerning flying. On the contrary, in fuzzy multipreference models, considering again Example 2, the degree of membership of a domain element x in concept Bird , i.e., Bird I (x ), is used to determine the weight of x wrt Penguin (as the weight of typicality inclusion (d4) is positive. The higher is the value of Bird I (x ), the higher the value of WPenguin (x ). Hence, provided the relevant properties of penguins (such as non-flying) remain unaltered, the more typical is x as a bird, the more typical is x as a Penguin. Notice that the weight WBird (x ) of a domain element x wrt Bird is related to the interpretation of Bird in I by the faithfulness condition.
6 Conclusions
In this paper we have studied the properties of an extension of fuzzy ALC with typicality, ALCFT. We have considered some alternative reformulation of the KLM postulates of a preferential consequence relation for ALCFT, showing that most of these postulates are satisfied, depending on the formulation considered and on the fuzzy logic combination functions. We have considered a (semantic) closure construction to strengthen ALCFT, by defining a notion of faithful (fuzzy) multipreference model of a weighted knowledge base. Faithful models of a conditional (weighted) knowledge base are a more general class of models with respect to the coherent fuzzy multipreference models considered in [23] to provide a semantic interpretation of multilayer perceptrons. This allows to capture the larger class of monotone non-decreasing activation functions in multilayer perceptrons (a result which is not included in the paper due to space limitations and for which we refer to [26]). The paper studies the KLM properties of faithful multipreference entailment and discusses how the multipreference approach allows to deal with irrelevance and avoids inheritance blocking.
The strong relationship between the fuzzy extension of the multipreference semantics for weighted KBs and multilayer perceptrons [23], allows a deep neural network to be regarded as a conditional knowledge base, where neurons correspond to concepts and synaptic weights corresponds to the weights of conditionals. Conversely, a conditional KB (with typicality inclusions T(Ci)  Cj and Ci, Cj atomic) can be regarded as a deep network, and its weights can be learned from empirical data. This possibility of combining empirical knowledge and symbolic knowledge in the form of DL axioms motivates the study of the properties of this multipreference extension of a fuzzy DLs.
Undecidability results for fuzzy description logics with general inclusion axioms [2,19,9] have motivated restricting the logics to finitely valued semantics [10], and also motivate the investigation of decidable approximations of fm-entailment. Another issue is whether the multipreference semantics can provide a semantic interpretation of other neural network models, besides multilayer perceptrons and self-organising maps [38], whose multipreference semantics has been investigated in [29,30].
