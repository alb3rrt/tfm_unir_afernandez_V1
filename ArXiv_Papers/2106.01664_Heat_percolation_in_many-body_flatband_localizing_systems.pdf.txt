Translationally invariant finetuned single-particle lattice Hamiltonians host flat bands only. Suitable short-range many-body interactions result in complete suppression of particle transport due to local constraints and Many-Body Flatband Localization. Heat can still flow between spatially locked charges. We show that heat transport is forbidden in dimension one. In higher dimensions heat transport can be unlocked by tuning filling fractions across a percolation transition for suitable lattice geometries. Transport in percolation clusters is additionally affected by effective bulk disorder and edge scattering induced by the local constraints, which work in favor of arresting the heat flow. We discuss explicit examples in one and two dimensions.

Introduction -- The breaking of ergodicity in interacting quantum many-body systems, known as many-body localization (MBL), is an important open problem and active topic of research. The first studies [1≠5] showed that MBL and the exponential suppression of any transport arise in one-dimensional interacting systems from the interplay of random fields and interactions. While the original MBL framework has been widely developed both theoretically and experimentally [6, 7], the need for random fields as a key element for MBL has been later relaxed as MBL features have been found in a variety of systems without disorder [8≠13] ≠ particularly, in interacting systems featuring an extensive number of local constrains [14≠19]. Computationally, interacting quantum systems face an exponential divergence in complexity over the system size, which limits most of numerical efforts to 1D. This, and the lack of analytically treatable models and methods, renders the crucial quest for MBL in higher-dimensional networks particularly challenging. Indeed, while signatures of MBL in 2D systems have been reported [20, 21], it has also been shown that in D > 1 the MBL regime is possibly unstable and destabilised in the long time limit [22].
In this Letter, we study the transport features of disorder-free many-body systems which are based on Hamiltonian networks completely lacking single-particle dispersion. In particular, we relate the existence of phase transitions between conducting and insulating regimes to the lattice profile and its dimensionality. In translationally invariant lattices, the lack of single-particle dispersion in e.g. one Bloch band typically results in a macroscopically degenerate set of eigenstates, all spatially compact (CLS) [23≠25]. Hence, a complete lack of dispersion ≠ i.e. all Bloch bands are flat (ABF) [26≠28] ≠ results in the absence of extended states and strict singleparticle confinement in the network. Flatband networks are increasingly permeating the quantum many-body field. Indeed, single-particle CLS have been extended to many-body CLS [29≠31], while quantum scars [32≠ 34] and MBL-like dynamics [35≠37] have been reported

very recently in flatband lattices. But more importantly, it has been shown that fine-tuning of the interaction in ABF networks induces an extensive set of local constraints which completely suppress charge transport in any spatial dimension ≠ a phenomenon called many-body flatband localization (MBFBL) [38≠40]. We focus on MBFBL networks, and by recasting them into a sitepercolation problem we show that the structure of the Hilbert space undergoes a percolation transition upon tuning the filling fraction. Percolation approaches have been formerly employed to study MBL phenomena ≠ e.g. Refs. [41≠43], and more recently [19]. One of our main findings is that the critical value depends only on the lattice geometry and dimensionality, but not on particular realizations of the Hamiltonian terms ≠ thus indicating universality. More specifically, such transitions are absent and any transport is suppressed in all 1D networks, whereas in D  2 the presence of the transition depends on the MBFBL geometry ≠ highlighting high-dimensional many-body systems where transport vanishes at any filling fraction. Additionally, we found that in the conducting phases predicted by percolation, the local constraints hurdle and potentially stop transport by generating effective bulk and edge disorders.
Setup -- We study interacting many-body systems whose Hamiltonians consist of D-dimensional networks with  strictly flat energy bands equipped with fine-tuned two-body interactions. Without loss of generality we consider spinless fermions, and following the scheme outlined in Ref. [38] we consider a set of Hamiltonians written as

boring unit cells might still exchange energy locally via the interaction H^int [44]. However the local heat ex-

change vanishes if at least one of the two cells coupled by H^int is either empty or full, i.e. I^l = {0, }. Consequently

unit cells of Eq. (1) split according to their occupation number into blocking (empty/full cell, I^l = {0, }) or conducting (all the other cases, I^l = {0, }) The impact

of blocking cells on the global heat transport in Eq. (1)

depends on the network geometry encoded by l1, l2 , its

spatial dimension D, the number of single particle flat-

bands , and the filling fraction .

One-dimensional case -- In 1D MBFBL networks (1),

a single blocking unit cell acts as a bottleneck, strictly

disconnecting left and right parts of a given state of the

Hilbert space and completely removing any global heat transport. Consequently, subspaces labelled by {I^l} are

separated into (i) conducting channels where every unit

cell is conducting (hence, there exists a continuous path

along heat-exchanging units which connect opposite ends

of the system), and (ii) non-conducting states where at

least one unit cell is blocking. Within a non-conducting

state, blocking cells separate contiguous conducting unit

cells, conducting islands, where heat transport is pos-

sible although non-global. The existence of conducting

channels ≠ and the possibility of heat transport ≠ in 1D

networks (1) is controlled by the filling fraction . For

1/    ( - 1)/ conducting and non-conducting

channels coexist, otherwise only non-conducting states

are present.

The  = 2 case is the minimal testbed setup. In this

case, conducting channels are only present at precisely filling fraction  = 0.5 (I^l = 1 in all cells). An exam-

Higher dimensions -- Unlike the one-dimensional case, a single blocking unit cell does not completely halt global transport in D  2. Thus, a subspace is a conducting channel if there is at least one path formed by conducting cells connecting opposite sites of the network. Otherwise, a subspace is non-conducting. For finite system sizes conducting channels exist only in a limited range of filling fractions , which converges to the full

We start with the simplest case and consider a D = 2 Hamiltonian H^ (1) arranged as a square lattice. In Fig. 3 we schematically illustrate conducting channels (a) and states from non-conducting subspace (b). The site-percolation critical value in this network is pcr  0.59 [54]. In Fig. 3(c) we show the numerically computed percolation probability as a function of the filling fraction  for several system sizes L and number of sites per unit cell . The inset of Fig. 3(c) compares the percolation probabilities calculated from the Bernoulli percolation model and from the direct sampling of the fermionic Hilbert space. The results are in excellent agreement justifying the application of the Bernoulli model. For  = 2 the probability that a unit cell is conducting is p  0.5 for any , with the maximum p = 0.5 being reached at  = 0.5 ≠ hence, the transition value pcr  0.59 is never

4
reached, the network never undergoes percolation transition and global transport is suppressed for all filling fractions . Numerical simulations confirm this conclusion for  = 2. For  = 3, 4 numerical simulations give clear evidences of a percolation transition upon varying , again in excellent agreement with the critical values predicted by Eq. (5).
In D = 2 the majority of lattices ≠ kagome, honeycomb, octagon ≠ have critical values pcr 0.5 [55]. Exceptions include networks with further than nearestneighbor terms [56], chimera [57], and triangular lattice [58]. Hence, in two dimensions, most of  = 2 MBFBL networks H^ avoid percolation transition (and therefore any transport is absent) since the maximum probability of a unit cell to be conducting is p = 0.5. As D increases, the critical transition pcr in a given class of lattices typically decreases: for example D  3 hypercubic networks H^ percolation transition occurs for any   2 [53]. However, exotic networks on which H^ avoid percolation transition exist: for instance,  = 2 MBFBL networks on 3D cubic-oxide or 3D silicon-dioxide [59, 60].
Geometric percolation theory yields regions of filling fraction where the number of states from conducting channels is dominating over those from the nonconducting ones. However, quantum transport in these regions can still be hindered due to several additional factors, that become clear once mappings to spin models, that generalize the D = 1 case are considered. These factors follow from the local constraints {I^l}. Firstly, as discussed for the spin mapping within the conducting subspace in D = 1, distributions of particles in the conducting cells can generate disorder in the interactions, the local spin fields (for   3), and even the spin lengths (for   4). Secondly, percolating clusters in conducting channels have in general a highly irregular fractal structure [61], yielding edge scattering. This source of scattering ≠ already present in classical percolation ≠ is in our context further amplified by the inhomogeneous arrangements of blocking cells in the network. This yields additional, effectively random fields in the spin model in the conducting cells at the edges of the percolating cluster. Finally, let us point out that the existence of dead-end bonds which fully reflect waves and lead to an effective increase of the percolation threshold with respect to the classical one ≠ a phenomenon called quantum percolation [62, 63] ≠ has been demonstrated for single-particle quantum percolation clusters. Thus, the classical values of critical probability pcr discussed above could only be a lower bound on the effective quantum threshold values for the MBFBL networks.
Conclusions and Perspectives -- In this work we studied transport features of translationally invariant interacting many-body flatband (MBFBL) networks [38≠40]. While charges are strictly confined in these models due to local constraints, heat is in principle allowed to flow along conducting channels ≠ leading to site-percolation

transitions in the networks. We found that in 1D the number of conducting channels either vanishes or decays exponentially with the system size, hence suppressing any transport. In higher dimensions, the number of conducting channels can undergo a percolation transition upon tuning the filling fraction , potentially triggering heat transport. However, the presence of the transition depends on the network type, the number of single-particle energy bands , and the dimensionality D. While we explicitly verified this conclusions for the case of spinless fermions, these results hold for any type of many-body statistics.
Our analysis ≠ rooted in geometric percolation theory, alongside recent findings of localization/delocalization transition in 2D quantum link models [19] ≠ overcomes the complexity typical of D  2 many-body systems which render their computational analysis impractical nowadays. Importantly, we highlight classes of disorderfree many-body systems in two and higher spatial dimensions where any type of transport is completely suppressed for any filling fraction . Even in those networks that feature conducting phases, quantum transport is hurdled and potentially halted by effective disorder and edge effects resulting from the local constraints. Exploring these quantum effects and investigating the distinction between classical and quantum percolation transitions [62, 63] are crucial future developments, which may have important repercussions for the research in the field of quantum transport. These results and open quests emphasize MBFBL networks as experimentally realizable [64≠66] valid platforms to explore novel phenomena in quantum systems ≠ highlighting jointly with Refs. [29≠ 40] the progressively growing relevance of flatbands in the realm of many-body physics.

[44] Let us observe that if H0 in Eq. (1) is diagonal, then every

particle number operator n^l,a for any l and a is conserved

≠ hence fully suppressing heat transport as well.

[47] In Eq. (3) we neglected the constant energy shift terms

which do not impact the dynamics of the system.

[48] For a conducting island with 1  l  M conducting

cells, the boundary terms in Eq. (3) read

(I^0 - 1)^1z +

(1 - I^M+1)^M z , where I^0, I^M+1 are the particles number

operators in unit cells l = 0, M + 1.
