## Abstract

The first goal of this paper is to formalize the problem of designing a transaction fee mechanism, taking into account the many idiosyncrasies of the blockchain setting (ranging from off-chain collusion between miners and users to the ease of money-burning). The second goal is to situate the specific mechanism proposed in EIP-1559 in this framework and rigorously interrogate its game-theoretic properties. The third goal is to suggest competing designs that offer alternative sets of trade-offs. The final goal is to highlight research opportunities for the EC community that could help shape the future of blockchain transaction fee mechanisms.
