## Abstract

We present a spherical version of the theorem of Blaschke that every body of constant width $w < \frac{\pi}{2}$ can be approximated as well as we wish in the sense of the Hausdorff distance by a body of constant width $w$ whose boundary consists only of pieces of circles of radius $w$. This is a special case of our theorem about approximation of spherical reduced bodies.
