ON DIGRAPHS WITH POLYGONAL RESTRICTED NUMERICAL RANGE
THOMAS R. CAMERON, H. TRACY HALL, BEN SMALL§, AND ALEXANDER WIEDEMANN¶
Abstract. In 2020, Cameron et al. introduced the restricted numerical range of a digraph (directed graph) as a tool for characterizing digraphs and studying their algebraic connectivity. In particular, digraphs with a restricted numerical range of a single point, a horizontal line segment, and a vertical line segment were characterized as k-imploding stars, directed joins of bidirectional digraphs, and regular tournaments, respectively. In this article, we extend these results by investigating digraphs whose restricted numerical range is a convex polygon in the complex plane. We provide computational methods for identifying these polygonal digraphs and show that these digraphs can be broken into three disjoint classes: normal, restricted-normal, and pseudo-normal digraphs, all of which are closed under the digraph complement. We prove sufficient conditions for normal digraphs and show that the directed join of two normal digraphs results in a restricted-normal digraph. Also, we prove that directed joins are the only restricted-normal digraphs when the order is square-free or twice a square-free number. Finally, we provide methods to construct restricted-normal digraphs that are not directed joins for all orders that are neither square-free nor twice a square-free number.

1. Introduction. Let G denote the set of finite simple unweighted digraphs. For
each   G, we have  = (V, E), where V is the vertex set, E  V × V is the edge
set, and (i, j)  E if and only if i = j and there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j.
The order of  is equal to |V |; when |V | = 0, we refer to  as the null digraph. Given   G of order n, we denote the out-degree of the vertex i  V by d+(i),
which is equal to the number of edges of the form (i, j)  E. Similarly, we denote the in-degree of the vertex i  V by d-(i), which is equal to the number of edges of
the form (j, i)  E. After indexing the vertex set as V = {1, 2, . . . , n}, we define the Laplacian matrix of  by L = [lij ]ni,j=1, where

lij =

d+(i) -aij

if i = j if i = j

and A = [aij]ni,j=1 is the adjacency matrix of , that is, aij = 1 if (i, j)  E and aij = 0 otherwise. We use subscript notation to indicate the particular digraph when it is unclear from the surrounding context, for example, d+ (i) denotes the out-degree of vertex i in digraph .
In general, the numerical range (or field of values) of a complex matrix A  Cn×n
is defined as follows [10, 16]:

W (A) = {xAx : x  Cn, x = 1} ,

where · denotes the Euclidean norm on complex vectors. For our purposes, we are interested in the restricted numerical range of the Laplacian matrix, which we define by
Wr(L) = {xLx : x  Cn, x  e, x = 1} ,
where e is the all ones vector of dimension n. Clearly Wr(L) =  when n = 1. If the dimension is unclear from context, we use the notation en. When convenient, we may refer to Wr(L) as the restricted numerical range of a digraph, and mix the notation Wr(L) with Wr().
The definition of the restricted numerical range is motivated by its close connection to the algebraic connectivity for digraphs as defined in [14]. Indeed, let   G have order n and let L be the Laplacian matrix of . Then, the algebraic connectivity of  is defined by
() = min xT Lx,
xS
where S = {x  Rn : x  e, x = 1} .
Another related and useful quantity is
() = max xT Lx.
xS
We summarize this connection and other basic properties below. Note thate we define a restrictor matrix of order n as an n × (n - 1) orthonormal matrix whose columns are orthogonal to e. If n = 1, then the restrictor matrix is an empty matrix, that is, a matrix where the number of columns is zero. Also, we use  to denote the complement digraph of , that is, the digraph whose edge set consists exactly of those directed edges not in .
Proposition 1.1. Let   G have order n and let L be the Laplacian matrix of . Also, let Q be a restrictor matrix of order n. Then, the following properties hold.
(i) The restricted numerical range satisfies Wr(L) = W (QLQ). (ii) The set Wr(L) is invariant under re-ordering of the vertices of . (iii) The eigenvalues of L are contained in Wr(L), except (possibly) for the zero
eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector e. (iv) The minimum real part of Wr(L) is equal to () and the maximum real part
of Wr(L) is equal to (). (v) Let L denote the Laplacian matrix of the complement digraph. Then, Wr(L) =
n - Wr(L).
Proof. For (i)­(iv), see [2, Proposition 2.1]. For (v), note that L = nI - eeT -L. Therefore,
Wr(L) = W (QLQ) = W (nI - QLQ) = n - W (QLQ),
by [10, 16, Theorem 4].
Next, we summarize the known characterizations of digraphs using the restricted numerical range. Note that the directed join of digraphs  = (V, E) and  = (V , E), where V  V  = , is defined by
    = (V  V , E  E  {(i, j) : i  V, j  V }) ,
and En and Kn denote the empty and complete digraph of order n, respectively.

Theorem 1.2. Let   G have order n and let L be the Laplacian matrix of . Then, the following characterizations hold:
(i)  is a dicycle (directed cycle) of order n if and only if Wr(L) is a complex polygon with vertices
1 - ei2j/n : j = 1, . . . , n - 1 ,

where i denotes the imaginary unit. (ii)  is a k-imploding star, that is,  = En-k   Kk for some k  {0, 1, . . . , n}, if
and only if Wr(L) is a single point. Moreover, the numerical value of this point is k. (iii)  is a regular tournament if and only if Wr(L) is a vertical line segment. Moreover, n is odd and this vertical line segment has real part n/2. (iv)  is a directed join of two bidirectional digraphs, where one may be the null digraph, if and only if Wr(L) is a horizontal line segment. Moreover, this line segment lies on the non-negative portion of the real axis.
Proof. For (i), see [2, Theorem 2.6]; for (ii), see [2, Theorem 3.2]; for (iii), see [2, Theorem 3.3 and Corollary 3.4]; for (iv), see [2, Theorem 4.2 and Theorem 4.3].
Note that parts (ii)­(iv) of Theorem 1.2 completely describe all digraphs with a restricted numerical range as a degenerate polygon, that is, a point or a line segment in the complex plane. In this article, we extend these results to include digraphs whose restricted numerical range is a non-degenerate convex polygon in the complex plane. Throughout, we refer to digraphs whose restricted numerical range is a degenerate or non-degenerate convex polygon in the complex plane as polygonal.
Partial motivation for studying polygonal digraphs comes from their application to synchronization theory. Indeed, consider the parameter µ(L), which is defined as the supremum of the set of real numbers µ such that U (L - µI) + (LT - µI)U is positive semi-definite for some irreducible symmetric zero sum matrix U with nonpositive off-diagonal entries. In [15], it is shown that µ(L) is a measure of how well the topology of the associated coupled network is amenable to synchronization. In particular, the larger µ(L) is, the easier it is to synchronize the network. The following proposition extends the result in [15, Theorem 4]. Note that (·) denotes the multi-set of eigenvalues for a given square complex matrix.
Proposition 1.3. Let   G have order n and let L be the Laplacian matrix of . If  is polygonal, then () = µ(L).
Proof. By [15, Theorem 2 and Theorem 3], it follows that

()  µ(L)  min Re () ,
(Q LQ)

where Q is a restrictor matrix of order n. Since  is polygonal, Wr(L) is a convex polygon whose vertices, by Proposition 1.1 (i) and [10, 16, Theorem 13], are eigenvalues of QLQ. Therefore,
() = min Re () .
(Q LQ)

In [1], the value

min Re ()
(Q LQ)

is called the generalized algebraic connectivity of  and it is shown that this value reflects the expected asymptotic convergence rate of cooperative consensus-based al-

gorithms in an asymmetric network represented by . Hence, our investigation of

4

polygonal digraphs will help identify networks for which the algebraic connectivity (), the generalized algebraic connectivity from [1], and the synchronization parameter µ(L) from [15] are equal.
In addition, our study of polygonal digraphs will help identify digraphs for which the algebraic connectivity satisfies () = 0 if and only if  has multiple terminal strongly connected components, see Proposition 1.4. Ideally, this result would hold for all digraphs since () is a generalization of Fiedler's algebraic connectivity for undirected graphs [3] and the number of terminal strongly connected components in a digraph is equal to the algebraic (and geometric) multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue of the corresponding Laplacian matrix [12]. However, as illustrated by Figure 1, this result is not in general true for all digraphs. Indeed, Figure 1 shows a digraph that has only one terminal strongly connected component, yet its algebraic connectivity is zero. Note that the digraph is shown on the left with the restricted numerical range on the right, and the eigenvalues of QLQ are displayed using the star symbol. The digraph vertices are not labeled since, by Proposition 1.1, the restricted numerical range is invariant under re-ordering of the vertices.
Note that given any  = (V, E)  G we can partition the vertices as V = V1  V2  · · ·  Vk, where for each i = 1, . . . , k, the subdigraph induced by Vi is strongly connected, that is, there exists a directed path between all pairs of vertices in Vi. Also, we say that the subdigraph induced by Vi is terminal provided that for all u  Vi and v  Vj, where i = j, the edge (u, v) does not exist in E.
Proposition 1.4. Let   G have order n be polygonal. Then, () = 0 if and only if  has multiple terminal strongly connected components.
Proof. As noted in the proof of Proposition 1.3, since  is polygonal, Wr(L) is a convex polygon whose vertices are eigenvalues of QLQ, which are also eigenvalues of L. Moreover, by Gersgorin's circle theorem (see for example [7]), the eigenvalues of L are contained in the disk centered at maxiV d+(i) with radius maxiV d+(i). Hence, L cannot have purely imaginary eigenvalues, and it follows that 0 is the minimum real part of Wr(L) if and only if the origin of the complex plane is a corner of Wr(L). Therefore, Proposition 1.1 (iv) and [10, 16, Theorem 13] imply that () = 0 if and only if 0 is an eigenvalue of QLQ, that is, 0 is an eigenvalue of L with multiplicity greater than 1.

Before proceeding, note that our definitions for algebraic connectivity, restricted numerical range, and polygonal digraphs, along with our results from Proposition 1.1 (i)­(iv), Proposition 1.3, and Proposition 1.4 hold for finite simple digraphs with positive weights. Although, in this article, we focus on unweighted digraphs.

2. Computing Polygonal Digraphs. Let   G have order n and let L be the Laplacian matrix of . By Proposition 1.1, the restricted numerical range of  can be computed as the numerical range of QLQ, where Q is a restrictor matrix of order n. The computation of the numerical range of a general complex matrix B is well-established in the literature and relies on the fact that since W (B) is convex, as proved by Toeplitz and Hausdorff [5, 13], the boundary of W (B) can be approximated by convex polygons determined by supporting lines of W (B) [9, 10, 16]. Note that a supporting line of a curve is a line that contains a point on the curve but does not separate any two points on the curve.

2.1. Supporting Lines Check. Using Johnson's algorithm [9], we compute the restricted numerical range of a digraph   G by setting B = QLQ, where L is the Laplacian matrix of  and Q is a restrictor matrix of order n. Once Wr(L) is computed we can determine if  is polygonal by checking whether Wr(L) is equal to the convex hull of the eigenvalues of B, which we denote by conv ((B)). In general, given a finite set S contained in a real or complex vector space, the convex hull conv (S) is
the set of all convex combinations of elements from S. Alternatively, conv (S) can be
characterized as the intersection of all convex sets containing S, so it is the smallest closed convex set containing S [6].
If we are only interested in whether W (B) = conv ((B)), for a given B  Cn×n, then we need not compute the numerical range W (B). Indeed, since conv ((B)) 
W (B), it suffices to check that every edge of conv ((B)) is a supporting line of
W (B). To this end, let v1, . . . , vk denote the vertices of conv ((A)) ordered in the counter-clockwise direction. Then, for each j  {1, . . . , k}, define the direction

dj

=

vj+1 |vj+1

- vj - vj|

and note that the jth edge of conv ((B)) can be written as

vj vj+1 = {vj + tdj : 0  t  |vj+1 - vj |} ,

where it is assumed that vk+1 = v1. For each j  {1, . . . , k}, let j  [0, 2) be such that

(2.1)

eij = i · dj ,

and define v^j = eij vj
as the vertices of the rotated convex hull conv  eij B . Based on how j is defined, it is clear that the jth edge of this rotated convex hull,

v^j v^j+1 = eij vj + teij dj : 0  t  |vj+1 - vj | ,

can be formed from the edge vjvj+1 by first rotating it to the real axis (pointing in the positive direction) and then rotating 90 degrees in the counter-clockwise direction.
Hence, the edge v^jv^j+1 is a vertical line segment whose real part is equal to the maximum real part of conv  eij B . If the edge v^jv^j+1 is also a supporting line of W (eij B), then it follows that Re eij vj must equal the maximum real part of W (eij B), which is well-known (see for example [9]) to equal the maximum real eigenvalue of the Hermitian part of the matrix eij B.
Since W (B) = conv ((B)) if and only if W (eiB) = conv  eiB , for all  
[0, 2), the above discussion leads to an efficient algorithm for determining if a digraph   G is polygonal. Indeed, see Algorithm 2.1, noting that H(B) = (B + B) /2 is
the Hermitian part of the matrix B.

2.2. Survey of Polygonal Digraphs. Using the Nauty software [11], we are able to generate all non-isomorphic digraphs of order n. For each digraph , we can use Algorithm 2.1 to determine if  is polygonal. We can further speed up this process by noting that Proposition 1.1(v) implies that Wr(L) is a complex polygon if and only if Wr(L) is a complex polygon. Hence, to generate the set of polygonal digraphs, we only need to search through (about) half of the non-isomorphic digraphs of order n and then add complements as necessary. Code that implements this process in Python and C is available at https://github.com/trcameron/polygonal-digraphs. After running this code, we identified 3, 9, 29, 97, 395, 2185, and 18930 polygonal digraphs on 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 vertices, respectively.
Furthermore, the polygonal digraphs can be split into three classes. In class 1, the Laplacian matrix is normal; we refer to these as normal digraphs. It is worth noting that [2, Lemma 2.5] implies that if L is normal then QLQ is normal for any restrictor matrix Q of order n. In class 2, the Laplacian matrix is not normal but QLQ is normal; we refer to these as restricted-normal digraphs. Finally, in class 3, neither the Laplacian matrix nor QLQ is normal but Wr(L) is still a complex polygon; we refer to these as pseudo-normal digraphs. Figure 2 provides an example from each class.
In Table 1, the number of polygonal digraphs in each class is shown for orders n = 2, . . . , 8. Not surprisingly, there are no pseudo-normal digraphs until n  6. Indeed, if W (B) = conv ((B)) for some n × n complex matrix B, where n  4, then it is known that B must be normal [8]. Since QLQ is a square matrix of size one less than the size of L, the above observation follows immediately.
We conclude this section with Proposition 2.1, which shows that not only are polygonal digraphs, in general, closed under the digraph complement, but the individual classes are also closed under the digraph complement.
Proposition 2.1. Let normal, restricted-normal, and pseudo-normal digraphs be referred to as class 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Also, let   G have order n. Then,  is

in class c  {1, 2, 3} if and only if its complement  is in class c.
Proof. Let  and  be complementary digraphs of order n with Laplacian matrices L and L, respectively. Note that
L = nI - eeT - L.
Clearly e is an eigenvector of both L and L corresponding to the zero eigenvalue. Furthermore, for any v that is orthogonal to e, the eigenvalue-eigenvector equation Lv = v holds if and only if Lv = (n - ) v holds. Therefore, by Grone [4, Condition 14], L is normal if and only if L is normal, which implies that  is normal if and only if  is normal.
Now, let Q be a restrictor matrix of order n. Then,
QLQ = nI - QLQ.
Hence, QLQ is normal if and only if QLQ is normal, which implies that  is restricted-normal if and only if  is restricted-normal.
Finally, by Proposition 1.1(v), it follows that Wr(L) is a complex polygon if and only if Wr L is a complex polygon. Therefore,  is pseudo-normal if and only if  is pseudo-normal.

3. Analyzing Polygonal Digraphs. In this section, we analyze the structure of polygonal digraphs from the normal and restricted-normal classes. In particular, we prove sufficient conditions for normal digraphs and show that the directed join of two normal digraphs results in a restricted-normal digraph. Also, we prove that directed joins are the only restricted-normal digraphs when the order is square-free or twice a square-free number. Finally, we provide a construction for restricted-normal digraphs that are not directed joins for all orders that are neither square-free nor twice a square-free number.
3.1. Normal Digraphs. It is easy enough to construct a normal digraph. For instance, any dicycle will suffice as illustrated in Figure 2; more generally, any digraph whose Laplacian is a circulant matrix, possibly after re-ordering the vertices, will also suffice. Consider, for example, the digraph in Figure 3 whose plane embedding has 60 rotational symmetry. Given a certain ordering of the vertices, the Laplacian matrix L can be written as a circulant matrix and is, therefore, normal.

Let  = (V, E)  G be a normal digraph with Laplacian matrix L. By [4, Condition 63], we have
eT L = Le = 0,
which implies that the column sums of L are all zero. Hence  must be balanced, that is, d+(i) = d-(i) for all i  V . Figure 4 shows a digraph that is balanced but does not have a normal Laplacian, which is evident from the shape of its restricted numerical range. Therefore, the balanced property is, not surprisingly, weaker than

the normal property for digraphs. Nevertheless, the restricted numerical range of

POLYGONAL DIGRAPHS

balanced digraphs is extremely well behaved under certain operations as described in Proposition 3.1. Note that the bidirectional join of digraphs  = (V, E) and  = (V , E), where V  V  = , is defined by
    = (V  V , E  E  {(i, j), (j, i) : i  V, j  V })

and the disjoint union is defined by    = (V  V , E  E) .

Also, we use Ik to denote the k × k identity matrix, and Jk1×k2 to denote the k1 × k2 all ones matrix.

Proposition 3.1. Let 1, 2  G be balanced digraphs of order n1 and n2, respectively. Then,
(i) Wr (1  2) = conv (Wr(1)  Wr(2)  {0}) (ii) Wr 1   2 = conv ((Wr(1) + n2)  Wr(2)  {n2}) (iii) Wr 1   2 = conv ((Wr(1) + n2)  (Wr(2) + n1)  {n1 + n2}) .

Proof. Let L1 and L2 denote the Laplacian matrix of 1 and 2, respectively.

Also, let Q1 and Q2 be restrictor matrices of order n1 and n2, respectively. Finally,

define

written as

Wr(L) = conv ((Wr(L1) + n2)  (Wr(L2) + n1)  {n1 + n2}) .

Clearly, Proposition 3.1 holds for normal digraphs 1 and 2 since they are also balanced. In this case, the proof of Proposition 3.1 implies that QLQ is normal for each Laplacian matrix L of 1  2, where   {,  ,  }. Since the disjoint union and bidirectional join of two balanced digraphs are also balanced, Theorem 3.3 implies that 1  2 and 1   2 are both normal. Therefore, Proposition 3.1 provides an easy way to construct normal digraphs from other normal digraphs in a way that the
changes to the restricted numerical range are extremely well behaved.

Lemma 3.2. Let   G have order n and Laplacian matrix L. Also, let Q be a restrictor matrix of order n. Then,  is balanced if and only if eT LQ = 0.

Proof. If  is balanced, then eT L = 0 and the result is trivial. Conversely, suppose

that eT LQ = 0. Let q1, . . . , qn-1 denote the columns of Q. Since the entries of eT L must sum to zero, it follows that eT L is orthogonal to e. Hence, there exist scalars

c1, . . . , cn-1 such that

eT L = c1qT1 + · · · + cn-1qTn-1

and it follows that

eT LQ = c21, . . . , c2n-1 T .

Therefore, eT LQ = 0 forces c1 = · · · = cn-1 = 0, that is, eT L = 0, which implies that  is balanced.

Theorem 3.3. Let   G have order n and Laplacian matrix L. Also, let Q be a restrictor matrix of order n. Then, L is normal if and only if QLQ is normal and
 is balanced.

which, by [7, Lemma 2.5.2], is normal if and only if QLQ is normal and eT LQ = 0. By Lemma 3.2, eT LQ = 0 if and only if  is balanced. Therefore, Q^LQ^ is normal if and only if QLQ is normal and  is balanced.
We conclude this section by providing another method for constructing normal digraphs that cannot be described as a disjoint union or bidirectional join of two (non-null) normal digraphs. To this end, consider the following result.

(aij - aji) d+(j) - d+(i) =

(aikajk - akiakj ) ,

k=i,j

for all i = j  V .

Given a graph  = (V, E), we define the twin splitting of a vertex v  V as the process in which a copy of v is created, denoted v, such that v and v are twins, that is, (u, v)  E if and only if (u, v)  E and (v, u)  E if and only if (v, u)  E. Note that the digraph in Figure 4 can be constructed by performing a twin splitting on two nonadjacent vertices from a dicycle of order 4. It is worth emphasizing that altering the digraph in this way preserves the balanced property but destroys normality. Indeed, let i and j be vertices in Figure 4 such that i points at j, i has a twin, and j does not have a twin. It follows that the left side of (3.1) is equal to 1 and the right side of (3.1) is equal to 0, which confirms that the digraph in Figure 4 is not normal.
It turns out that we can restore the normality of the digraph in Figure 4 by adding a new vertex that is bidirectionally joined onto all the twin vertices, as in Figure 5. This process is generalized in Theorem 3.5.

Theorem 3.5. Let  = (V, E)  G be a dicycle of order n  4, where n is even. Starting at any vertex in V , construct  by performing a twin splitting on every other vertex in the dicycle. Also, let  be constructed from  by adding a new vertex that is bidirectionally joined to all the twin vertices in . Then,  is a balanced digraph that is not normal and  is a normal digraph.

Proof. Let  = (V , E) and note that |V | = 3n/2, where n vertices have twins

and the other n/2 vertices don't have twins. Consider the partition of the set of

vertices

V  = T  V  \ T,

where T is the set of vertices with twins and V  \ T is the set of vertices without twins.

Note that

d+ (i) = d- (i) = 1,

for all i  T and d+ (i) = d- (i) = 2,
for all i  V  \ T . Therefore, the digraph  is clearly balanced. Furthermore, for each vertex i  T , there exists a vertex j  V  \ T such that aij = 1 and aji = 0, that is, vertex i points at vertex j and vertex j does not point at vertex i. Therefore,
(aij - aji) d+(j) - d+(i) = 1.
Since i and j don't point at any of the same vertices, and no vertex points at both i and j, we have
(aikajk - akiakj ) = 0,
k=i,j
and it follows that (3.1) does not hold; hence,  is not normal. Now, let  = (V , E) and consider the partition of the set of vertices
V  = T  V  \ T  {v},
where v is bidirectionally joined onto all vertices in T . Therefore,
d+ (i) = d- (i) = 2,
for all i  T  V  \ T . Moreover,
d+ (v) = d- (v) = |T | ,
and it follows that  is balanced. It is also clear that (3.1) holds for all i  T and j  V  \ T since those vertices have the same out-degree and aikajk = akiakj = 0 for all k = i, j.
If i, j  T , then the vertices have the same out-degree and there exists k, k = i, j such that aikajk = 1 and akiakj = 1. Also, the vertex v satisfies aivajv = aviavj = 1, and for all other k = i, j, we have aik = ajk = akiakj = 0. Hence, the terms on the right side of (3.1) sum to zero. A similar result holds for vertices i, j  V  \ T and for j = v, i = v. Therefore, both sides of (3.1) are equal to zero for all i, j  V , and it follows that  is normal.

3.2. Restricted-Normal Digraphs. Let 1 and 2 be normal digraphs of order

n1 and n2, is normal,

respectively. Then, from where L is the Laplacian

the proof matrix of

of Proposition 3.1, it follows that QLQ 1   2 and Q is a restrictor matrix of

order n = n1 + n2. Moreover, by Theorem 3.3, it follows that L is not normal since 1   2 is not balanced. Therefore, the directed join of two normal digraphs results in a restricted-normal digraph as illustrated in Figure 2. Moreover, by Proposition 3.6,

the directed join of two normal digraphs is the only restricted-normal digraph that

can be described by a directed join of two digraphs.

define

By [7, Lemma 2.5.2], QLQ is normal if and only if Q1L1Q1 and Q2L2Q2 are normal and (en1)T L1Q1 = 0 and (en2)T L2Q2 = 0. Furthermore, by Lemma 3.2, (en1 )T L1Q1 = 0 and (en2 )T L2Q2 = 0 if and only if 1 and 2 are balanced. Thus, by Theorem 3.3, QLQ is normal if and only if L1 and L2 are normal.

Let  = (V, E)  G have order n. If n is square-free or n = 2m, where m is square-free, it turns out that  is restricted-normal if and only if it is a directed join. To help understand this result, we define the imbalance of vertex i  V by

(i) = d+(i) - d-(i).

Lemma 3.7. Let  = (V, E)  G be a digraph of order n that is not balanced. Then,  is a directed join of two balanced digraphs if and only if

(3.2)

n | ((i) - (j)) ,

for all i, j  V .
Proof. Suppose that  = 1   2, where 1 = (V1, E1) and 2 = (V2, E2) are balanced digraphs. Then, the imbalance of vertex i  V = V1  V2 satisfies

(i) = |V2| if i  V1 . - |V1| if i  V2

14

T. R. CAMERON, H. T. HALL, B. SMALL, AND A. WIEDEMANN

Therefore,

-n  (i) - (j) = 0
n

if i  V2 and j  V1 if i, j  V1 or i, j  V2 , if i  V1 and j  V2

and it follows that n | ((i) - (j)), for all i, j  V . Conversely, suppose that n | (((i) - (j)), for all i, j  V . Since |(i)|  (n - 1)
for all i  V , it follows that

(3.3)

(i) - (j)  {-n, 0, n},

for all i, j  V . Since  is not balanced and the sum of imbalances over all vertices is zero, there exists a vertex u  V such that (u) > 0 and there exists a vertex v  V such that (v) < 0. Thus, (3.3) implies that (u) - (v) = n, and we can partition the vertex set as V = V1  V2, where (i) = (u) for all i  V1 and (i) = (v) for all i  V2. Summing imbalances, we have

(u) |V1| + (v) |V2| = (u) |V1| + ((u) - n) |V2| = 0,

which implies that (u) = |V2| and ((u) - n) = - |V1|. Note that the sum of the imbalances in V2 is equal to the total out-degree minus
the total in-degree of the vertices in V2, which is also equal to the number of edges pointing from V2 to V1 minus the number of edges pointing from V1 to V2. Since the sum of the imbalances in V2 is equal to - |V1| |V2|, it follows that there are no edges pointing from V2 to V1 and there is an edge pointing from every vertex in V1 to all vertices in V2. Hence,  is a directed join of two digraphs: 1 = (V1, E1) and 2 = (V2, E2). Finally, note that the imbalance of each vertex in V would be zero if all edges pointing from V1 to V2 were removed; thus, 1 and 2 are balanced.
Lemma 3.7 shows that directed joins of balanced digraphs can be identified by their vertex imbalances. The connection between this result and restricted-normal digraphs will be made using the following propositions. First, note that given a restrictor matrix Q of order n, we denote

(3.4)

P

as the unique projector whose image space is e and kernel space is span (e).
Proposition 3.8. Let  = (V, E)  G have order n and Laplacian matrix L. Then, QLQ is normal if and only if P L is normal.
Proof. Let Q be a restrictor matrix of order n. Then, by [4, Condition 62], QLQ is normal if and only if

(3.5)

QLQx, QLQy = QLT Qx, QLT Qy ,

for all x, y  Cn-1. Since Q is a bijection between Cn-1 and e, it follows that (3.5) holds for all x, y  Cn-1 if and only if

(3.6)

QLx, QLy = QLT x, QLT y ,

for all x, y  e. Using the projector P from (3.4), we can re-write (3.6) as P Lx, Ly = P LT x, LT y .

POLYGONAL DIGRAPHS

Furthermore, since the image space of LT is equal to e, it follows that QLQ is normal if and only if

(3.7)

P Lx, Ly = LT x, LT y ,

for all x, y  e. Note that P Lx, Ly = P Lx, P Ly ; hence, (3.7) holds for all x, y  e if and only if

P Lx, P Ly = LT P x, LT P y

for all x, y  Cn, that is, if and only if P L is normal.
Proposition 3.9. Let  = (V, E)  G have order n and Laplacian matrix L. Then, for any k  V ,  is restricted-normal if and only if  is not balanced and

(3.8)

((i) - (k)) ((j) - (k)) n

=

L(ei-ek), L(ej -ek) - LT (ei -ek), LT (ej -ek) ,

for all i, j  V \ {k}.
Proof. Let {xi}i be a basis for e, where  is an arbitrary index set of cardinality (n - 1). Also, let P be the projector from (3.4). Then, one can readily verify that (3.7) implies that QLQ is normal if and only if

P Lxi, Lxj = LT xi, LT xj ,

for all i, j  . Furthermore, the set {ei - ek}iV \{k} clearly forms a basis for e, which implies that QLQ is normal if and only if

P L(ei - ek), L(ej - ek) = LT (ei - ek), LT (ej - ek) ,

for

all

Since

that

if (3.8) holds, for all i, j  V \ {k}. By Theorem 3.3,  is restricted-normal if and

We are now ready to prove that if n is square-free or n = 2m, where m is squarefree, then the only restricted-normal digraphs are directed joins.

Theorem 3.10. Let   G have order n, where n is square-free or n = 2m with m square-free. If  is a restricted-normal digraph, then  is a directed join of normal digraphs.

Proof. Suppose that  = (V, E) is restricted-normal and has Laplacian matrix L. Then, by Proposition 3.9,  is not balanced and

(3.9)

((i) - (j))2 n

=

L(ei - ej ) 2 -

LT (ei - ej ) 2 ,

for all i, j  V . Since the right side of (3.9) is integer valued, we have n | ((i) - (j))2, for all i, j  V . Furthermore, if n is square-free, then we have n | ((i) - (j)), for all i, j  V , and it follows from Lemma 3.7 that  is a directed join. Moreover, since  is restricted-normal, Proposition 3.6 implies that  is a directed join of normal digraphs.

16

T. R. CAMERON, H. T. HALL, B. SMALL, AND A. WIEDEMANN

Let L = [lij]ni,j=1 denote the Laplacian matrix of . Then, the right side of (3.9) can be written as

L(ei - ej) 2 -

LT (ei - ej ) 2 = (lki - lkj )2 - (lik - ljk)2

lk2i - li2k + lj2k - lk2j - 2 (lkilkj - likljk)

k=1 n

= -(i) - (j) - 2 (lkilkj - likljk) .

k=1

Therefore, (3.9) can be re-written as

(3.10)

((i) - (j))2 = - ((i) + (j)) - 2 n

n

(lkilkj - likljk) .

k=1

Now, suppose that n = 2m, where m is square-free. Then,

2 | n | ((i) - (j))2 ,

which implies that 2 | ((i) - (j)). Thus, we have 2 | ((i) + (j)), and it follows that

there exists an integer s such that 2s = ((i) + (j)). Therefore, we can re-write (3.10)

as

((i)

- (j))2 2m

=

-2s - 2

n

(lkilkj - likljk) ,

k=1

that is,

((i) - (j))2 4m

=

-s -

n

(lkilkj - likljk) .

k=1

Hence, m | ((i) - (j))2 /4, which implies that m | ((i) - (j)) /2, that is, n |

((i) - (j)). Therefore, if  is restricted-normal and n = 2m, where m is square-free,

then n | ((i) - (j)), for all i, j  V , and Lemma 3.7 implies that  is a directed join.

Moreover, since  is restricted-normal, Proposition 3.6 implies that  is a directed

join of normal digraphs.

According to Theorem 3.10, n = 8 is the smallest possible order for which there could exist restricted-normal digraphs that are not directed joins. In fact, 48 of the 4349 restricted-normal digraphs of order 8 (see Table 1) are not directed joins. For example, consider the digraph in Figure 6, which is clearly not a directed join based on the imbalances of its vertices, Proposition 3.6, and Lemma 3.7.
In what follows, we provide a construction for restricted-normal digraphs, where the order is neither square-free nor twice a square-free number, that are not directed joins. To this end, we make use of the following lemma which shows that restrictednormal digraphs have Laplacian matrices with a particular left-eigenvector structure.

Lemma 3.11. Let   G have order n and Laplacian matrix L. Then,  is a
restricted-normal digraph if and only if  is not balanced and there exist orthogonal eigenvectors u1, . . . , un-1  e for LT .

Proof. Let P be the projector from (3.4). By Theorem 3.3 and Proposition 3.8,  is restricted-normal if and only if  is not balanced and P L is normal. Furthermore, by [4, Condition 12 and Condition 14], P L is normal if and only if there exists

orthogonal eigenvectors u1, . . . , un-1, un  Cn for LT P . Without loss of generality, we assume that un = e. Hence, u1, . . . , un-1  e are orthogonal eigenvectors of LT , and the result follows.
Next, we provide a construction for restricted-normal digraphs of order n2, where n  3, that are not directed joins. Note that we use Jk to denote the k × k all ones matrix.
Theorem 3.12. Let   G have order n2, where n  3, and adjacency matrix

where all blank entries are zero. Then,  is a restricted-normal digraph that is not a directed join.
Proof. Note that the Laplacian matrix of  is equal to

L = (n - 1)In2 - A.
Let x1, . . . , xn  Cn satisfy
(Jn - In) x1 = en and x2 + · · · + xn = en.
Then, the vector x = [x1, · · · , xn]T satisfies Ax = en2. Hence, every vector in the null space of AT is orthogonal to en2. Furthermore, the nullity of AT is equal to n(n - 2), which implies the existence of n(n - 2) orthogonal eigenvectors for LT , corresponding to the eigenvalue (n - 1), that are perpendicular to en2 .
Now, let x1, . . . , xn  Cn be selected so that x = [x1, · · · , xn]T is an eigenvector for AT corresponding to a non-zero eigenvalue . Then,

Hence, x1 is an eigenvector of (Jn - In). Note that (Jn - In) is a symmetric matrix with eigenvalues
1 = (n - 1), 2 = -1, . . . , n = -1
and corresponding orthogonal eigenvectors that we denote by v1, . . . , vn. Also, (3.11) and (3.12) imply that

µ2k-1 = + (n - 1)k, µ2k = - (n - 1)k

are eigenvalues of AT with corresponding orthogonal eigenvectors

for k = 1, 2, . . . , n. Since v1 is a constant multiple of en, it follows that u2, . . . , u2n are perpendicular
to en2. Furthermore, u2, . . . , u2n are in the column space of A, so these vectors are orthogonal to every null vector of AT . Therefore, there are n2 - 1 orthogonal eigenvectors of LT that are perpendicular to en2, and Lemma 3.11 implies that  is restricted-normal. Furthermore, since  is clearly not balanced and its imbalances don't satisfy (3.2), Proposition 3.6 and Lemma 3.7 imply that  is not a directed join.
Next, we use the Kronecker product to construct new restricted-normal digraphs of order nk, where k  1, from old restricted-normal digraphs of order n.
Theorem 3.13. Let  = (V, E)  G be a restricted-normal digraph of order n with adjacency matrix A. For k  1, the digraph ^ = (V^ , E^)  G associated with the adjacency matrix A  Jk is a restricted-normal digraph of order nk. Furthermore, ^ is a directed join if and only if  is a directed join.
Proof. Note that the Laplacian matrix of  can be written as L = D - A, where D = diag (d+(1), . . . , d+(n)). Also, the vertex set of ^ can be written as V^ = {ij : i  V, j = 1, . . . , k} and the Laplacian matrix of ^ is equal to

L^ = k (D  Ik) - (A  Jk) .
Since the imbalance of vertex ij  V^ is equal to the corresponding column sum of L^, we have

(3.13)

^ (ij) = kd+ (i) - kd- (i) = k · (i),

for all i  V and j = 1, . . . , k.
Now, since  is a restricted-normal digraph, Lemma 3.11 implies that there exist orthogonal eigenvectors u1, . . . , un-1 for LT that are perpendicular to en. Therefore, for i = 1, . . . , n - 1, we have

L^T ui  ek = k DT  Ik ui  ek - AT  Jk = k DT ui  ek - k AT ui  ek = k LT ui  ek = kj ui  ek ,

ui  ek

POLYGONAL DIGRAPHS

where i is the eigenvalue of LT corresponding to the eigenvector ui. It follows from the mixed-product property of Kronecker producst that the eigenvectors ui  ek are orthogonal, for i = 1, . . . , n - 1, and are perpendicular to enk = en  ek .
Next, let v1, . . . , vk-1 denote the orthogonal eigenvectors of Jk corresponding to the zero eigenvalue. Also, let e1, . . . , en denote the column vectors of In, which are eigenvectors of DT corresponding to the eigenvalues d+(1), . . . , d+(n), respectively. Then, for i = 1, . . . , n and j = 1, . . . , k - 1, we have
L^T (ei  vj ) = k DT  Ik (ei  vj ) - AT  Jk (ei  vj )
= k DT ei  vj - AT ei  Jkvj
= k d+(i)ei  vj - AT ei  0
= kd+(i) (ei  vj ) .
Again, by the mixed-product property of Kronecker products, it follows that the eigenvectors (ei  vj) are orthogonal, for i = 1, . . . , n and j - 1, . . . , k - 1, and are perpendicular to enk. Moreover, since v1, . . . , vk-1 are perpendicular to ek, it follows that the eigenvectors
ui  ek , (ei  vj )
are orthogonal, for i = 1, . . . , n - 1, i = 1, . . . , n, and j = 1, . . . , k - 1. Therefore, there are nk - 1 orthogonal eigenvectors of L^T that are perpendicular
to enk, and Lemma 3.11 implies that ^ is restricted-normal. Furthermore, by (3.13), Proposition 3.6, and Lemma 3.7,  is a directed join if and only if ^ is a directed join.
We conclude this section by noting that the digraph in Figure 6 along with Theorems 3.10, 3.12, and 3.13 imply that there exist restricted-normal digraphs that are not directed joins if and only if the order is neither square-free nor twice a square-free number. Indeed, the natural numbers can be partitioned into square-free and nonsquare-free numbers. Furthermore, the non-square-free numbers can be partitioned into the forms kn2 and 4k, where n  3 and k  1 is square-free. Note that every number of the form 4k can be written as 8 times an odd square-free number or twice an even square-free number. All restricted-normal digraphs with an order that is square-free or twice a square-free number are directed joins by Theorem 3.10. For all other possible orders a restricted-normal digraph that is not a directed join can be constructed either by using Theorem 3.12 and Theorem 3.13, in the case of order kn2 with n  3 and k  1 square-free, or by using Figure 6 and Theorem 3.13, in the case of order 8k where k  1 is an odd square-free number.
4. Conclusion. The restricted numerical range is a novel tool for characterizing digraphs and studying their algebraic connectivity. In [2], digraphs with a restricted numerical range as a degenerate polygon, that is, a point or a line segment, are completely described. In this article, we extended these results to include digraphs whose restricted numerical range is a non-degenerate convex polygon in the complex plane. We refer to digraphs whose restricted numerical range is a degenerate or nondegenerate convex polygon in the complex plane as polygonal.
In Section 2, we gave computational methods for finding polygonal digraphs, and showed that these digraphs can be partitioned into three classes: normal, restrictednormal, and pseudo-normal digraphs, all of which are closed under the digraph complement. In Section 3.1, we noted that normal digraphs include any digraph whose Laplacian matrix can be written as a circulant matrix. Moreover, Proposition 3.1

20

T. R. CAMERON, H. T. HALL, B. SMALL, AND A. WIEDEMANN

and Theorem 3.3 show that both the disjoint union and the bidirectional join of two normal digraphs results in another normal digraph. Also, Theorem 3.5 provides a method for constructing normal digraphs that cannot be described as the disjoint union or bidirectional join of two (non-null) normal digraphs.
Proposition 3.1 and Theorem 3.3 also show that the directed join of two normal digraphs results in a restricted-normal digraph. Moreover, Theorem 3.10 shows that when the order is square-free or twice a square-free number, the only restricted-normal digraphs are directed joins of two normal digraphs. Finally, Figure 6 along with Theorems 3.12 and 3.13 provide a construction for restricted-normal digraphs that are not directed joins when the order is neither square-free nor twice a square-free number.
Future research includes further investigation of the subclass of restricted-normal digraphs that are not directed joins and the class of pseudo-normal digraphs.
