arXiv:2106.00405v1 [eess.SP] 1 Jun 2021

Abstract--Co-prime sampling is a strategy for acquiring the signal below the Nyquist rate. The prototype and extended coprime samplers require two low rate sub-samplers. One of the sub-samplers in the extended co-prime scheme is not utilized for every alternate co-prime period. Therefore, this paper proposes a time multiplexing strategy to utilize the vacant slots. It describes the deviation from the existing theory. Closed-form expressions for weight functions are provided. Acquisition of two signals is described with three samplers as well as two samplers. A generalized structure is also proposed with an extremely sparse co-prime sampling strategy.
Index Terms--Co-prime, low latency, multiplexing, sampling, sparse, sub-Nyquist.
I. INTRODUCTION
A CQUISITION of signals with very large bandwidths require high rate analog-to-digital converters. Several researchers are investigating the use of low rate samplers to achieve results comparable with the high rate samplers. Minimum redundancy array [1] and minimum hole array [2] are some of the works reported from a sub-Nyquist antenna array perspective. Later, nested and co-prime arrays were proposed [3], [4] with mathematical expressions to describe its properties. Co-prime sampling is a strategy that can be used to estimate the statistics of a signal at Nyquist rate with sub-Nyquist samplers [4]. The prototype co-prime sampler has two low rate samplers with inter-sample distance M d and N d where (M, N ) is co-prime and d is the Nyquist period. The coprime sampling strategy has been used for several applications in the literature [4]Г[25]. Several modifications to the nested and co-prime array have also been reported [26]Г[43]. Large latency for estimation of the statistics of a signal was a cause of concern. Researchers have also investigated low latency estimation using the co-prime scheme [5], [42], [44]Г[48].
This paper analyzes the co-prime sampling strategy for time division multiplexing. One of the early modifications to the prototype co-prime array is the extended co-prime array/sampler proposed in [49]. It is proposed since the prototype co-prime strategy has missing difference values/lag in the co-prime period. The work in [50] develops the extended co-prime theory using the combined signals with low latency. It may be observed in Fig.2- [50] that one of the samplers is turned on-off every co-prime period M N d. This motivates the idea for time multiplexing of the extended co-prime sampler. An example of time division multiplexing front-end can be found in [51]. The broad idea is shown in Fig. 1. The focus

of this paper is to describe time-multiplexing of the coprime sampler. Next we will briefly describe time division multiplexing for the Nyquist case followed by the extended co-prime sampler and the generalized extremely sparse coprime sampler.
II. TIME DIVISION MULTIPLEXING
A. Uniform Nyquist Sampling
The traditional uniform sampling can be employed to acquire multiple signals as shown in Fig. 2a. However, a single sampler can be employed with twice the Nyquist rate by time multiplexing the sampler as shown in Fig. 2b. It shows two signals x1(t) and x2(t). In general multiple signals can be acquired by time multiplexing the sampler. This depends on the availability of a higher rate sampler. x1(k) = {x1(t)|t = kd} and x2(k) = {x2(t)|t = kd} represent the acquired samples in Fig. 2a. d is the Nyquist sampling period. In Fig. 2b,

x2(k) = {x2(t)|t = kd + dt}. The acquired data can be used for detection and estimation of the second order statistics, filtering, etc. Note that certain applications may require the estimation of cross-correlation or cross-spectrum. Therefore, the algorithms may require access to both x1(k) and x2(k).
B. Extended Co-Prime Sampling
The extended co-prime sampling has two sub-samplers with M and N times lower sampling rate. Refer Fig.2 in [50]. Let us assume that there are two different signals or random processes x1(t) and x2(t) which need to be sampled. Extended co-prime sampling will require (2+2)=4 sub-samplers. As shown in Fig. 3a. Note that one of the sub-samplers in each case is off for one co-prime period M N d. This slot can be used to acquire the other signal. Fig. 3b demonstrates this time multiplexing idea. Now three samplers are required for implementation. Traditionally, an extended co-prime structure has one sub-sampler with samples at location M nd with 0  n  N - 1 i.e. the first co-prime period M N d. The other sub-sampler has samples at location N md with

0  m  2M -1 i.e. first and second co-prime period 2M N d. This can be observed in Fig. 3b for the signal x1(t) (marked with black). The theory for this case has been well studied
in [50]. Below we mention the expressions for the acquired signal x1(t): x1M (n) = {x1(t)|t = M nd} and x1N (m) = {x1(t)|t = N md}. The combined signal x1C (k) at Nyquist rate is given by:

 

x1M (n),

for k = M n, n = [0, N - 1]

x1C (k) = x1N (m),

for k = N m, m = [0, 2M - 1]

 0, otherwise

(1)

Now observe the signal x2(t) (marked in red) in Fig. 3b. One sub-sampler acquires samples for two periods N md with
0  m  2M -1. The other samples are at locations M nd but
with n in the range N  n  2N - 1. x2M (n) = {x2(t)|t = M nd} and x2N (m) = {x2(t)|t = N md}. Keep in mind that the range of n is different when compared with x1(t). The

The question that needs to be answered is whether the theory developed in [50] would be valid here. To this end it is important to analyze the difference sets and weight function/number of contributors for estimation.
Let us consider an example with M = 4, N = 3. In addition, we can assume d = 1 throughout the paper without affecting the behaviour for general values of d. For x1(t), the sub-sampler with inter-element spacing N d has samples at locations [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21] and sub-sampler with M d spacing has samples at [0, 4, 8]. Refer Fig. 3b (black samples). The self difference and cross difference matrix is given in Fig.3 and Fig.4 in [50] respectively. The weight function and bias window is given by equation (1) and (10) in [50] respectively. Now for x2(t) (Fig. 3b marked in red), the sub-sampler with inter-element spacing N d has samples at locations [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]. This is same as the locations for x1(t) hence the self difference matrix is same. The second sub-sampler with spacing M d has samples at [12, 16, 20]. The self difference matrix is given in Fig. 4a. Note that the contents of the matrix here is same as (Fig.3a in [50]). The cross difference matrix L+c is given in Fig. 4b. The area marked in red is a deviation from the previous known theory. Let us compute the number of pairs for autocorrelation estimation z1(l) and z2(l) (for x1(t) and x2(t) respectively). This can be computed as described in

Fig.4.6 in [5]. The combined sampling points/pattern for x1(t) is: p1(k)=[1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0] and x2(t) is: p2(k)=[1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0]. Therefore, z1(l)=[10 2 2 7 3 2 6 1 2 5 1 1 4 1 1 3 0 1 2 0 0 1 0 0] and z2(l)=[10 2 2 7 2 2 6 1 1 5 1 1 4 1 1 3 1 1 2 0 1 1 0 0] for l = [0, 2M N - 1]. Note that z1(l) and z2(l) is symmetric for negative lags i.e. l = [-1, -2M N - 1]. z1(l) = z2(l) for l = [▒4 ▒ 8 ▒ 16 ▒ 20] i.e. for l = ▒M n with n = [1, 2, и и и N - 1, N + 1, N + 2, и и и 2N - 1]. In fact,
z1(l) = z2(l) + 1 for l = ▒M n with n = [1, 2, и и и N - 1] and z1(l) = z2(l) - 1 for l = ▒M n with n = [N + 1, N + 2, и и и 2N - 1]. z1(l) = z2(l) = 100 for the example considered. z2(l) has 2(N - 1) additional unique lag values, i.e. ▒16, ▒20 for the example considered. The expression for
the number of contributors z1(l) is given by (1) in [50]. While the expression for z2(l) is given below:

N -1

2N -1

z2(l) =

(N - | n |)(l - M n) +

(| l | -M n)

n=-(N -1)

(| l | -|M n - N m|)

n=N +1 m=1

(3)

It is straight forward to obtain the correlogram bias window

in this case as the Fourier transform of z2(l).

Next let us implement the time multiplexing for extended

co-prime sampling with two samplers. This is shown in Fig. 5.

For x1(t) (marked in black), both the samplers have the same

sampling locations as described in Fig. 3b. Therefore the self

and cross differences are same. For x2(t) (marked in red) in

Fig. 5, the sampler associated with switch SW2 has same

sampling locations as Fig. 3b. Therefore the self difference

is same. But the sampler associated with switch SW1 has a

different sampling location. x2M (n) = {x2(t)|t = M nd, n =

[N, 2N

and

pling locations are [1.5, 4.5, 7.5, 10.5, 13.5, 16.5, 19.5, 22.5].

The self difference matrix is given in Fig. 6a. Note that this

matrix is same as that in (Fig.3b in [50]) and has integer

values (multiples of N ). However, the cross difference matrix

does not have integer values as shown in Fig. 6b. This relates

to the concept of super Nyquist sampling [42]. This implies

that

SW1(1), SW1(2), SW2(1), and SW2(2) also depends on N ,

M , and d. Next let us discuss a more generalized set-up for sampling
known as the Extremely Sparse Co-Prime Arrays/Samplers (ExSCA) [43].

III. GENERALIZED ACQUISITION AND SAMPLING STRATEGY

In the simplest form, the ExSCA sampling strategy uses

factors ExM and ExN as inter-sample distance. Two different

signals can be acquired using the ExSCA strategy as in Fig. 7a.

It requires four samplers. However, if a co-prime pair of

samplers (M, N ) is available, then ExSCA can be easily

implemented with two samplers as shown in Fig. 7b. The

switching waveforms are provided. It is important to note that

one of the locations of x2(t) is coinciding in the two samplers.

This is bad since it can lead to aliasing as described in [43].

Therefore, the parameters need to be selected wisely. For the

example in Fig. 7b, sij represents the shift of sampler-j from

the origin for signal xi(t). Normally, s11 can be assumed as

the origin, i.e. s11 = 0. The shift for the second signal x2(t)

with

sampler-1

is

s21

=

s11

+

Ex M 2

.

For

the

second

sampler,

s12 needs to be designed to prevent aliasing and maximize

information

(along

with

M,

N,

and

Ex).

s22

=

s12

+

Ex N 2

.

As

an example, if Ex = 2, M = 4, N = 3, s11 = 0, and s12 = 1,

then s21 = 4 and s22 = 4. However, these parameters are

not a good choice since the samples for x2(t) overlap. The

example here has two signals x1(t), x2(t) and two samplers.

However, three signals can also be sampled with just two

co-prime samplers using the Extremely sparse strategy with Ex = 3.
It may also be noted that Exd can be designed to have different Nyquist sampling rate for x1(t) and x2(t). d represents the smallest Nyquist period corresponding to the signal with the highest bandwidth. Here, super Nyquist sampling may be viewed as a special case of ExSCA. In a more generalized setting, we can have q samplers with different factors E1, E2, и и и Eq. Refer Fig.44 in [43]. Also note that, x1(t) and x2(t)

are different signals. In general, there could be rs such signals: x1(t), x2(t),и и и xrs(t). However, they may be acquired from a single sensor/antenna as shown in Fig. 8. The hardware can convert the signal to the appropriate intermediate frequency or baseband. Each one of them could have a different bandwidth and hence a different Nyquist sampling period. This can be further time-multiplexed with q different samplers. The rs signals need not be fully connected to all q samplers.
Furthermore, rx sensors/antennas can be used to sense the

IV. CONCLUSION
This paper describes time division multiplexing for acquisition of signals using the extended co-prime scheme. The difference set is analyzed and closed-form expression for the contributors for estimation is provided. It also describes the implementation of a time multiplexed extremely sparse co-prime sampler using the standard co-prime sub-samplers. The work presented here can sample signals with different bandwidths or Nyquist sampling periods. A single antenna or sensor can be employed to capture the wideband signal which can be converted to the desired narrow-band signals for sampling. It also provides a generalized structure with multiple sensors/antennas which can be employed based on the application. The number of signals to be acquired can be more than, less than, or equal to the number of samplers. This would depend on the constraints of the application.
