## Abstract

Relevant information about physical properties of the surface of airless bodies such as porosity, particle size, or roughness can be inferred knowing the dependence of the brightness with illumination and observing geometry. Additionally, this knowledge is necessary to standardize or photometrically correct data acquired under different illumination conditions. In this work we develop a robust, automatic, and efficient photometric modeling methodology which is tested and validated using Bennu images acquired by the camera MapCam from the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. It consists of a supervised machine learning algorithm through an artificial neural network. Our system provides a more precise modeling for all color filters than the previous procedures which are already published, offering an improvement over this classic approach of up to 14.30%, as well as a considerable reduction in computing time.
