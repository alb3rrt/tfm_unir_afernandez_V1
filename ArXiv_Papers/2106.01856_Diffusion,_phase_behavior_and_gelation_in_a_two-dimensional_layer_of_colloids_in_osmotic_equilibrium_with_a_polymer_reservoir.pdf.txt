The addition of enough non-adsorbing polymer to an otherwise stable colloidal suspension gives rise to a variety of phase behavior and kinetic arrest due to the depletion attraction induced between the colloids by the polymers. We report a study of these phenomena in a two-dimensional layer of colloids. The three-dimensional phenomenology of crystal-fluid coexistence is reproduced, but gelation takes a novel form, in which the strands in the gel structure are locally crystalline. We compare our findings with a previous simulation and theory, and find substantial agreement.

I. INTRODUCTION
Adding non-adsorbing polymers to a suspension of hardsphere colloids (radius R, volume fraction c) induces a depletion attraction between the particles.1­3 Exclusion of polymers from the space between two nearby particles leaves an unbalanced osmotic pressure pushing them together. The depth and range of the depletion attraction Udep(r) between two particles with centre-to-centre distance of r is proportional to the polymer activity, ap, and the polymer's radius of gyration, rg, respectively. When the size ratio  = rg/R 0.30 ± 0.05,4,5 the equilibrium (c, ap) phase diagram displays an expanded region of fluid-crystal (F-X) coexistence at ap O(10-1),6 which occurs for 0.494 < c < 0.545 at ap = 0.
`Buried' within the equilibrium F-X coexistence region is a metastable gas-liquid (G-L) coexistence binodal that terminates at a critical point. A homogeneous sample inside this binodal should in principal first phase separate into metastable coexisting G-L phase, before further separating into equilibrium F-X coexistence.7 This scenario is, however, seldom observed, because kinetic arrest intervenes.
For 0.1 c 0.3, samples inside the metastable G-L coexistence region will phase separate by spinodal decomposition into a bicontinuous structure. With time, this structure coarsens in length scale, and the concentration difference between the two phases increases, until the concentration of the liquid phase crosses the `attractive glass transition'. line8 The texture arrests and the system becomes a gel.9,10
Such `depletion gels' have been intensively studied for some time, but mysteries remain, perhaps especially how they age with time. In some cases, a depletion gel can undergo sudden gravitational collapse after an apparently quiescent period in which little seems to happen macroscopically.11­14 This and other aging phenomena are expected on thermodynamic grounds. A depletion gel is metastable. There is therefore a driving force for evolution towards the lowest free energy state, which is F-X coexistence.
What we have summarised so far pertains to bulk colloidpolymer mixtures. At first sight, there is little incentive to study two-dimensional (2D) systems: presumably, any difference to bulk behavior would be merely quantitative. However, this intuition turns out to be incorrect.

An early 2D study extended the `primitive' theory for bulk phase behavior4 to calculate the phase diagram of a bulk colloid-polymer mixture in the presence of a hard wall.15 The theory predicts that depletion-induced wall adsorption in-
duces wall freezing (= crystallization) at depletant concentrations below the bulk F-X coexistence boundary. An inter-
esting subtlety, Fig. 1(a), is that both colloids and depletants at the surface are in osmotic equilibrium with the bulk, with
which they can exchange both species. Thus, unlike in the bulk, which is a canonical ensemble where F-X coexistence
is possible, surface crystallization occurs in a grand-canonical ensemble, so that the crystal fraction jumps from 0 to 1 at
the critical bulk polymer concentration (at fixed colloid volume fraction). Experiments using large (RL = 0.23µm) and small (RS = 0.035µm) charge-stabilised polystyrene spheres (screening length  5 nm) in which the small spheres act as depletants16 confirmed this feature, and found reasonable
agreement with theory for the wall crystallization boundary.
The sedimentation height z0 of the large spheres in these experiments, defined such that the number of particles of ra-
dius R in a dilute suspension decreases with height according to n(z) = n(0)e-(z-R)/z0, is z0 = 160 µm  RL, as assumed in the theory.15 Two other experiments used much lower z0/R. Savage et al.17 used R = 0.7 µm polystyrene spheres (z0  8 R) with non-ionic surfactant micelles as depletants. Hobbie18 studied binary polystyrene colloids with RL = 1.45 µm (z0  0.4 RL) and RS = 0.107µm. In each case, gravity and the particle-wall depletion attraction sufficed to
confine all of the large particles to an effectively 2D layer (at low enough bulk concentration).
Now, the surface layer is a canonical ensemble of a fixed
number of large particles, but a grand-canonical ensemble of the smaller depletants, which freely exchanges with the bulk, Fig. 1(b). In this `semi-grand canonical' scenario,19 wall crystallization takes the form of F-X coexistence, with an increas-
ing crystal fraction as the bulk concentration of depletants (which controls the surface depletant chemical potential) increases. This is indeed seen in experiments,17,18 where crystal nucleation is two-stepped, proceeding via an intermediate gas-liquid phase separation, as predicted by theory.7. Such kinetics is seldom seen in bulk, where the metastable gas-liquid critical point nevertheless enhances crystal nucleation.20

Cerdà et al. have simulated a system mimicking a 2D colloid-polymer mixture: nearly-hard disks interacting via an Asakura-Oosawa (AO) potential, which is widely used to model polymer-induced depletion.3 They worked at a size ratio  = 0.1, and probed the behavior at a surface colloid area fraction c = 0.157. Cerdà et al. found F-X coexistence when the contact value of the AO potential, U0  3.130 kBT . At the even higher U0 = 7 kBT , they observed ramified clusters with fractal dimension df  1.4, the exponent for diffusion-limited cluster aggregation (DLCA). However, the local structure of the cluster strands is, unlike DLCA, clearly crystalline. This finding has yet to be confirmed by experiments.
Here, we study a 2D colloid-polymer mixture in which we quantify how two-dimensionality by comparing diffusivities next to a wall against Faxén's prediction.21? ,22 The equilibrium phase diagram is obtained and compared with theory.15 We confirm the locally-crystalline nature of the ramified clusters at the highest attractions.23 Quantitatively, the time dependence of the average cluster size n¯  tz, with 0.5 z 0.6. We discuss the possible origin of this exponent in the screened near-wall hydrodynamics of clusters, and propose why the local structure of our ramified clusters are crystalline, in striking contrast to the case of 3D depletion gels.24
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used 1.5 µm diameter (2R) silica spheres (Bangs Laboratories, density   2 g cm-3). The work we report is part of a larger program25 studying the effect of self-propelled particles on colloidal gels, where the self-propelled particles are motile Escherichia coli bacteria,26 for which we need to know the behavior of the cell-free system. We therefore dispersed our colloids in a phosphate motility buffer (PMB) commonly used to study motile E. coli (6.2 mM K2HPO4, 3.8 mM KH2PO4

and 0.1 mM EDTA at pH  7.5). We removed the NaCl usu-
ally included in standard PMB to limit the ionic strength to
I = 22.4 mM (screening length 2 nm). Under these conditions,
our colloids do not visibly aggregate, so that any residual in-
terparticle attraction is kBT . The colloids sediment rapidly as single particles to the bottom of our sample chambers. Bulk volume fractions of 10-4 c 2 × 10-3 gave surface area fractions of 0.04 c 0.8.
To induce depletion attraction, we added sodium polystyrene sulphonate (NaPSS, Mw  106 Da; Sigma Aldrich, used as purchased). NaPSS behaves as a ideal neu-
tral polymer in a medium with I = 3.1 M, while at I = 0.15 M we have a good solvent.27 We therefore expect swollen coils
in our PMB. We estimated the overlap concentration as the inverse intrinsic viscosity,28 which came from extrapolating
Kraemer and Huggins plots of the measured viscosity as a function of polymer concentration,28,29 giving cp  0.44 wt%. From this, we estimate a radius of gyration, rg, of NaPSS in PMB using

cp

=

3Mw 4 rg3NA

,

(1)

where NA is Avogadro's constant, giving rg  45 nm, and a colloid:polymer size ratio of   0.06.
The contact depletion attraction, U0, is proportional to the polymer activity, ap, which in turn scales as the polymer concentration in a reservoir in osmotic equilibrium with the colloid-polymer mixture.3,4 In our system, this is well approx-
imated by the bulk polymer concentration. This we report as a polymer volume fraction, p, estimated using a coil volume of 4rg3/3, so that overlap, Eq. (1), corresponds to p = 1. We work in the range 0  p  0.4.
We sealed samples into 400 µm-high glass capillaries and aged them for  2 h before video recording in a Nikon TiEclipse inverted microscope, typically using a ×50 objective to resolve single particles. We tracked particles using a
Mikrotron high-speed camera (MC 1362) to determine bulk
and near-wall diffusivities. A Hamamatsu Orca 4.0 CMOS
camera was used to identify clusters, from which we obtained
information on nearest neighbors, defined as all of a particle's neighbors whose centres are within 2R + 2rg + 0.1 µm  1.7 µm, where the 0.1 µm accommodates polydispersity. We also used a ×10 (N.A. = 3) objective to obtain images in which single particles were not resolved. We thresholded
these images, identified clusters and calculated their areas us-
ing custom software. Results for small clusters from the two
methods agree up to a scaling constant between cluster area in (pixel)2 and particle number. The calibrated low-resolution
method gives better statistics, especially for larger clusters.

III. THEORY
Previously, a mean-field van der Waals free-volume theory was used to predict the wall freezing transition in a grand canonical system.16 In our semi-grand canonical ensemble, Fig. 1(b), the approach simplifies considerably, as there is no

2D depletion

need to equilibrate colloids in the wall layer and the bulk. The semi-grand canonical free energy F with ideal depletants is

F = F0 - dkBT Vfree 0,

(2)

where F0 is the free energy of a reference system of 2Dconfined hard spheres, and Vfree is the volume available to depletants of bulk number density d averaged over the positions of the colloids in the reference system. The deple-
tants are mutually non-interacting (ideal), and exert an osmotic pressure dkBT in the bulk, which acts as a reservoir. They cannot approach  rd to the surface of a colloid.
For F0 we use published free energies of the hard disc fluid and hexagonally-ordered crystal31 that account well for two-
dimensional freezing. For the former (cf. Eq. (18) in Ref. 31):

where c is the area fraction of colloids. After the first two
ideal terms, the next two terms give the excess free energy per particle after Rosenfeld.32 For the 2D crystal, we follow Hall's procedure for 3D hard-sphere crystals33 and fitted

F0(crystal) = ln NckBT

to the 2D crystal curve in Fig. 2 of Ref. 31 Here, c = 4(1 - c/max) where max =  3/6  0.907 is hexagonal closepacking. Least-squares fitting gives c0  3.08 and c1  0.30. As expected, as c  max, c  0 and F0crystal  . With Eqs. (3) and (4) we find coexistence between 2D F-X coexistence for 0.670 < c < 0.732, agreeing with Ref. 31.
For the free volume we use the standard expansion,3

 Vfree = const - NcV1 + i> j V2(ri j) + . . .

(5)

where V1 is the excluded volume for an isolated colloidal particle allowing for the overlap with the depletion layer at the wall, V2(r) is the overlap of the excluded volumes for a pair of colloids with centre-to-centre distance r, and we sum over all pairs of particles {i, j}. We do not require first two terms: they only contribute constants to the pressure and chemical
potential that do not affect phase behaviour in the semi-grand
ensemble. This is in contrast to the wall freezing transition
in a bulk colloidal suspension where the absolute value of the
colloid chemical potential is required, including the contribution from V1, to solve for the bulk-wall equilibria.16
Despite 2D colloidal confinement, the volumes in Eq. (5)
are 3D, which precludes the use of scaled particle theory to
estimate Vfree 0. However, there will be no three-body over2la/ps 3o-f t1hed0e.p1l5et4i7o,n34l.ayMerosreoofvtehrr,etehesrpehiesrensoifovredr/lRap=ofth<e depletion layers of two particles and the wall if  < 1/4. Both conditions are satisfied in our case. So, we terminate Eq. (5)
at the 2-body term and use the standard AO result

(8) in both the fluid and hexagonally-ordered crystal. For the fluid phase we use  = 0.5 (our results are insensitive to 0.2    1). This corresponds to the typical contact peak in the radial distribution function in a dense fluid.37 For the hexagonally-ordered crystal phase,  = 0.1 ensures that the effective co-ordination number is around 6 at c  0.85.

Equation (10) with Eqs. (3) and (4) are solved numerically for phase coexistence as p increases. A typical result is shown in Fig. 2 for size ratio  = 0.06. Ideal depletants broaden the two-phase region as in the bulk,3,4 with the onset of the effect being at around d = d(2rd)3/6 0.1. We later compare this prediction to our experiments by identifying (rd, d) with (rg, p).
The limit of thermodynamic stability in the fluid can be found as the locus of points where d2F/dc2 vanishes. This gives the dashed `spinodal' line in Fig. 2 (the fluid is unstable to the right of the line). Finally, the chained line shows the prediction of the fluid binodal using a simplified approach in which we only take into account the cohesive polymerinduced AO `bond' energies in the crystal (see Appendix A).

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

A. 2D Confinement

At a density difference of   103 kg m-3 with PMB, our particles sediment at  1 µm s-1. A dilute suspension takes
10 min to establish steady state in a 400 µm-high capillary,38 to give a height-dependent particle density (at p = 0)39 of n(z) = n(0)e-(z-R)/z0, with a calculated z0 = 0.23 µm. The confinement is further increased when polymer is added to in-
duce a depletion attraction between the particles and the bot-
tom capillary surface. So, we study an essentially two dimen-
sional (2D) layer of colloids at the bottom capillary surface.
To quantify the confinement, we determined low c diffusivities by tracking. The bulk diffusivity D0 = 0.28 µm2 s-1 calculated from the Stokes-Einstein relation is reduced by
near-wall hydrodynamics to

D = D0,

(11)

with  < 1, Fig. 3. Stronger attraction reduces D by lowering the particle-wall distance and so increases hydrodynamic

hindrance. Faxén's approximate calculation predicts21? ,22

taking into account the increased viscosity of the polymer solution, µp, relative to that of PMB, µ0, both of which we measured using standard rheometry.
Equation (17) gives a good account of our data, Fig. 3. The calculated average gap z¯ - R between a particle and the surface, where z¯ is obtained from Eq. (17) with  (z) replaced by z, drops from 0.23 µm at p = 0 to 2.5 nm at p = 0.836, Fig. 3 (inset). Our system, especially at p > 0, is indeed highly confined to a thin 2D layer, with the smallest gap being comparable to the expected roughness of our particles.40,41
This exercise also validates the use of the AO expression un-
der our conditions for the polymer-induced attraction between
two spherical particles, for which Eq. (15) is a special case
(taking one sphere to have infinite radius).

B. Phase diagram and cluster statistics
Visually, our system shows four regimes, Fig. 4(a). At (p 0.15, c 0.6), we find single particles and transient cluster with n 4 particles, Fig. 4(b). This is a colloidal fluid. At higher c and p. we observe F-X coexistence of single particles and colloidal crystallites, Fig. 4(c). At the highest

2D depletion

from particle i to j and an arbitrary fixed axis. Perfect crystallinity gives 6 = 1.
Consider first the data for c = 0.19, Fig. 4(e). At p = 0, 6 = 0. Increasing the polymer concentration, we find 6 remaining low until p  0.14, whereupon 6 increases sharply, evidencing transition to F-X coexistence. The same behavior occurs at c = 0.30 and 0.39. We take the transition to FX coexistence in each case to be the first data point where 6  0.2. These points, open squares in Fig. 4(a), agree well with the phase boundary determined by inspecting micrographs. At each c studied, 6 reaches at sharp peak of
0.8, and then falls. This is the onset of progressively more ramified crystalline clusters with increasing fraction of edges. We argue below that at long times, these clusters will percolation to form a gel. We therefore take the peak position in 6 as the gel boundary, open triangles in Fig. 4(a), which again agrees with the visually-demarcated onset of ramified clustering.
In the ramified cluster regime, we measured cn, the number of clusters of size n. Figure 5(a) shows how cn normalised by the total number of cluster c (so that n cn/c = 1) evolves with time for a sample with c = 0.2 and p = 0.326. From these cluster size distributions (CSDs), we extracted the average cluster size n¯(t), Fig. 5(c). It is clear that the clusters are growing throughout our experimental time window, albeit with a reducing growth rate, suggesting that the system will percolate at even longer times to form a gel. Our experimentallyidentified transition from F-X to ramified clusters is therefore the system's gel boundary.

p and c 0.75, we observe ramified clusters whose strands are crystalline, Fig. 4(d). Finally, at c 0.75, we observe a polycrystalline monolayer over a small range of p.

V. DISCUSSION
A. Equilibrium phase behavior
Apart from a difference in size ratio, our system should be directly comparable to the simulations by Cerdà et al.,23 who studied nearly-hard particles at c = 0.157 interacting via an AO attractive potential with dimensional range  = 0.1 (we have  = 0.06). At U0 = 3.130 kBT , they observed a transition from `small fluctuating clusters' ­ our fluid phase ­ to large hexagonal close packed clusters in a background of single particles ­ our F-X coexistence. Our transition from fluid to F-X coexistence occurs at p 0.16, corresponding to U0(c) 4kBT , where U0(c) = U0(w)/2 (cf. Eq. (16)) is the dimensionless colloid-colloid depletion attraction at contact.3
Next, we compare our experimental phase diagram with the theory outlined in Section III. To do so, we need to relate the exclusion radius of the depletant, rd, to a property of the polymer in our system. Clearly, rd = crg for some dimensionless constant c. The result for taking c = 1, so that d = p, is plotted in Fig. 4(a). (Taking c = 1 means we reproduce Fig. 2 in Fig. 4(a).) The theory gives a credible account of the shape of the F-X boundary for c < 0.67 (where hard disks freeze). Quantitatively, the agreement is much better than order of magnitude. Such agreement is significant. Our theory predicts the onset of significant depletion effects on the

2D depletion

6

case. We do so via the second virial coefficient, B2, which is often used to compare results for potentials of different shapes

in the same spatial dimension.42 In our case, we normalise B2
by the hard-sphere or hard-disk values in 3D and 2D to give a dimensionless b2.43 The F-X coexistence boundary for a 3D colloid-polymer mixture at c < 0.494 (the onset of bulk crystallization) occurs at b2(3D)  -0.67, which is also the crystallization threshold for many globular protein solutions.44 In-

terestingly, our F-X boundary at p  0.16, Fig. 4(a), corre-

sponds to b2(2D)  0.72. Backing out an equivalent p = 0.21

,

we

find

that their F-X transition occurs at b2(2D) = 0.74. This agrees

with our experimental value, but differs significantly from the

3D value of  -0.67. Thus, in 2D, the depletion attraction

does not have to be as strong to bring the system into F-X

coexistence. In this sense, crystallization is easier in 2D.

Finally, we note that Li et al. reported an experimental

study of a system of sedimented PMMA colloids (2RL = 3.27 µm) with depletion attraction induced by smaller (2RS = 0.192µm) PMMA colloids (giving  = 0.05).? In contrast to

our experiments and theoretical prediction, where the F-X coexistence region expands rather suddenly at p  10-1, Fig.
4(a), their F-X coexistence expands gradually from the p = 0

region. We do not at present understand the origins of this

difference, and will not discuss their findings further.

(b) Scaled normalised cluster size distribution according to Eq. (20). Blue = data sets for 10 min < t < 100 min Red = later data sets. Continuous curve = fitting of blue data sets to Eq. (21), giving  = -0.76. (c) Evolution of average cluster size with time. The line has slope z = (1 -  )-1 = 0.568. The blue data in (b) are from the interval between the vertical lines.
F-X transition occurs at p(2d)3  O(1), because it is this particular dimensionless combination that enters the free energy in Eq. (10). If our model incorporates wrong physics, then another length, the colloid radius R, may also enter into the non-dimensionalisation of p, potentially altering the predicted phase boundary by a factor of  ,  2 or  3. Given that our   O(10-1), the good agreement we find without fine tuning c confirms that depletion correctly captures the essential physics of the phase behavior in our system.
It is interesting to compare our phase diagram with the 3D

Strikingly, our ramified clusters are locally crystalline, Fig. 4(d). This contrasts with 3D gelation, in which the ramified clusters are locally amorphous, displaying a variety of `locally-favored structures' such as icosahedra that are denser than crystalline packing but cannot tessellate space.24,45 The absence of such structures in 2D is the origin of locallycrystalline ramified clusters in our system; it is presumably also related to why crystallization is `easier' in 2D.
In 3D, gelation in colloid-polymer mixtures is triggered by a coarsening spinodal gas-liquid phase separation texture that kinetically arrests. In our system, the theoretical fluid spinodal (dashed line in Fig. 2) occurs far above the experimental gel boundary, Fig. 4(a). However, the spinodal is where density fluctuations diverge. At this point, the the mean field-van der Waals approximation implied by Eq. (2) that underpins the free volume theory is questionable since the two terms in Eq. (2) are likely to be of the same order of magnitude. We therefore cannot rule out that the onset of ramified structures is still co-incident with an underlying spinodal-like thermodynamic transition in the fluid.47
Cerdà et al.23 found ramified, locally-crystalline clusters at U0 = 7 kBT at c = 0.2, which is consistent with our data, Fig. 4(a), where p = 0.25 corresponds to a contact attraction of 6.25kBT . Their CSD data collapsed according to the ansatz

cn(t) = M1[s(t)]-2 f [n/s(t)] ,

(20)

where Mk = n nkcn is the k-th moment of the CSD, and s = M2/M1 is a measure of the (time-dependent) average clus-

ter size. We attempt this scaling for our data, Fig. 5(b). The resulting f for the earliest time, t = 6 min ( 36× the time for a single particle to diffuse its own diameter), does not show the same peaked behavior as data from all other times. We exclude these data from further consideration. Equation (20) collapses data from 10 min t 100 min, into a universal f that is peaked, Fig. 5(b) [blue]. Data from t 100 min, Fig. 5(b) [red], are increasingly noisy, and show systematic deviations from a single universal curve, especially at n/s 2.
For DLCA, the function f in Eq. (21) takes the form46

form to the red data in Fig. Fig. 5(b)to obtain   -0.76 ±

Kinetic scaling arguments by Kolb48 predict that the mean

aggregation number in d-dimensional DLCA grows with time

as n¯(t)  tz, where the dynamic critical exponent z = df/(df - (d - 3)), and df is the fractal dimension of the ramified clus-

ters. Importantly, it can be shown that

z

,

(22)

so that  = (d - 3)/df. For two-dimensional DLCA,49,50 df  1.4 implies   -0.71, which is close to our fitted value.
The above assumes that the cluster mobility is inversely proportional to the cluster radius (i.e.  = -df-1 in Eq. (1) in Kolb) but there are reasons to believe that the far-field hydro-
dynamic interactions may be screened for wall-bound clusters (see Appendix B) which would instead make the clus-
ter mobility ultimately inversely proportional to the aggregation number ( = -1 in Kolb) yielding z = 1/2 and  = -1. The best fit of Eq. (20) with the constraint  = -1 is almost visually indistinguishable from the unconstrained bestfit  = -0.76 on the scale of Fig. 5(b). Our data therefore cannot distinguish between these two models.
Our best-fit value  = -0.76 differs from Cerdà et al.23 who find  = -0.35, but this exponent is sensitive to details such as the system concentration. More importantly, we
should seek internal consistency in the form of Eq. (22). For  = -0.76, we expect z = 0.568. This dynamical exponent gives a reasonable account of our intermediate-time n¯(t) data, Fig. 5(c). On the other hand, it is clear that our data will not
be able to decide between this exponent and the value of 0.5 expected with near-wall hydrodynamic screening.
Systematic deviations from a pure power-law behavior occurs at the end of the intermediate time window and beyond,
Fig. 5(c). As time went on, particles increasingly adhered to the capillary surface, especially at higher p. This is not surprising, considering the small particle-wall gaps inferred from diffusivity, Fig. 3 (inset). The probability of adesion increases
with cluster size n. An adhered cluster can no longer diffuse translationally, and has, at best, restricted rotational diffusiv-
ity. Such adhesion will cause deviations from either of the predicted modes of dynamical scaling.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS
We have studied experimentally a layer of colloids at the bottom of a glass capillary in the presence of smaller polymers. The combination of gravitational sedimentation and the depletion attraction induced between the spheres and the wall tightly confined the spheres to a 2D layer, in which we have been able to deduce the sphere-wall gap from fitting measured diffusivities to a hydrodynamic theory.21? ,22
The depletion attraction between the spheres induced by the polymers drives them into F-X coexistence at colloid concentrations c very much lower than that needed for 2D crystallization (c = 0.67) in the absence of polymers. A freevolume theory15 adapted to our semi-grand canonical system gives a good account of the F-X coexistence boundary.
At high polymer concentration, the depletion attraction drives the formation of ramified clusters that are locally crystalline, confirming a previous simulation.23 However, the cluster size distribution and cluster growth dynamics show quantitative differences with these simulations, which we speculate as due to particle adhesion and/or the screening hydrodynamic interactions by the wall. Future simulations may explore the validity of these proposals.
The 500-word 1954 letter by Asakura and Oosawa published in this journal14 together with Vrij's later detailed treatment based on the AO picture2 marked the start of modern research into depletion-driven phenomena. A first theoretical account of the phase behavior in colloid-polymer mixtures integrates out the polymeric degrees of freedom and uses an AO potential for the inter-particle interaction.51 Later, a `primitive model' that takes explicit account of the polymers' centre-ofmass degrees of freedom successively predicts polymer partitioning in coexisting phases.4 Its applicability was confirmed by bulk experiments.5 Interestingly, this primitive model uses a semi-grand canonical ensemble19 as a calculational device.
It is gratifying that seven decades from `AO' and three decades from the semi-grand canonical model, we are able to perform experiments in a well-characterized ensemble of this kind, fit our dynamical (diffusion) data by appealing to an AO form of the interaction between particles and wall, Fig. 3, and account for the equilibrium phase behavior using a modified version of the original primitive model, Fig. 4(a).

Appendix A: Approximate estimate of fluid binodal
In the presence of non-adsorbing polymers the cohesive free energy of the hexagonally-ordered crystal can be approximated by calculating the energy required to break the AO `bonds', as in a solid-state physics problem.52 By matching

For simplicity we neglect the excluded volume overlaps in
the fluid (one can show that they are small) and tacitly omit
the V1 terms which contribute only a common constant to the chemical potentials. Since at coexistence the chemical potentials of the fluid and crystal are the same, µ0 can be obtained from the known fluid coexistence composition in the
absence of added polymer, viz. Eq. (A2) should be verified by c  0.670 at p = 0. Solving Eq. (A2) (with z = 6) for c as a function of p then provides an estimate of the fluid binodal, shown for the present system as the chained line in Fig. 2.

Appendix B: Hydrodynamic interactions

We present heuristic arguments that in a wall-bound cluster
containing N particles, the wall `screens' the hydrodynamic interactions such that the cluster mobility  1/N, at least in the scaling limit. We start with the familiar result that a point force f in an unbounded fluid generates a velocity field v at a distance r with (Oseen tensor)?

In this I is the unit tensor, r^ = r/r with r = |r|, and µ is the fluid viscosity. Similarly, Blake and Chwang showed that a
point force at a height h above the wall generates a flow field which behaves to leading-order in far-field as?

v

(B2)

Here, the no-slip boundary condition is coincident with the
z = 0 plane, and r = (x, y) is now the in-plane distance between the point (x, y, z) where the velocity is measured and the point (0, 0, h) where the force is applied. Crucially, according to Eq. (B2), for z  h the far-field decays as 1/r3 rather than 1/r as in Eq. (B1) for an unbounded fluid.53
At this point we recall that the mobility of a fractal cluster is essentially determined by the behavior of 1/rinj where the average is taken over all pairs of particles in the cluster,?
and according to the above we should take n = 1 for freelysuspended clusters or n = 3 for wall-bound clusters. In terms

of the pair distribution function g(r)  r df-d,

(B3)

where R  N1/df is the cut-off in g(r). But this only holds when the integral in the numerator is dominated by this cutoff, which requires df > n. Plainly this is the case for freelysuspended clusters (unless they happen to be fractal dust with df < 1), and so one expects that the cluster mobility  N-1/df. This scaling behavior has been widely confirmed,? ? ? and corresponds to the fact that the flow field is screened from the interior of the cluster. For wall-bound clusters though, it is not the case that the integral in the numerator in Eq. (B3) is dominated by the upper limit since that would require df > 3 which is impossible in d = 2 dimensions. Hence one concludes (perhaps a little tentatively!) that hydrodynamic interactions should be negligible in far-field for wall-bound clusters, or in other words the flow field, already screened by the wall, is not further significantly reduced in the interior of the cluster. It follows that the frictional drag should be extensive in the number of particles, and the cluster mobility should scale as  1/N as claimed.
This conclusion obviously demands numerical verification, using Stokesian dynamics or similar methods.? ? ? For now though, we close with a couple of remarks higlighting the subtleties of this hydrodynamic problem. First, it is interesting to note that the mobilities of individual particles are in a sense decoupled from the hydrodynamic interactions, since the former are sensitive to the gap between the particles and the wall (see section IV A), which can be made arbitrarily small, whereas the latter are essentially controlled by the heights of the particle centres above the wall which are limited by the particle radii. Second, whilst the presence of the wall couples the rotational and translational modes, in a cluster the rotational modes are partly supressed if the particles are mutually hindered from all rolling in the same direction (essentially as a non-trivial consequence of the near-field hydrodynamics). So, it seems doubtful that the individual particle friction coefficients are simply additive, but this may not necessarily change the extensivity of the overall cluster drag coefficient.
