## Abstract

Decision trees and their ensembles are very popular models of supervised machine learning. In this paper we merge the ideas underlying decision trees, their ensembles and FCA by proposing a new supervised machine learning model which can be constructed in polynomial time and is applicable for both classification and regression problems. Specifically, we first propose a polynomial-time algorithm for constructing a part of the concept lattice that is based on a decision tree. Second, we describe a prediction scheme based on a concept lattice for solving both classification and regression tasks with prediction quality comparable to that of state-of-the-art models.
