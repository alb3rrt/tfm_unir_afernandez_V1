Also plays a major role for the platforms to manage their data in such a way that data redundancy is minimized. This paper emphasizes improving the user experience for the platform by efficiently managing data. Keeping in mind all the new age requirements, especially after COVID-19 the sudden surge in subscription has led the stakeholders to try new things to lead the OTT market. Collection of shows being the root of the tree here, this paper improvises the currently existing branches via various tables and suggests some new features on how the data collected can be utilized for introducing new and much-required query results for the consumer.
