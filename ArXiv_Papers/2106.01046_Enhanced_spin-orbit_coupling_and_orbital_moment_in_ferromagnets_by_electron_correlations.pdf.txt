In atomic physics, the Hund rule says that the largest spin and orbital state is realized due to the interplay of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the Coulomb interactions. Here, we show that in ferromagnetic solids the effective SOC and the orbital magnetic moment can be dramatically enhanced by a factor of 1/[1-(2U  -U -JH )0], where U and U  are the on-site Coulomb interaction within the same oribtals and between different orbitals, respectively, JH is the Hund coupling, and 0 is the average density of states. This factor is obtained by using the two-orbital as well as five-orbital Hubbard models with SOC. We also find that the spin polarization is more favorable than the orbital polarization, being consistent with experimental observations. This present work provides a fundamental basis for understanding the enhancements of SOC and orbital moment by Coulomb interactions in ferromagnets, which would have wide applications in spintronics.

Introduction--The Hund's rule in atomic physics says that the state with both the largest spin moment and the largest orbital moment is realized in an atom, required by the minimum of the Coulomb repulsive energy. The similar picture was obtained in the magnetic impurity systems. In the Anderson impurity model, the spin magnetic moment of impurities is developed due to the large on-site Coulomb interaction U [1]. In 1964, the extended Anderson impurity model with degenerate orbitals has been studied, where the role of U and the Hund coupling JH has been addressed [2, 3]. Forty years ago, Yafet also studied the Anderson impurity model within HartreeFock approximation and found that the on-site Coulomb interaction of impurities can enhance the effective SOC in the spin-flip cross section [4]. Later, Fert and Jaoul applied this result to study the anomalous Hall effect due to magnetic impurities [5]. The relation between the onsite Coulomb interaction U and the effective spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in magnetic impurity systems has also been discussed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations [6] and the quantum Monte Carlo simulations [7].
In these years, one of the fast developing areas in condensed matter physics is spintronics [8, 9]. It aims to manipulate the spin rather than the charge degree of freedom of electrons to design the next-generation electronic devices with small size, faster calculating ability, and lower energy consumption. SOC, as one of the key ingredients in spintronics, is related to many significant physical phenomena and novel matter [10]. In addition to the magnetic anisotropy [8, 11], SOC plays an important role in the phenomena such as anomalous Hall effect [12], spin Hall effect associated with the spincharge conversion [13­16], topological insulators [17­21], skymions [22­24] and so on. To design better spintronic

devices, a large SOC is usually required. As SOC is a relativistic effect in quantum mechanics, it is often small in many materials. A key issue is what factors can affect the magnitude of the SOC in solids.
On the other hand, the orbital moment in the FeCo nanogranules was experimentally shown to be about three times larger than that in bulk FeCo, as a result of the enhanced Coulomb interaction in the FeCo/insulator interface [25], because the Coulomb interaction in the FeCo/insulator interface is expected to be larger than that in the ferromagnetic FeCo bulk. In addition, a large Coulomb interaction up to 10 eV was discussed in Fe thin films in the experiment [26]. The spin polarization in the Hubbard model with Rashba SOC can also be enhanced by the on-site Coulomb interaction U [27]. Recently, in the two-dimensional magnetic topological insulators PdBr3 and PtBr3, the DFT calculations show that the band gap and the SOC can be strongly enhanced by the Coulomb interaction [28].
Inspired by recent experimental and numerical results on the enhanced SOC due to the Coulomb interaction in strongly correlated electronic systems, here we develop a theory on the relation between SOC and Coulomb interaction in ferromagnets. By a two-orbital Hubbard model with SOC, we find that the effective SOC and orbital magnetic moment in ferromagnets can be enhanced by a factor of 1/[1-(2U -U -JH )0], where U and U  are the on-site Coulomb interaction within the same oribtals and between different orbitals, respectively, JH is the Hund coupling, and 0 is the average density of states. The same factor has also been obtained for the five-orbital Hubbard model with degenerate bands. Our theory can be viewed as the realization of Hund's rule in ferromagnets.
Two-orbital Hubbard model with SOC--Let us consider

2

a two-orbital Hubbard model, where only a pair of orbitals with opposite orbital magnetic quantum numbers m (-1 and 1, or -2 and 2) are considered. Thus, the Hamiltonian can be written as

H=

kmnkm + U

where km is the energy of electron with wave vector k, orbital m, and spin  (, ) [29], U and U  are the on-
site Cuolomb repulsion within the orbital m and between different orbitals m and m, respectively, JH is the Hund coupling, and nkm(nim) represents the particle number with wave vector k (site index i), orbital m and spin .
For simplicity, we consider four degenerate energy bands,
which are lifted by an external magnetic field h and the
Ising-type SOC [5]:

where so is the SOC constant, k is the electron energy without external magnetic filed and SOC. Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we have nimnim  nim nim + nim nim - nim nim . Assuming the system is homogeneous, the occupation number nim is independent of lattice site i: nim  nm , and through Fourier transformation i nim = k nkm, the Halmiltonian in Eq.(1) can be diagonalized as:

We define the spin polarization per site as sz = µB( nm - nm + nm¯  - nm¯  ), and the orbital polarization per site as lz = mµB ( nm - nm¯  + nm - nm¯  ). Here we should remark that the so-defined orbital polarization from itinerant electrons on different orbitals with SOC differs from the conventional orbital moments of atoms that are usually quenched owing to the presence of the crystal fields in transition metal ferromagnets. Introduce the particle numbers of the parallel (np) and antiparallel (nap) states of the spin  and orbital m: np= nm + nm¯  , nap= nm¯  + nm . Then the energy E~km can be written as

Spin polarization-- It is noted that without external

magnetic field h and SOC so, the four energy bands with spin  ( and ) and orbital m (for example 1 and -1)

are degenerate, and the occupation numbers nap = np. In

as

(PM) state (h = 0), f (~km) can be expanded according to h, which is a small value compared to Fermi energy,

and nap = np, sz = µB k[f (~P M,km) - f (~P M,km) + f (~P M,km¯ ) - f (~P M,km¯ )] = 0. Up to the linear order of

This condition can be taken as an extension of Stoner cri-

terion in the presence of SOC in itinerant ferromagnets.

Orbital polarization-- Similarly, the orbital polariza-

tion can be expressed as lz = µB m( nm - nm¯  +

µB m N

k[f (~km)-f (~km¯ )+f (~km)-

be regarded as a small value [5], so f (~km) can be expanded according to so, and when so = 0, nap = np,

the zero-order term is zero. To the linear order of so,

the orbital polarization gives

One may note that the orbital polarization discussed here [Eq. (8)] is totally induced by the SOC, which can be enhanced by increasing U  or decreasing U and JH , we will discuss this in detail. In the absence of the SOC, such an orbital polarization is absent according to Eq. (8). The instability condition of orbital polarization would be:

(2U  - U - JH )0 > 1.

The detailed derivation is given in the Supplementary Information.
Five-orbital Hubbard model with SOC--Our theory can be easily extended to the five-orbital Hubbard model with degenerate bands, and the detailed derivation is given in the Supplementary Information. For the five-orbital case, the instability condition of the spin polarization becomes as (U + 4JH )0 > 1. The same expression has been obtained for the presence of localized spin moment in the Anderson impurity model with degenerate orbitals [2, 3]. The obtained instability condition of the orbital polarization is (2U  - U - JH )0 > 1, which is the same as Eq.(10) for the two-orbital case. In the five-orbital case, the effective SOC and the orbital magnetic moment can also be enhanced by a factor of 1/[(2U -U -JH )0], that is the same enhancement factor as in the two-orbital case.
Discussion--The comparison between our theory, the Stoner model and the Anderson impurity model is shown in Table I. It is interesting to note that the instability conditions of sz between our five-orbital Hubbard model with SOC and the Anderson impurity model are the same, while the obtained effective SOC esffo between the two models are different. Comparing Eqs.(7) and (10), which are the spin and orbital instability conditions of the two-orbital model in Table I, one may note that the condition of the orbital spontaneous polarization is more stringent than that of the spin spontaneous polarization. The phase diagram of the spin and orbital spontaneous polarizations as a function of the inverse of average density of state 1/0 and the Coulomb interaction U obtained with Eqs. (7) and (10) is depicted in Fig. 1. Considering the relation U = U  + 2JH and the reasonable values of U = 4  7 eV in the 3d transitional metal oxides [31], for 3d electrons, JH = 1, U  = 5, U = 7 eV are a set of reasonable values, for simplicity we keep the ratio U : U  : JH = 7 : 5 : 1 in Eq.(9), and the shaded area with blue (red) solid lines indicates

The black dotted line indicates the Stoner criterion of the spin spontaneous polarization, which is obtained by the single orbital Hubbard model.
the spin (orbital) spontaneous polarization. The Stoner criterion of the spin spontaneous polarization based on the single orbital Hubbard model is also plotted in Fig. 1 for a comparison. The results show that the area of orbital spontaneous polarization is enclosed in the area of spin spontaneous polarization. In other words, it is more stringent to have the orbital spontaneous polarization, which is consistent with the fact that the orbital spontaneous polarization is rarely observed in experiments.
The relation between the electron correlations U , U  and JH and the spin polarization sz in Eq. (6) and the

4

orbital polarization lz in Eq. (8) can be understood by the energy terms in Eq. (4). For a given state with orbital m and spin , according to the principle of minimum energy, in order to compensate the Coulomb interaction U , the occupancy number nm will decrease, which will increase sz and decrease lz. To compensate the Coulomb interaction U , the occupancy numbers nm¯  and nm¯  will equally decrease, which will have no effect on sz and increase lz. To compensate the Hund interaction JH , the occupancy number nm¯  will increase, which will increase sz and decrease lz. The above argument by Eq. (4) is consistent with the obtained enhancement factor 1/[1 - (2U  - U - JH )]0 for lz in Eq. (8), where U and JH will decrease lz and U  will increase lz. The same argument by Eq. (4) is also consistent with the calculated enhancement factor 1/[1 - (U + JH )]0 for sz in Eq. (6), where U and JH will increase sz and U  has no effect on sz.
Application--Equation (9) shows that Coulomb interactions can enhance the effective SOC. Recently, for magnetic topological insulators PdBr3 and PtBr3, it is found that the energy gap increases with the increase of Coulomb interaction [28]. In these topological materials, the energy gap is opened due to the SOC, and the enhancement of SOC by the Coulomb interaction can be naturally obtained by Eq.(9). In addition, since the magnetic optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and the Faraday effect are determined by the SOC, the experimentally observed large Faraday effect in metal fluoride nanogranular films [32] and the predicted large MOKE at Fe/insulator interfaces [33] can also be understood by the effect of Coulomb interaction as revealed by Eq.(9), because the Coulomb interaction becomes important with the decreased screening effect at the interfaces. It is noted that the Hubbard model with SOC has been extensively studied, where the SOC can induce the Dzyaloshinski-Moriya interaction and the pesudo-dipolar interaction [29, 34­ 45].
The orbital magnetic moment can also be enhanced by Coulomb interaction, as given by Eq.(8). In the recent experiment, the orbital magnetic moment in FeCo nanogranules is observed to be three times larger than that of FeCo bulk [25]. Using Eq.(8), the ratio of the orbital magnetic moment without the Coulomb interaction lz(U = 0) to the orbital magnetic moment with finite U lz(U ) can be approximately written as:

lz(U ) lz (0)

=

1 - (2U 

1 -U

- JH )0 .

(11)

As the Coulomb interactions can be approximately neglected in the metal bulk, and become important in the metal/insulator interfaces, lz(0) and lz(U ) can represent the orbital moment of FeCo bulk and nanogranules, respectively. To reproduce the experimental ratio of orbital magnetic moment between FeCo nanogranules and bulk we may take, lz(U )/lz(0) = 3, the fitted value U = 4.4 eV

is obtained by Eq.(11), which is reasonable for 3d transition metals. In the fitting, we use the approximation in the DFT calculation, to keep JH = 0 eV, U = U . 0 = 0.15 (1/eV) is obtained by DFT calculation for the FeCo interface, where 0 is approximately estimated as the density of states at Fermi level. Therefore, Eq.(11) can be used to qualitatively explain the enhancement of orbital magnetic moment for the FeCo nanogranules in the experiment.
Conclusion-- A two-orbital Hubbard model with SOC, we show that the orbital polarization and the effective SOC in ferromagnets are enhanced by a factor of 1/[1 - (2U  - U - JH )0], where U and U  are the on-site Coulomb interaction within the same orbitals and between different orbitals, respectively, JH is the Hund coupling, and 0 is the average density of states. The same factor is obtained for the five-orbital Hubbard model with degenerate bands. Our theory can be viewed as the realization of Hund's rule in ferromagnets. The theory can be applied to understand the enhanced band gap due to SOC in magnetic topological insulators, and the enhanced orbital magnetic moment in ferromagnetic nanogranules in a recent experiment. In addition, our results reveal that it is more stringent to have the orbital spontaneous polarization than the spin spontaneous polarization, which is consistent with experimental observations. As the electronic interaction in some twodimensional (2D) systems can be controlled experimentally [46], according to our theory, the enhanced SOC, spin and orbital magnetic moments are highly expected to be observed in these 2D systems. This present work not only provides a fundamental basis for understanding the enhancements of SOC in some magnetic materials, but also sheds light on how to get a large SOC through hybrid spintronic structures.
