The new two-dimensional (2D) kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 has attracted much recent attention due to the coexistence of superconductivity, charge order, topology and kagome physics [133]. A key issue in this field is to unveil the unique reconstructed electronic structure, which successfully accommodates different orders and interactions to form a fertile ground for emergent phenomena. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) evidence for two distinct band reconstructions in CsV3Sb5. The first one is characterized by the appearance of new electron energy band at low temperature. The new band is theoretically reproduced when the three dimensionality of the charge order [21-23] is considered for a band-folding along the out-of-plane direction. The second reconstruction is identified as a surface induced orbital-selective shift of the electron energy band. Our results provide the first evidence for the three dimensionality of the charge order in single-particle spectral function, highlighting the importance of long-range out-of-plane electronic correlations in this layered kagome superconductor. They also point to the feasibility of orbital-selective control of the band structure via surface modification, which would open a new avenue for manipulating exotic phenomena in this system, including superconductivity.

CsV3Sb5 is a member of the new class of AV3Sb5 (A= K, Rb, Cs) kagome superconductors [1-36] with a layered crystal structure (Fig. 1a). The V sublattice forms a perfect kagome net (Fig. 1b), which is interwoven with a hexagonal net of Sb atoms in the same plane (Fig. 1a). This V3Sb layer is then bounded above and below by Sb honeycomb lattices and Cs hexagonal lattices (Fig. 1a). The corresponding three dimensional (3D) Brillouin zone (BZ) is shown in Fig. 1c. Due to the layered crystal structure, a projected 2D BZ is often used for simplicity (see Fig. 1c,d; the high symmetry points are marked as  andM). While topological states and electron correlation effects are naturally expected from the kagome net in CsV3Sb5, the existence of a charge density wave (CDW) order below TCDW=94K and a superconducting ground state (Tc=2.5K) has further increased the richness of this system at low temperature [2-33].

In order to track the evolution of the electronic structure, the sample was cleaved at a temperature above the CDW transition (T>TCDW) and slowly cooled down towards a low temperature (T=25K). As shown in Fig. 1e, the electron-like band around moves up towards the Fermi energy (EF) (marked by blue stars), while the hole-like band aroundM remains at almost the same energy (marked by red hexagons). For simplicity, we label these two bands as  band and  band, respectively (Fig. 1e). However, the above band evolution is distinct from the electronic structure measured on a sample directly cleaved at the low temperature (25K). As shown in Fig.1f, the upward energy shift of the  band around is absent. Instead, a clear electron-like band bottom is observed at a much deeper binding energy (around -0.8eV at the point). The different band structures probed at the same temperature (25K) indicate the existence of two distinct band reconstructions in this material system.

To avoid possible complications during the cooling process, we first compare the band structure of two CsV3Sb5 samples cleaved at 115K (T>TCDW) and 25K (T<TCDW), respectively. The electron energy bands in the normal state (T>TCDW) are well captured by the corresponding DFT calculations [2] (Fig. 4a). However, more electronic features seem to appear at low temperature with a prominent band reconstruction around (Fig. 2b). A careful examination of the energy distribution curves (EDCs) reveals a new electron-like band (marked by the red circles in Fig. 2d) in addition to the original  band (marked by the blue triangles in Fig. 2c,d). This is quantitatively confirmed by the temperature dependence of the EDC at As shown in Fig. 2e, the EDC peak from the  band (marked by the blue arrow) shows little change with temperature while an additional peak from the new band only appears at low temperature (around -0.8eV; marked by the red arrow; also see Supplemental Materials Fig. S1). For simplicity, we label the new electron-like band observed at low temperature as ' band, hereafter. We also summarize the original  band (blue) and the low temperature ' band (red) in Fig. 2f.
After establishing the temperature induced band reconstruction, we next investigate the other type of band evolution observed during the cooling process. To isolate the tuning parameters, we fix the temperature at 115K and measure the band structure as a function of time (Fig. 3). We track the energy position of  () band bottom (top) by the EDC peak at (M), as illustrated in Fig. 3a,b (d,e). The systematic time evolution of the EDC peak is shown in Fig. 3c (f). It is clear that the  band moves up towards the EF, while the  band shows little change as a function of time. The overall band evolution reproduces that observed during the cooling process (Fig. 1e). Therefore, this type of band reconstruction is associated with time but not temperature.
We next discuss the origins of these two distinct band reconstructions in this system. First, we consider the band reconstruction as a function of temperature. The coexistence of both  and ' bands at low temperature seems to suggest a band splitting, which has been reported in magnetic materials [37]. However, CsV3Sb5 does not exhibit any resolvable magnetic order [2]. Moreover, a band splitting would change the energy position of the original  band, which is inconsistent with the experiment. Electron-phonon coupling can also give rise to a replica band at a deeper energy [38]. But the energy separation between  band and ' band is greater than 300meV, which is much higher than the phonon

energies in this material system. A surface reconstruction has been reported to account for additional shadow bands in layered-materials [39]. But such a surface reconstruction has not been observed in CsV3Sb5 yet. It also remains unclear how surface reconstruction can give rise to the ' band at a deeper energy. On the other hand, we find that the temperature induced band reconstruction can be well reproduced by considering an out-of-plane band folding induced by the 3D charge order in CsV3Sb5 [17,21-24]. While the band structure of CsV3Sb5 is primarily quasi-2D, a significant Kz difference can be identified between  and A in the 3D BZ (Fig. 4a), where the electron-like band around A locates at a much deeper energy. As shown in Fig. 4c, when the unit cell along the out-of-plane direction is doubled by the 3D charge order, the ALH plane in the BZ will be folded to the MK plane. As such, the deep electron-like band along L-A-L (Fig. 4a) will be folded to the M--M direction (Fig. 4b), giving rise to the
5

' band observed in the experiment. We note that the DFT calculation also shows a hole-like band close to the bottom of the ' band. However, this band disappears when in-plane component of the charge order [19] or electron correlation [40] is considered in the calculations. In this sense, our results reveal the direct coupling of the real space 3D charge order [21,22] to the single particle spectral function of the system. We note that electronic states dressed by the long-range out-of-plane correlation of charge order in CsV3Sb5 may have important implications. For instance, high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates shows 3D superconducting coherence with primarily 2D electronic band structures [41], and the experimental identification of 3D charge order revealed an intimate link between superconductivity and charge order beyond simple competition [42]. In the current case, 3D superconductivity is realized in the quasi-2D kagome metal [2-11,33], where 3D charge order also appears and dresses the quasi-2D electronic structure. It would be interesting to explore the nature of the out-of-plane interaction that stabilizes the 3D ordering tendencies in CsV3Sb5 and related quasi-2D kagome superconductors.

The origin of the band reconstruction as a function of time is necessarily associated with changes of sample surface; however, the observed band evolution is not due to a trivial aging effect. Sample aging typically broadens the measured spectrum but should not shift the energy of the band. The different evolution between  band and  band observed in the experiment is also distinct from a simple band filling with carriers, which would give rise to a rigid band shift. To deepen the understanding, orbitalresolved DFT calculations have been carried out. As shown in Fig. 4d,e, the  band is dominated by Sb porbitals, whereas the  band is mainly from V d-orbitals. Therefore, the time-dependent band evolution represents an orbital-selective energy shift of the electron energy band, which mainly involves the Sb porbitals. This is consistent with a recent proposal considering an orbital-selective hybridization of hole carriers from surface vacancies of Cs atoms [11], where the Sb pz-orbitals pointing towards the Cs atoms are mainly involved. In the calculation, the  band shows an upward shift in energy with increasing Cs vacancies, whereas the  band remains unchanged [11]. This result is well-aligned with our experimental observation, if we assume the fresh sample surface loses Cs atoms and forms Cs vacancies as a function of time. The formation of Cs vacancies on the cleaved sample surface has also been observed by STM measurements. Most importantly, this orbital-selectively reconstructed band structure could in turn enhance the superconductivity and suppress the charge order [11]. It indicates the feasibility of orbitalselective control of the band structure and physical properties in CsV3Sb5 via surface modification.
The last thing to discuss is the absence of the ' band when the sample is slowly cooled down to a low temperature below the charge ordering transition (Fig. 1e). One possibility is that the accumulated Cs vacancies break the long-range coherence of the 3D charge order on a few top-layers of the sample. STM results show that the pure long-range 2X2X2 charge order mainly appears on the surface region with periodic Cs atoms, whereas the Sb-terminated region is dominated by a 1X4 surface modulation [20,21]. If the ' band is induced by the 3D 2X2X2 charge order, then it may disappear on the sample surface without periodic Cs atoms.
Our work has identified two distinct band reconstructions in CsV3Sb5. The new band observed at low temperature is reproduced by considering a coupling with the long-range out-of-plane correlation of the 3D charge order. The orbital-selective band reconstruction observed as a function of time, on the other hand, is consistent with an orbital-selective hybridization of hole carriers from surface vacancies. It thus

provides a unique window to manipulate the electronic structure and associated physical phenomena in this new class of materials. Future studies exploring surface manipulation with different dopants [43,44] are motivated by our result.
Methods Single crystals of CsV3Sb5 were grown by the self-flux method as described elsewhere [1,2]. The samples were cleaved in-situ with a base pressure of 6 X 10-11torr. The photoemission measurements were carried out at our lab-based ARPES system with 21.2eV photons. The energy resolution was set at 5meV for the measurements. The Fermi level was referenced to that of a polycrystalline Au in electrical contact with the samples. DFT calculations were performed without spin-orbit-coupling in VASP v5.4.4 [45-47] using identical parameters to a recent study [2]. The calculated Fermi level was set to the DFT value and the orbital projections were determined using LOBSTER [48,49] for improved fidelity. While recent work has demonstrated a slight shift of the Fermi level relative to the DFT calculation, as well as energy gaps associated with spin-orbit coupling, these small adjustments do not affect the arguments discussed in the current study.
