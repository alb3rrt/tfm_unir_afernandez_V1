## Abstract

Two-dimensional (2D) surface of the topological materials is an attractive channel for the electrical conduction reflecting the linearly-dispersive electronic bands. By applying a reliable systematic thickness t dependent measurement of sheet conductance, here we elucidate the dimensionality of the electrical conduction paths of a Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2. Under the ferromagnetic phase, the 2D conduction path clearly emerges in Co3Sn2S2 thin films, indicating a formation of the Fermi arcs projected from Weyl nodes. Comparison between 3D conductivity and 2D conductance provides the effective thickness of the surface conducting region being estimated to be approximately 20 nm, which is rather thicker than 5 nm in topological insulator Bi2Se3. This large value may come from the narrow gap at Weyl point and relatively weak spin-orbit interaction of the Co3Sn2S2. The emergent surface conduction will provide a pathway to activate quantum and spintronic transport features stemming from a Weyl node in thin-film-based devices.
