## Abstract

We report on systematical optical model (OM) and continuum discretized coupled channel (CDCC) calculations applied to describe the elastic scattering angular distributions of exotic and stable nuclei projectiles on heavy targets. Our optical potential (OP) is composed of the nuclear microscopic double folding SÃ£o Paulo potential (SPP), derived from the nonlocal nature of the interaction, and the Coulomb dipole polarization (CDP) potential, derived from the semiclassical theory of Coulomb excitation. The OP is compared to the trivial equivalent local potential (TELP), extracted from CDCC calculations. The OM and CDCC predictions corroborate each other and account for important differences in the nuclei reaction mechanisms, which are directly related to their structural properties. Thus, OM and CDCC establish a common basis for analyzing or even predicting exotic and stable nuclei reactions.
