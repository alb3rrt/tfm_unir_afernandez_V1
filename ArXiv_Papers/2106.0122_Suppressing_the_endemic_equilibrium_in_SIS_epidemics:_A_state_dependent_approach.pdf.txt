Abstract: This paper considers the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model with an underlying network structure among subpopulations and focuses on the effect of social distancing to regulate the epidemic level. We demonstrate that if each subpopulation is informed of its infection rate and reduces interactions accordingly, the fraction of the subpopulation infected can remain below half for all time instants. To this end, we first modify the basic SIS model by introducing a state dependent parameter representing the frequency of interactions between subpopulations. Thereafter, we show that for this modified SIS model, the spectral radius of a suitably-defined matrix being not greater than one causes all the agents, regardless of their initial sickness levels, to converge to the healthy state; assuming non-trivial disease spread, the spectral radius being greater than one leads to the existence of a unique endemic equilibrium, which is also asymptotically stable. Finally, by leveraging the aforementioned results, we show that the fraction of (sub)populations infected never exceeds half.

1. INTRODUCTION
Spreading processes such as information, diseases, and so on play an outsized role in modern societies. Notably, the ongoing COVID-19 crisis has caused disruption to our daily lives on a scale not seen in decades. Hence, spreading processes have attracted the attention of researchers starting from Bernouli's seminal paper (Bernoulli, 1760), with the key objective being to understand and eradicate (or, at the very least, mitigate) the spread. The literature abounds with relevant models, viz. susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR), susceptibleexposed-infected-recovered (SEIR), etc. The focus of the present paper is on the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model over strongly connected underlying network structure, representing the interactions among subpopulations. Each subpopulation is referred to as an agent.
In the SIS model, an agent is either in the susceptible or infected state. A healthy agent can get infected depending on the infection rate , scaled by the interactions it has with its neighboring agents; in a similar manner, an infected agent recovers based on the healing rate . It is assumed that the total number of agents is constant (Lajmanovich and Yorke, 1976) and sufficiently many. The

latter implies that stochastic effects can be discounted (Anderson and May, 1992). We say that the system is in the healthy state if all the agents are healthy, or equivalently, in the disease-free equilibrium (DFE). If the epidemic remains persistent, we say that the system is in the endemic state.
Stability analysis of SIS models has been a major focus in mathematical epidemiology; see, for instance, (Fall et al., 2007) and (Par´e et al., 2020b) for continuous-time and discrete-time cases, respectively. Similarly, control of SIS models has also received significant attention; see, for instance (Torres et al., 2016; Watkins et al., 2016). We refer the interested readers to (Nowzari et al., 2016) for an overview of these topics. By leveraging the information regarding infection levels of agents, a state feedback strategy for eradicating epidemics has been proposed (Par´e et al., 2020a). The strategy involves boosting the healing rates of all agents, presupposing the availability of medical resources such as vaccinations, drug administration and so on. In the absence of pharmaceutical intervention strategies, policymakers might have weaker objectives.
In this paper, we approach the problem epidemic peak control from the viewpoint of social distancing. Under the situation where the healthcare system is overwhelmed by the wide spread of infections, decreasing the frequency of interactions could be a very effective mitigation technique. In fact, for SIR epidemics such strategies have been designed previously. The work (Morris et al., 2021) using

the SIR model demonstrates that if social distancing is enforced effectively at a proper level and an appropriate timing, the peak of infected population can be reduced. In (Wang et al., 2021), this model is augmented by a multiagent system performing consensus algorithms, where the infected agents may not behave as desired and resilience against such behaviors is sought. To the best of our knowledge, for SIS models, strategies for suppression of epidemics by upper bounding the proportion of infected individuals in a subpopulation with a specific value are not available. We aim to address the same in the present paper.
Contributions: The main contribution of this paper is to devise a control scheme for guaranteeing that the fraction of individuals in a subpopulation who are infected does not exceed half for all time instants. Our approach is as follows: First, we modify the discrete-time SIS model in (Par´e et al., 2020b) by introducing a state dependent parameter. Then, we show that for this modified SIS model, the following properties hold:
(i) The spectral radius of a suitably-defined matrix being not greater than one guarantees convergence to the DFE; see Theorem 1.
(ii) If the spectral radius of the aforementioned matrix is greater than one, then there exists an endemic equilibrium, which has a specific characterization, and is asymptotically stable; see Theorem 2.
(iii) Finally, leveraging the results in Theorems 1 and 2, we show that the fraction of infected individuals in a subpopulation never exceeds half; see Theorem 3.
Outline: The rest of the paper unfolds as follows. The problem being investigated is formally introduced in Section 2. The main results and the accompanying proofs are provided in Section 3, while simulations illustrating our theoretical findings are given in Section 4. Finally, a summary of the paper and some concluding remarks are provided in Section 5.
Notation: Let R+ and Z+ denote the sets of non-negative real numbers and integers, respectively. For any two vectors a, b  Rn, we write a > b if ai > bi for every i  [n]. Let an eigenvalue of matrix A be denoted by (A). Let (A) denote the largest absolute value of an eigenvalue of matrix A, which is also called the spectral radius of A. A diagonal matrix is denoted as diag(·). We use 1 = [1, 1, . . . , 1]T and 0 = [0, 0, . . . , 0]T to denote the vectors of all-ones and all-zeros, respectively. Given a matrix A, A  0 (resp. A 0) indicates that A is negative definite (resp. negative semidefinite).

subpopulation j can infect subpopulation i. The strength of interconnection from agent j to i is captured by the weight aij > 0. Let  > 0 and  > 0 denote the infection and healing rates of each agent, respectively.

Now, the continuous-time dynamics of each agent i  [n]

can be represented as follows (Fall et al., 2007):

x i(t) = (1 - xi(t))

n j=1

aij

where xi is the infection level of agent i and t  R+.

Observe that, since the state xi(t) here denotes fraction of

the subpopulation infected at time t, the state values must

remain in the interval [0, 1] and we restrict our analysis

within this range for all agents.

The discrete-time version of (1) can be obtained by applying Euler's method to (1) as in (Par´e et al., 2020b):

xi(k + 1) = xi(k) + T (1 - xi(k))

where T > 0 is the sampling period.

It is common to denote the basic reproduction number
by R0 = / > 0. It represents the reproduction ability, indicating how many agents an infected agent can infect on average per time step.

2.2 Problem statement
Assuming that there is a non-trivial disease spread. Our goal is to devise a control scheme through social distancing such that the infection levels xi(k) of all subpopulations are bounded from above by 1/2 for all time instants k.

2.3 Modified SIS model with local policy makers

In order to achieve our goal, we modify the system in (2) by introducing an infection reduction parameter, denoted by bi(k)  [0, 1]. This can be interpreted as a parameter provided by a local policymaker who, based on available sickness data, estimates the realtime infection level for agent i and makes preventative decisions. Such decisions, in this context, correspond to reducing the interactions with other agents in the network. Consequently, for each

agent i, the effective infection rate is reduced from  to

bi(k). Hence, the dynamics in (2) can be written as

xi(k + 1) = xi(k) + T bi(k)(1 - xi(k))

n j=1

(3)

Note that bi(k) = 0 indicates that agent i removes all connections with its neighbors, while bi(k) = 1 indicates all connections with neighbors are maintained as in the
nominal case.

2.1 Basic SIS model

In this section, we present a control strategy for guarantee-

Consider a network of n agents, with each agent representing a subpopulation, and suppose that a virus is spreading over this network. Coming into contact with an infectious agent possibly results in an otherwise healthy agent getting infected with the virus. Such a spreading process can be represented by a directed graph G = (V, E), where V = {1, 2, . . . , n} denotes the set of agents and E

ing that, for i  [n], xi(k)  [0, 1/2) for all time instants k. Towards this end, we set the infection reduction parameter for each agent i as bi(k) = 1 - 2xi(k). This indicates that each agent i is asked by its local policymaker to reduce
its contacts by 2xi(k) at each time instant. Substituting this parameter into (3), the dynamics for agent i can be written as

denotes the set of interconnections between the agents. More precisely, E = {(i, j)  V × V | aij = 0}. That is, there is a directed edge from agent j to agent i if a

Since the values that bi(k) takes depend on the infection rate at time instant k, we say that it is a state dependent parameter.

Let x(k) = [x1(k), x2(k), . . . , xn(k)]T . Then, in vector form, (4) can be written as:

x(k + 1) = I + T (I - 2diag(x(k)))(I - diag(x(k)))A

- T I x(k).

(5)

We further simplify this expression as

x(k + 1) = M^ (k)x(k),

(6)

where

M^ (k) = M - B(k)A,

(7)

M = I + T A - T I,

(8)

B(k) = T diag(x(k)) 3I - 2diag(x(k)) . (9)

We need the following assumptions for our analysis.
Assumption 1. The underlying graph G is strongly connected.

Note that the adjacency matrix A is irreducible if and only if the underlying graph G is strongly connected.
Assumption 2. For every i  [n], we have xi(0)  (0, 1/2). Assumption 3. T is sufficiently small.

Assumption 2 ensures that when the control based on infection reduction starts, less than half of the subpopulation in any agent is infected. Assumption 3 is a technical assumption on the sampling period.
We need the following definitions in the sequel.
Definition 1. The system (5) is said to reach the disease free equilibrium (DFE) if i  [n], limk xi(k) = 0. Also it is said to reach an endemic equilibrium if the states converge to a positive constant, i.e, i  [n], limk xi(k) = xi , where 0 < xi < 1.
We now present our main results whose proofs are given in the Appendix.
Theorem 1. Consider system (5) under Assumptions 1­3. If (M )  1, then the DFE is asymptotically stable with the domain of attraction [0, 1/2)n.

Theorem 1 establishes that as long as (M )  1, our control scheme achieves convergence to the healthy state, irrespective of whether the agents are initially healthy or sick. Moreover, simulations indicate that the smaller the spectral radius of M is, the faster is the convergence to the healthy state; see Fig. 1. We note that R0 = 0.5 indicates (M ) < 1 while R0 = 1 indicates (M ) = 1 in the simulation.
It is natural to ask what the behavior of system (5) is when (M ) > 1. We analyse the same next. As a first step, we introduce the following assumption.

Fig. 1. Time responses for xi(k) with different R0

Proof : Based on Assumptions 1, 4 and the PerronFrobenius theorem (Meyer, 2000), it follows that (A) = 1. Let x(A) be the eigenvector for the eigenvalue (A). Then

M x(A) = [I + T A - T I] x(A)

= [1 + T ((A) - )] x(A).

Then, (M ) = 1 + T ((A) - ) and thus (M ) = 1 +

T ((A) - ) = 1 + T ( - ). We have (M ) > 1 if

and only if R0 > 1 (i.e.,  > ).



Theorem 2. Consider system (5) under Assumptions 1­ 4. If (M ) > 1, then there exists a unique endemic equilibrium x · 1 > 0, where

x

=

3R0

-

R02 4R0

+ 8R0 .

(10)

Moreover, the endemic equilibrium x · 1 is asymptotically

stable with the domain of attraction [0, 1/2)n \ {0}.

Theorem 2 states that the reproduction number being greater than one gives rise to an endemic behavior. That is, the epidemic becomes a "fact of life" for the community.
We have so far shown that with bi(k) = 1 - 2xi(k), the endemic equilibrium x < 1/2 and thus limk xi(k) < 1/2. In the following theorem, we would like to show for all k  Z+, xi(k) is upper bounded by 1/2.
Theorem 3. Consider the system dynamics in (4) under Assumptions 1­4. Then, for i  [n], we have xi(k) < 1/2 at all times k  Z+.
In words, Theorem 3 guarantees that the proposed control strategy ensures that the fraction of infected individuals in a subpopulation never exceeds half. Hence, the burden on the healthcare facilities remains more manageable.

4. NUMERICAL EXAMPLE
We provide numerical examples to illustrate our results. Networks with 100 agents were generated by randomly placing agents having the communication radius of r = 50 in the area of 100 × 100. For agents i and j that can communicate, select the weight 0 < aij < 1. The initial state xi(0) is randomly chosen from (0, 1/2), and T = 0.01. We confirmed that Assumptions 1, 2 and 4 hold.

asymptotically to the DFE for this case as well.

steps: we first establish the existence and uniqueness of Let

the endemic equilibrium. Subsequently, we establish, for all non-zero initial conditions, asymptotic convergence to the said equilibrium.
Step 1: Existence/Uniqueness of the endemic equilibrium By (5), an equilibrium x = [x1, x2, . . . , xn]T satisfies x = I + T (I - 2diag(x))(I - diag(x))A - T I x.

g() = 1 + 3R0x - 2R0(x)2 - 1 + 3R0x - 2R0x2 = 3R0x( - 1) - 2R0x2( - 1)( + 1) = R0x( - 1)(3 - 2x - 2x).
Since x  1 and  > 1, we have
g()  R0x( - 1)(1 - 2x) > 0.

Hence, it follows that

Thus, from (18), we have

(I - R0A) x = 2R0diag(x)diag(x)Ax-3R0diag(x)Ax. Furthermore, we have

x = H-1(x)R0Ax

By exchanging the roles of x and x·1, by a similar analysis as before, we obtain x  x · 1. This implies x = x · 1, thus concluding the proof of uniqueness.

Step 2: Stability of the endemic equilibrium

First, note that any equilibrium x of (4) satisfies:

x = x + T (1 - 2x)(1 - x) ·

Since, by Assumption 4,

since

we have

(1 - 2x)(1 - x) -  = 0.

Let, for all i  [n], yi(k) = xi(k) - x and yi(k) = yi(k + 1) - yi(k). Substituting xi(k) = yi(k) + x into (4) yields 5

We note that (23) holds since sgn(ym(k))ym2 (k)  ym2 (k),

(24) holds since for every j, yj(k)sgn(ym(k))  |yj(k)|,

and (25) holds because for every j, |yj(k)|  |ym(k)| and

|ym(k)| = V (xmax(k))x. Since |ym(k)| = |xm(k) - x|,

we

that

From (20), we know that T ((1 - 2x)(1 - x) - ) x = 0.

Thus we have

2|ym(k)|2 + (4x - 3)|ym(k)| = |ym(k)|(2|ym(k)| + 4x - 3). Since 0 < |ym(k)| < 1 - x,
4x - 3 < 2|ym(k)| + 4x - 3 < 2x - 1. Since x < 0.5, 2x - 1 < 0, and thus

Since

exists.

Hence,

consider

tion

V (xi(k))

and

V (xmax(k))

=

max(V (xi(k))) and it is immediate that V (xi(k)) is posi-

i[n]

tive for every xi(k) = x. Hence, for i  [n], we have

|yi(k)| = V (xi(k))x  V (xmax(k))x.

(22)

Let V (xi(k)) = V (xi(k + 1)) - V (xi(k)). Thus

V (xi(k))

sgn(yi(k))yi

(k).

Since 0 < |yi(k)| < 1, from (21) it can be seen that

|yi(k)| < T +T |(1-2x)(1-x)|+2T +T |4x-3|

Since T  and T  are sufficiently small, due to As-
sumption 2, it follows that |yi(k)| is sufficiently small. Furthermore, we know that sgn(yi(k + 1)) = sgn(yi(k)) unless yi(k)  0. Therefore, for all yi(k) = 0, we obtain

2|ym(k)|2 + (4x - 3)|ym(k)| < 0.
Hence, V (xm(k)) < 0. Therefore, from (Vidyasagar, 2002), it follows that the system converges asymptotically to the endemic equilibrium x, thus completing the proof.

Proof of Theorem 3: We first consider the case where
R0  1. Based on Assumptions 1­3 and the results in Theorem 1, for an initial state 0 < xi(0) < 1/2, it asymptotically converges to 0. Define xmax(k) = max{xi(k)}, i  [n]. Then based on (4), we have

xi(k + 1) = xi(k) + T (1 - 2xi(k))(1 - xi(k))

Suppose, without loss of generality, that |yi(k)| achieves the maximum value for some node, say m. Therefore,

it follows that V (xm(k)) = V (xmax(k)) and |ym(k)| = V (xmax(k))x. Based on (21), we obtain

The inequality (26) is due to xj(k)  xmax(k) and Assumption 4, whereas inequality (27) follows due to the
fact that the assumption R0  1 implies    and, due to 1 - 2xi(k) < 1. Inequality (28) follows due to xi(k)  xmax(k) while inequality (29) is immediate. The (29) indicates that for every i  [n] and xi(k) = 0, we have
xi(k + 1) < xmax(k) < xmax(0) < 1/2.

Next, we consider the case where R0 > 1. Suppose that

R0 > 1. Since system (4) satisfies Assumptions 1-4, from

Theorem 2, we know that there exists x =

3R0- R20+8R0 4R0

<

1/2. We must study three cases as follows.

Case 1 : the initial local states that satisfies x + c < xi(0) < 1/2, where c is a sufficiently small constant. Due to Theorem 2, such states are decreasing until they reach a sufficiently small neighborhood of x. Hence, for such local

states, k  Z+, we have xi(k) < xi(0) < 1/2.
Case 2 : Suppose that an initial local state satisfies 0 < xi(0) < x - c. Then, such a state is increasing until it reaches asufficiently small neighborhood of x, and then it may reach the region [x - c, x + c], which is less than 1/2, thus we have xi(0) < xi(k) < 1/2, k  Z+.
Case 3 : For initial local states that satisfy x - c  xi(0)  x + c, the monotonicity is unclear. We have shown that

|yi(k)| is sufficiently small and |xi(k+1)-xi(k)| = |yi(k+ 1) - yi(k)| = |yi(k)|. If the states go outside [x - c, x + c] at some time k, they must satisfy case 1 or 2 and then we have xi(k) < 1/2, k  Z+. Thus for all agents with initial local states that satisfy Assumption 2, we have xi(k) < 1/2, k  Z+.
