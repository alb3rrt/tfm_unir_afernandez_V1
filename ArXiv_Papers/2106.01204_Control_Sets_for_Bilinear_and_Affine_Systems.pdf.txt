June 3, 2021 Abstract. For homogeneous bilinear control systems, the control sets are characterized using a Lie algebra rank condition for the induced systems on projective space. This is based on a classical Diophantine approximation result. For affine control systems, the control sets around the equilibria for constant controls are characterized with particular attention to the question when the control sets are unbounded.

1. Introduction. We will study controllability properties of affine control systems of the form

m
x (t) = Ax(t) + ui(t)(Bix(t) + ci) + d,
i=1

(1.1)

where A, B1, . . . , Bm  Rn×n and c1, . . . , cm, d are vectors in Rn. The controls u = (u1, . . . , um) have values in a set   Rm. The set of admissible controls is U = {u  L(R, Rm) |u(t)   for almost all t } or the set Upc of all piecewise constant functions defined on R with values in .
Controllability properties of bilinear and affine control systems have been intensely studied in the last 50 years. The classical monograph by Mohler [19] contains sufficient conditions for complete controllability and many applications of bilinear control systems. The monograph Elliott [12] emphasizes the use of matrix Lie groups and Lie semigroups and contains a wealth of results on the control of bilinear control systems.
Motivated by the Kalman criterion for controllability of linear systems, an early goal was show that controllability of bilinear control systems (without control restrictions) has an algebraic characterization. This hope did not bear out, in spite of many partial results. The present paper is mainly concerned with the analysis of control sets, that is, maximal subsets of complete approximate controllability in Rn, cf. Definition 2.1 and Colonius and Kliemann [9] for a general theory.
Concerning the literature on controllability properties of affine and bilinear systems, many contributions are based on their analysis via the theory of semigroups in Lie groups, this includes Boothby and Wilson [5], Bonnard [3], Jurdjevic and Kupka [15], Gauthier and Bornard [14], Bonnard, Jurdjevic, Kupka, and Sallet [4], Jurdjevic and Sallet [16], San Martin [22].
The main result of Do Rocio, Santana, and Verdi [11, Theorem 1.3] concerns a connected semigroup S with nonvoid interior in an affine group G = B  V , where V is a finite dimensional vector space and B is a semisimple Lie group that acts transitively on V \ {0}. If the linear action of the canonical projection (S) on B is transitive on V \ {0}, then the affine action of S on V is transitive. This improves an
1

earlier result in [16]. An application to an affine control system of the form

x = Ax + a + uBx + ub with u  R,

(1.2)

where A, B  sl(2, R) and a, b  R2, results in a sufficient controllability criterion in

terms of these parameters.

Answering a question by Sachkov [21], Do Rocio, San Martin, and Santana [10]

prove that systems of the form (1.2) with a = b = 0 and unrestricted control may not be completely controllable on Rn \ {0} while there is no nontrivial proper closed convex cone in Rn which is positively invariant. For the relation to the results in the

present paper see Remark 3.17 and also Proposition 5.14.

Our results on control sets will also yield some results on controllability on Rn. We

do not restrict our attention to the situation where the system semigroup has nonvoid

interior in the system group. Correspondingly, our main results are not based on

methods for semigroups in Lie groups.

In the first part of this paper we discuss control sets for homogeneous bilinear

systems which are a special case of (1.1) with c1 = · · · = cm = d = 0. It is well
known that, for this class of systems, one can separate controllability properties into properties concerning the angular part on the unit sphere Sn-1 and the radial part. In

particular, by Bacciotti and Vivalda [2, Theorem 1] the induced system on projective space Pn-1 is controllable if and only if the induced system on Sn-1 is controllable.

Theorem 3.2 shows that every control set SD with nonvoid interior on Sn-1 induces a control set D on Rn \ {0} given by the cone generated by SD provided that

exponential growth and decay can be achieved. Here we use a classical result on

Diophantine approximations which allows us to require only the accessibility rank condition on Sn-1 in the interior of SD. This result is illustrated by two-dimensional

examples. For systems satisfying the accessibility rank condition on projective space, the control sets on the unit sphere and on Rn \ {0} are characterized in Theorem 3.12

and Theorem 3.15, respectively. We remark that under the accessibility rank condition in R2, a complete description of the control sets and of controllability is given

in Ayala, Cruz, Kliemann, and Laura-Guarachi [1]. Corollary 3.19 characterizes controllability on Rn \ {0} for systems satisfying only the accessibility rank condition on Pn-1 using a recent result by Cannarsa and Sigalotti [7, Theorem 1] which shows that

here approximate controllability implies controllability.

In the second part we analyze control sets for general affine systems and their

relation to equilibria. If the systems linearized about equilibria are controllable,

Theorem 5.6 shows that every connected component of the set of equilibria is con-

tained in a control set. Additional assumptions on spectral properties of the matrices

A(u) = A +

m i=1

allow

to

information.

In

partic-

ular, if 0 is an eigenvalue of A(u0) for some u0  , one finds an unbounded control

set, cf. Theorem 5.13. The main open problem for control sets of affine systems is, if

every control set contains an equilibrium.

The contents of this paper are as follows. Section 2 describes basic properties

of nonlinear control systems and control sets as well as some notation for bilinear

and affine control systems. Section 3 discusses homogeneous bilinear control systems

using their projection to the unit sphere. Section 4 briefly describes equilibria of affine

systems and Section 5 presents results on control sets around such equilibria.

2. Preliminaries. In this section we introduce some terminology and notations for control-affine systems and discuss special cases of affine control systems.

2.1. Control sets. Control-affine systems on a smooth manifold M have the form

m
x (t) = f0(x(t)) + ui(t)fi(x(t)),
i=1
u  U := {u  L(R, Rm) |u(t)   for almost all t  R } ,

(2.1)

where f0, f1, . . . , fm are smooth vector fields on M and the control range   Rm is compact with 0  int (). We assume that for every initial state x  M and every control function u  U there exists a unique solution (t, x, u), t  R, satisfying (0, x, u) = x of (2.1) depending continuously on x. The system with u  0 given by

x (t) = f0(x(t))

(2.2)

is called the uncontrolled system. It generates a continuous flow t on M . For the general theory of nonlinear control systems we refer to Sontag [23] and Jurdjevic [17].
The set of points reachable from x  M and controllable to x  M up to time T > 0 are defined by
O+T (x) := {y  M |there are 0  t  T and u  U with y = (t, x, u) }, O-T (x) := {y  M |there are 0  t  T and u  U with x = (t, y, u) },
resp. Furthermore, the reachable set (or "positive orbit") from x and the set controllable to x (or "negative orbit" of x) are

O+(x) = T >0 O+T (x), O-(x) = T >0 O-T (x),
resp. The system is called locally accessible in x, if O+T (x) and O-T (x) have nonvoid interior for all T > 0 and the system is called locally accessible if this holds in every point x  M . This is guaranteed by the following accessibility rank condition

dim LA {f0, f1, . . . , fm} (x) = dim M for all x  M ;

(2.3)

here LA {f0, f1, . . . , fm} (x) is the subspace of the tangent space TxM corresponding to the vector fields, evaluated in x, in the Lie algebra generated by f0, f1, . . . , fm.
The trajectories for the convex hull of  can be uniformly approximated on bounded intervals by the trajectories for . Furthermore, trajectories for controls in U can be uniformly approximated on bounded intervals by trajectories for piecewise constant controls in Upc.
The following definition introduces subsets of complete approximate controllability which are of primary interest in the present paper.
Definition 2.1. A set D  M is called a control set of system (2.1) if it has the following properties: (i) for all x  D there is a control function u  U such that (t, x, u)  D for all t  0, (ii) for all x  D one has D  O+(x), and (iii) D is maximal with these properties, that is, if D  D satisfies conditions (i) and (ii), then D = D.
A control set D  M is called an invariant control set if D = O+(x) for all x  D. All other control sets are called variant.
If the intersection of two control sets is nonvoid, the maximality property (ii) implies that they coincide. If the system is locally accessible in all x  int (D), then
3

int (D)  O+(x) for all x  D and D = O-(x)  O+(x) for every x  int (D). The control sets for piecewise constant controls in Upc coincide with those for controls in U. For these and further properties of control sets, we refer to Colonius and Kliemann [9, Chapters 3 and 4].
The following lemma shows that the controllable set of system (1.1) coincides with the reachable set of the time reversed system.
Lemma 2.2. Consider together with system (2.1) the time reversed system

m
x (t) = -f0(x(t)) - vi(t)fi(x(t)), v  U .
i=1

(2.4)

We denote by O1+(x) and O1-(x) the reachable set from x and the controllable set to x, determined by the system (2.1), respectively, and by O2+(x) and O2-(x) the reachable set from x and the controllable set to x, determined by the system (2.4), respectively. Then O1+(x) = O2-(x) and O1-(x) = O2+(x).
Proof. For y = (T, x, u)  O1+(x), the absolutely continuous function (t) := (T - t, x, u(T - ·)), t  [0, T ], satisfies (0) = y, (T ) = x. It is a solution of (2.4)
with v(t) := u(T - t), t  [0, T ], since for almost all t  [0, T ]

 (t)

=

d dt

(T

-

t, y, u(T

- ·))

m

= -f0((T - t, y, u(T - ·))) - ui(T - t)fi((T - t, y, u(T - ·))

i=1

m

= -f0((t)) - vi(t)fi((t)).

i=1

Thus O1+(x)  O2-(x). The other inclusions follow analogously. 2.2. Affine and bilinear control systems. Frequently, we abbreviate

m
A(u) := A + uiBi for u   and C := (c1, . . . , cm)  Rn×m,
i=1

hence the columns of C are given by the ci. Then (1.1) can be written as

(2.5)

x (t) = A(u(t))x(t) + Cu(t) + d.

A special case are bilinear control systems obtained for d = 0, i.e.

m
x (t) = Ax(t) + ui(t)(Bix(t) + ci) = A(u(t))x(t) + Cu(t),
i=1

(2.6)

and homogeneous bilinear systems of the form

m
x (t) = Ax(t) + ui(t)Bix(t) = A(u(t))x(t).
i=1

(2.7)

For fixed control u  U (1.1) is a nonautonomous inhomogeneous linear differential equation. Denote by u(t, s)  Rn×n the principal matrix solution, i.e., the solution
of

d dt

u(t,

s)

=

A(u(t))u (t,

s),

u(s, s) = I.

4

The solutions (t, x0, u), t  R, of (1.1) with initial condition (0, x0, u) = x0  Rn are given by
t
(t, x0, u) = u(t, 0)x0 + u(t, s)[Cu(s) + d]ds, t  R,
0
and, in particular, the solutions of (2.7) are

(t, x0, u) = u(t, 0)x0, t  R.

This readily implies for   R

(t, x0, u) = u(t, 0)x0 = (t, x0, u).

(2.8)

3. Control sets for homogeneous bilinear systems. We consider homoge-
neous bilinear control systems of the form (2.7) and describe their control sets.
Since for fixed control u, the corresponding differential equations are homogeneous, their controllability properties can often be split into controllability properties
for the angles and the radii separately; cf., e.g., Colonius and Kliemann [9, Chapter 7]. Denote the projection of Rn to the Euclidean unit sphere Sn-1 by  and the projection to real projective space Pn-1 (obtained by identifying opposite points on
the sphere) by P. For a trajectory of (2.7) define

s(t) := (x(t)) =

x(t) x(t)

, t  R,

The projected trajectories are trajectories of control-affine systems on Sn-1 given by

m
s(t) = h(u(t), s(t)) = h0(s(t)) + ui(t)hi(s(t)),
i=1
h0(s) = As - sAs · s, hi(s) = Bis - sBis · s for i = 1, . . . , m.

(3.1)

The vector fields of the system on Sn-1 are obtained by subtracting the radial com-
ponent. The solutions will be denoted by s(t, s0, u), t  R. One also obtains an induced control system on projective space Pn-1 with vector fields Ph(u, ·) since
hi(s) = -hi(-s) for all i. Since bilinear control systems as well as their projections to Sn-1 and Pn-1 are
analytic, for these systems, local accessibility is equivalent to the corresponding ac-
cessibility rank condition (2.3); cf. Sontag [23, Theorem 12 on p. 179].
First we note the following simple result showing a first relation between control sets on Rn and control sets on Sn-1.
Proposition 3.1. Suppose that D  Rn is a control set of system (2.7). Then the projection P(D) to projective space Pn-1 is contained in a control set PD for the induced system on Pn-1, and the projection (D) to the unit sphere Sn-1 is contained in a control set SD for the induced system (3.1) on Sn-1. If D has nonvoid interior,
then also PD and SD have nonvoid interiors.
Proof. The assertions immediately follow from the definitions and the fact that
the projections  and P are open. Next we will analyze when a control set on the unit sphere Sn-1 generates a
control set on Rn. This result is based on a Diophantine approximation result used
for Lemma 3.4.
Theorem 3.2. Let SD be a control set with nonvoid interior for the system on the unit sphere Sn-1 and suppose that

5

(i) every point in int (SD) is locally acessible; (ii) there are +0 > 1, 0 > 0, and -  (0, 1) such that for all +  (+0 , +0 +0) there are points s+, s-  int (SD), controls u+, u-  U , and times +, - > 0 with

(+, s+, u+) = +s+, (-, s-, u-) = -s-.

(3.2)

Then the cone {s  Rn | > 0, s  SD } is a control set in Rn with nonvoid interior.
Remark 3.3. The proof of Theorem 3.2 will show that we can replace assumption
(ii) by the following assumption: (ii)' there are + > 1, 0  (0, 1), and -0  (0, 1 - 0) such that for all - 
(-0 , -0 + 0) there are points s+, s-  int (SD), controls u+, u-  U , and times +, - > 0 with (3.2).
Proof. First observe that (3.2) implies for the projected system on Sn-1

s(+, s+, u+) = s+, s(-, s-, u-) = s-.

Hence we get periodic solutions in int (SD)  Sn-1.. Step 1: Let s0  int (SD). Then for every x0  l := {s0  Rn | > 0 } the
closure of the reachable set from x0 contains the half-line l. For the proof of this claim, consider arbitrary points x0 = 0s0, x1 = 1s0  l
with 0, 1 > 0. The strategy is to steer the system from s0 to s+, then to go k times through the periodic trajectory for u+, then to steer the system to s-, go  times through the periodic trajectory for u-, and finally steer back the system to s0. The numbers k,   N will be adjusted such that the corresponding trajectories in Rn
starting in x0 approach x1. By local accessibility in int (SD) there are times 1, 2, 3 > 0 and controls v1, v2,
v3  U with

s(1, s0, v1) = s+, s(2, s+, v2) = s-, s(3, s-, v3) = s0. One finds for the system in Rn numbers 1, 2, 3 > 0 with
(1, x0, v1) = (1, 0s0, v1) = 1s+, (2, s+, v2) = 2s-, (3, s-, v3) = 3s0. Now define for k,   N a control function wk, by

wk,(t) = v1(t) for t  [0, 1], wk,(t) = u+(t - (1 + (i - 1)+)) for t  (1 + (i - 1)+, 1 + i+], i = 1, . . . , k, wk,(t) = v2(t - (1 + k+)) for t  (1 + k+, 1 + k+ + 2], wk,(t) = u-(t - (1 + k+ + 2 + (i - 1)-))
for t  (1 + k+ + 2 + (i - 1)-, 1 + k+ + 2 + i-], i = 1, . . . , , wk,(t) = v3(t - (1 + k+ + 2 + -)),
for t  (1 + k+ + 2 + -, 1 + k+ + 2 + - + 3].

The corresponding trajectory on Sn-1 is periodic and satisfies

s(1 + i+, s0, wk,) = s+ for i = 0, 1, . . . , k, s(1 + k+ + 2 + i-, s0, wk,) = s- for i = 0, 1, . . . , , s(1 + k+ + 2 + - + 3, s0, wk,) = s0,
6

and for the corresponding trajectory on Rn one finds using (2.8)

(1 + i+, x0, wk,) = + i 1s+ for i = 0, 1, . . . , k, (1 + k+ + 2 + i-, x0, wk,) = - i 2 + k 1s- for i = 0, 1, . . . , , (1 + k+ + 2 + - + 3, x0, wk,) = 3 -  2 + k 1s0.

Recall that our goal is to reach x1 = 1s0 approximately. We apply Lemma 3.4 with

a = +, b = (-)-1, and c = 1 (321)-1, where we choose +  (+0 , +0 + 0)

such

that

log b log a

=

- log - log +

is

irrational.

Thus

for

every

>0

there

are k,   N

with

+ k

-  - 1 (321)-1

=

(+)k (- )-

- 1 (321)-1

< ,

hence for all  > 0 there are k,   N with 321 + k -  - 1 < .

It follows that for some   (-, ) one can choose k,  such that

(1 + k+ + 2 + - + 3, x0, wk,) = 321 -  + k s0 = (1 + )s0.

Since  > 0 is arbitrary, it follows that x1 = 1s0 is in the closure of the reachable set of x0 and hence l is contained the closure of the reachable set from x0.
Step 2: Let x1, x2  {s  Rn | > 0, s  SD }, hence there are 1, 2 > 0 and s1, s2  SD with x1 = 1s1 and x2 = 2s2. Then there are a control u1 and a time t1  0 with s(t1, s1, u1) = s0, hence (t1, x1, u1) = 1s0  l for some 1 > 0. Since s0, s2  int(SD) one finds, for  > 0, a control u2 and a time t2  0 such that, for s3 := s(t2, s0, u2),

s3 - s2 < /2 and 2s3 - x2 = 2s3 - 2s2 < .

The trajectory in Rn satisfies (t2, s0, u2) = 2s3 for some 2 > 0. By (2.8) it follows that

(t2,

2 2

s0

,

u2

)

=

2 2

2s3

=

2s3.

Step

1

implies

that

one

finds

arbitrarily

close

to

2 2

s0



l

points

in

the

reachable

set from 1s0, hence in the reachable set from x1. By continuous dependence on the

initial value, it follows that under the control u2 points in the reachable set from x1

are steered into the -neighborhood of x2. Since  > 0 is arbitrary, this shows that

x2 is in the closure of the reachable set from x1. Step 3: We have shown that the cone D := {s  Rn | > 0, s  SD } is a set of

complete approximate controllability. It is maximal with this property, since any set

of approximate controllability in Rn projects to a set of approximate controllability

in Sn-1, and SD is a maximal set of approximate controllability. Finally, for every

point x  D there is a control u with (t, x, u)  D for all t  0, since this holds in

SD. Hence the cone D is a control set and it has a nonvoid interior.

Step 1 in the proof above is based on the following lemma which uses a Diophan-

tine approximation property.

Lemma

3.4.

Let a, b, c be real numbers with a, b > 1, c > 0, and

log b log a

 R \ Q.

Then for every  > 0 there are k,   N such that akb- - c < .

7

Proof. Since the logarithm is continuously invertible, it suffices to show that for every  > 0 there are k,   N with

 > log(akb-) - log c = |k log a -  log b - log c| ,

or, dividing by log a > 0,

We use the following Diophantine approximation result which is due to Tchebychef

[24, Th´eor`eme, p. 679]: For any irrational number  and any   R the inequality

x |y - x - | < 2 has an infinite number of solutions in x  N, y  Z. Observe

that here also y  N if  > 0, since then sgn(y) = sgn(x) = sgn(x) = 1. For an

application to the problem above, let  =

log b log a

Remark 3.5. The Diophantine approximation result used above is closely related

to a theorem due to Minkowski on inhomogeneous linear Diophantine approximation,

cf. Cassels, [8, Theorem I in Chapter III]. Here the existence of integers x, y solving

x |y - x - |

is

established,

but

not

the

existence

of

infinitely

pairs

with this property, as required for the proof above.

Remark 3.6. Suppose that for a control set SD on the unit sphere, every point in the interior is locally acessible and there are control values u±  int () such

that A(u+) has an eigenvalue + > 0 and A(u-) has an eigenvalue - < 0 with

eigenspaces satisfying E(±)  int (SD) = . Then assumption (ii) of Theorem 3.15 holds. In fact, all points s±  E(±)  int (SD) are equilibria for the induced system on Sn-1 with A(u±)s± = ±s±. This implies for all ± > 0 and the constant controls

u±   that

(+, s+, u+) = +0 s+ with +0 := e++ > 1, (-, s-, u-) = -s- with - := e-- < 1.

This follows, since the solutions of x = A(u±)x, x(0) = s±, are given by

(t, s±, u±) = eA(u±)ts± = e±ts±.

Varying +, we get that (+, s+, u+) = +s+ for all +  (+0 , +0 + 0) and some 0 > 0.
The following two examples illustrate Theorem 3.2. We consider problems in R2 where the induced system on the unit circle is not locally accessible. First let A
8

be given in Jordan normal form A =

1 0 0 2

and let the matrices B1 and B2

be diagonal. The situation is a bit more complicated than in Remark 3.6, since the

intersections of the relevant eigenspaces with the unit sphere yield boundary points

of the control set SD.

Example 3.7. Consider a system of the form

x y

=

1 0 0 2

+ u(t)

b11 0 0 b21

+ v(t)

b12 0 0 b22

x y

,

(3.3)

with 1, 2  R and control values (u(t), v(t))    R2. This can be written as

x y

=

1 + b11u + b12v

0

0

2 + b21u + b22v

x y

= A(u, v)

x y

.

For all (u, v)   the eigenvalues µ1(u, v) = 1 + b11u + b12v and µ2(u, v) = 2 + b21u + b22v of A(u, v) have the eigenspaces R × {0} and {0} × R, resp. Assume that there are control values (u1, v1), (u2, v2)   with

µ1(u1, v1) > 0, µ2(u1, v1) < 0 and µ1(u2, v2) < 0, µ2(u2, v2) > 0. (3.4)

For (u1, v1) the eigenspace R × {0} is attracting and for (u2, v2) the eigenspace {0} × R is attracting. One easily verifies that on the unit circle S1 there are four open
and invariant control sets SDi, i = 1, . . . , 4, with nonvoid interior on the unit sphere separated by the four points in the intersection of the eigenspaces R × {0} and {0} × R with S1. The four points in this intersection are invariant for all (u, v), hence they are not locally accessible, while every point in the control sets is locally accessible.
In order to verify condition (3.2), assume that there is (u3, v3)   with

µ1(u3, v3) = 0 and µ2(u3, v3) > 0.

Let

1

>

0,

and

define

2

:=

 µ1(u1,v1)-µ2(u1,v1)

1

µ2 (u3 ,v3 )

>

0

and

(3.5)

(u+(t), v+(t)) :=

(u1, v1) (u3, v3)

for for

t  [0, 1] t  (1, 2 + 1]

.

Fix a point s+  SDi. Then it follows that

(2 + 1, s+, u+, v+) = (2, (1, s+, u1, v1), u3, v3)

=

e0 e2 µ2 (u3 ,v3 )

e1 µ1 (u1 ,v1 ) e1 µ2 (u1 ,v1 )

s+ = e1µ1(u1,v1)s+.

Since 1 > 0 is arbitrary, the first equality in (3.2) holds with + = 2 + 1 and + = e1µ1(u1,v1) > 1.
Analogously, fix a point s-  SDi. Assume that there is (u4, v4)   with

µ1(u4, v4) = 0, µ2(u4, v4) < 0.

Define,

with

(u-(t), v-(t)) =

(u2, v2) (u4, v4)

for for

.

Then it follows that

(3 + 1, s-, u-, v-) = (3, (1, s-, u2, v2), u4, v4)

=

e0 e3 µ2 (u4 ,v4 )

e1 µ1 (u2 ,v2 ) e1 µ2 (u2 ,v2 )

s- = e1µ1(u2,v2)s-.

Thus also the second equality in (3.2) holds with - = 3 + 1 and - = e1µ1(u2,v2) < 1. Now Theorem 3.2 implies that there are four control set in R2 given by the interiors

of the four quadrants.

Observe that conditions (3.4), (3.5), and (3.6) are satisfied in the simple example

with A(u, v) =

u0 0v

and  = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]. Then µ1(u, v) = u, µ2(u, v) = v,

and one may choose

(u1, v1) = (1, -1), (u2, v2) = (-1, 1), (u3, v3) = (0, 1), (u4, v4) = (0, -1).

The next example shows that the situation is quite different if A is a two-
dimensional Jordan block; in particular, scalar controls suffice to verify assumption (3.2) in Theorem 3.2 for a control set SD = S1.
Example 3.8. Consider

x y

=

1 0

+ u(t)

b11 b12 0 b11

(3.7)

with   R and u(t)  . The system can be written as

x y

=

 + b11u 1 + b12u

 + b11u

x y

= A(u)

x y

.

For all u   the eigenvalue µ(u) =  + b11u has the eigenspace R × {0}. The intersection of the unit circle with the eigenspace is given by {(1, 0), (-1, 0)}, which

are fixed under any control for the projected system. Suppose that b12 = 0 and 

contains the two points u1 := 0 and u2 := -2/b12, and write µ1 = µ(u1) =  and

The solutions of (3.8) are given by

1(t, x0, y0) = eµ1t

,

resp. For the projected systems on the unit circle the trajectory on the upper half-
plane of the first equation tends for t   to (1, 0) and for t  - to (-1, 0). The
trajectory for the second equation moves in the opposite direction. This proves that the open upper semicircle on S1 is an invariant control set SD1. Analogously, also the open lower semicircle on S1 is an invariant control set SD2.
In order to verify the conditions in (3.2) fix a point s+  SD1. Let  > 0 and define

u+(t) =

u1 u2

for for

t  [0,  ] t  (, 2 ]

Similarly, we can find conditions for - < 1: The control sets on the unit sphere do

satisfying

(3.9).

Then there are two invariant control sets

with nonvoid interior in R2 given by the open upper and lower half-planes. Observe

that these conditions hold, e.g., for

 = 1, b11 = 1, b12 = 2, and u1 = 0, u2 = -1, u3 < -1.

Next we impose stronger assumptions on the homogeneous bilinear control system
(2.7). We require that the control range  is a compact and convex neighborhood of the origin and that the accessibility rank condition holds on all of Pn-1,

dim LA{Ph(u, ·); u  }(p) = n - 1 for all p  Pn-1.

(3.10)

Then by Colonius and Kliemann [9, Theorem 7.1.1] there are k0 control sets with nonvoid interior in Pn-1 denoted by PD1, . . . , PDk0, 1  k0  n. Exactly one of these control sets is an invariant control set.
Remark 3.9. Braga Barros and San Martin [6] use the classification of semisimple Lie groups acting transitively on projective space Pn-1 (cf. Boothby and Wilson
[5]) to determine the number k0  {1, . . . , n} of control sets PDi in projective space (it is either equal to n, n/2, or n/4).
Next we analyze the relations between the control sets for the induced systems on projective space Pn-1 and on the unit sphere Sn-1. We will frequently use the
following elementary facts that follow from (2.8): Let s1, s2  Sn-1. If s2 can be reached from s1 (for system (3.1)), then -s2 can
be reached from -s1. If on Pn-1 the point Ps2 can be reached from Ps1, then on Sn-1 at least one of the points s2 or -s2 can be reached from s1.
The proof of the following lemma is modeled after Bacciotti and Vivalda [2,
Lemma 3], where controllable systems are analyzed. Lemma 3.10. (i) Let SD be a control set on Sn-1. Then the projection of SD to
Pn-1 is contained in a control set PD. (ii) Assume that the accessibility rank condition (3.10) on Pn-1 holds and consider
a control set PDi on Pn-1. Suppose that there is s0  Sn-1 such that Ps0  int (PDi) and -s0 can be reached from s0. Then there exists a control set SD on Sn-1 containing A := {s  Sn-1 |Ps  PDi }.
Proof. Assertion (i) is immediate from the definitions. Concerning assertion (ii)
it is clear that for all s  A there is a control u such that the trajectory of system
(3.1) remains in A for all t  0. Now let s1, s2  A. We have to show that s2 is in the closure of the reachable set O+(s1) for system (3.1). Since Ps1, Ps2  PDi it follows
11

that s2  O+(s1) or -s2  O+(s1). In the first case we are done. In the second case it follows that s2  O+(-s1), and that, by our assumption, s0  O+(-s0). As noted in Section 2, P(-s1) = Ps1  PDi and Ps0  int (PDi) imply that Ps0 can be reached from P(-s1), hence s0  O+(-s1) or -s0  O+(-s1). We claim that also in the second case one can reach s0 from -s1. In fact, -s0  O+(-s1) implies s0  O+(-s0)  O+(-s1). Hence s0  O+(-s1) and we find -s0  O+(s1).
Since Ps0, Ps2  PD it follows that s2  O+(s0) or -s2  O+(s0). In the second case, s2  O+(-s0)  O+(s1) and in the first case, one has
s2  O+(s0)  O+(-s0)  O+(s1).

The proof of the next proposition uses arguments from Bacciotti and Vivalda [2,
Proposition 2].
Proposition 3.11. If accessibility rank condition (3.10) holds for the induced system on Pn-1, it also holds for the induced system on Sn-1.
Proof. Recall that Pn-1 = (Rn \ {0})/ , where  is the equivalence relation x  y if y = x with some  = 0. Furthermore, an atlas of Pn-1 is given by n charts
(Ui, i), where Ui is the set of equivalence classes [x1 : · · · : xn] with xi = 0 (the homogeneous coordinates) and i : Ui  Rn-1 is defined by

i([x1 : · · · : xn]) =

x1 xi

,

.

where the hat means that the i-th entry is missing. For the sake of simplicity we prove the rank condition for the North Pole of Sn-1
given by z¯0 = (0, . . . , 0, 1). By assumption, the rank of the Lie algebra of the system on Pn-1 is n - 1 on all of Pn-1. Consider the point x0 = [0 : · · · : 0 : 1]  Pn-1. Thus there exist n - 1 matrices A1, . . . , An-1 in the Lie algebra generated by the system on Rn \ {0} such that for the induced vector fields A1, . . . , An-1 in the Lie algebra for the system on Pn-1 one obtains that the rank of the family A1(x0), . . . , An-1(x0) is n - 1. Now [2, formula (5)] shows the following formula for the local expression of this family, which has the form An1 (z0), . . . , Ann-1(z0) with z0 = (0, . . . , 0); let ak1(z¯0), . . . , akn(z¯0) denote the n components of Akz¯0. Then, for k = 1, . . . , n - 1,
Ank (z0) = (ak1 (z¯0), . . . , akn-1(z¯0)) - akn(z¯0)z0 = (ak1 (z¯0), . . . , akn-1(z¯0)).
So Ank (z0) is the vector whose components are equal to the first n - 1 components of the last column of the matrix Ak.
On the other hand, the projections on Sn-1 of the linear vector fields for the matrices A1, . . . , An-1 are the vector fields (cf. (3.1))

Ak(x) = Akx - xAx · x, x  Sn-1.

Thus we get, for k = 1, . . . , n - 1

Ak(z¯0) = Akz¯0 - z¯0Akz¯0 · z¯0 = (ak1 (z¯0), . . . , akn-1(z¯0), akn(z0) - z¯0Akz¯0),

so the n - 1 first components of Ak(z¯0) are equal to the components of Ank (z0). This implies that the vectors A1(z¯0), . . . , An-1(z¯0) are linearly independent.
12

We get the following result characterizing the relation between the control sets
PD1, . . . , PDk0, 1  k0  n, on projective space and the control sets on the unit sphere.
Theorem 3.12. Suppose that accessibility rank condition (3.10) holds for the induced system on projective space Pn-1.
(i) If there is s0  Sn-1 with Ps0  int (PDi) such that -s0 can be reached for system (3.1) from s0, then SD := {s  Sn-1 |Ps  PD } is the unique control set on Sn-1 which projects to PDi.
(ii) For every control set PDi, i  {1, . . . , k0}, there are at most two control sets SD and SD on Sn-1 with nonvoid interior such that

{s  Sn-1 |Ps  PDi } = SD  SD,

(3.11)

and SD = - SD. (iii) There are k1 control sets with nonvoid interior on Sn-1 denoted by SD1, . . . ,
SDk1 with 1  k1  2k0  2n. At most two of the sets SDi are invariant control sets. Proof. (i) Suppose that there is Ps0  int (PDi) with -s0  O+(s0). By Lemma
3.10(ii) there is a control set SD on the unit sphere containing {s  Sn-1 |Ps  PDi }, hence the projection of SD to projective space contains PDi. Using Lemma 3.10(i) one concludes that SD = {s  Sn-1 |Ps  PDi }.
(ii) Fix a point s0  Sn-1 with Ps0  int (PDi) and define
A+ := s  Sn-1 Ps  PDi and s  O+(s0)  O-(s0) ,
A- := s  Sn-1 Ps  PDi and - s  O+(s0)  O-(s0) .

The set A+ is contained in a control set SD and the set A- is contained in a control set SD. Every point s with Ps  int (PDi) satisfies s  O+(s0) or -s  O+(s0) and it also satisfies s  O-(s0) or -s  O-(s0). If there is s  O+(s0) with -s  O-(s0) hence s  O-(-s0), it follows -s0  O+(s0). Then by part (i) the assertion follows. The same arguments apply if there is s with -s  O+(s0) and s  O-(s0). Hence we may assume that either s  O+(s0)  O-(s0) or -s  O+(s0)  O-(s0). This shows
that

{s  Sn-1 |Ps  int (PDi) }  A+  A-  (SD)  (SD) ,

It follows that {s  Sn-1 |Ps  PDi }  SD  SD, since P is an open map and PDi  int (PDi). By Lemma 3.10(i) the projections of SD and SD to Pn-1 are contained in
PDi, hence (3.11) follows. The same arguments with -s0 instead of s0 implies that SD = - SD. If SD or SD is an invariant control set, then also PDi is an invariant control set, hence there are at most two invariant control set on Sn-1.
(iii) This is a consequence of assertion (ii).
Recall the following definitions from Colonius and Kliemann [9]. For a solution
(t, x, u), t  0, of (2.7) the Lyapunov exponent is

(u,

x)

=

lim sup
t

1 t

log

(t, x, u)

.

(3.12)

Observe that the Lyapunov exponents are constant on lines through the origin. Definition 3.13. For a control set PD in Pn-1 the Floquet spectrum is given by

F l(PD) =

(u, x)

Px  int (PD) and u is piecewise constant  -periodic for some   0 with P(, x, u) = Px

,

13

and for a control set SD in Sn-1 the Floquet spectrum is given by

F l(SD) =

(u, x)

x  int (SD) and u is piecewise constant  -periodic for some   0 with s(, x, u) = x

.

In the  -periodic case considered here the Lyapunov exponents satisfy (u, x) =

1 

(, x, u)

for

x

= 1 and coincide with the Floquet exponents (cf. Teschl [25,

§3.6]). We note the following result.

Proposition 3.14. If SD is a control set with nonvoid interior on Sn-1 that

projects to a control set PD in Pn-1, then

F l(SD) = F l(PD).

Proof. The inclusion "F l(SD)  F l(PD)" is clear. For the converse, consider

Px  int (PD) and a piecewise constant  -periodic control u with P(, x, u) = Px.

We may suppose that x  Sn-1, hence x  SD or -x  SD. Consider the first case.

If

(, x, u)

with

it

follows

that

(u, x) =

F l(SD).

Otherwise

(, x, u) = -x with  > 0 and hence

(2, x, u) = (, (, x, u), u( + ·)) = - (-x) = 2x,

implying

(u, x)

F l(SD).

Analogously one argues in the case -x  SD. The following result describes the control sets in Rn under the accessibility rank
condition on projective space.
Theorem 3.15. Assume that the homogeneous bilinear control system (2.7) satisfies the accessibility rank condition (3.10) on Pn-1. If a control set SDi, i  {1, . . . , k1}, on Sn-1 satisfies 0  int (F l(SDi)), then the cone

Di = {x  Rn | > 0 and x  SDi }

generated by SDi is a control set with nonvoid interior in Rn \ {0}. At most two of the Di are invariant control sets.
Proof. By Proposition 3.11, every point in SDi is locally accessible. Hence the first assertion follows from Theorem 3.2, if we can show that assumption (ii) in that theorem holds. The Floquet spectrum over a control set in projective space is a
bounded interval, cf. [9, Proposition 6.2.14]. By Proposition 3.14 the same holds true
for the Floquet spectrum of F l(SDi). If 0  int (F l(SDi)), it follows that there are points s+, s-  int (SDi), controls u+, u-  U and times +, - > 0 such that

(+, s+, u+) = +s+, (-, s-, u-) = -s-,

where + := exp(+(u+, s+))  (1, ) and - := exp(-(u-, s-))  (0, 1). This verifies assumption (ii) of Theorem 3.2 if we take into account that we may vary + and hence +. Furthermore, every invariant control set D projects to an invariant control set on Sn-1, and here there are at most two invariant control sets.
Remark 3.16. Theorem 3.15 corrects Colonius and Kliemann [9, Corollary 12.2.6], where, assuming the stronger accessibility rank condition in Rn\{0}, a similar statement was given However, it was not taken into account that there may exist two
14

control sets on the unit sphere that project to the same control set on projective space. It remains an open question if there are control sets SDi with 0  int (F l(SDi)) that generate cones which are control sets on Rn \ {0}.
Remark 3.17. Suppose that under the assumptions of Theorem 3.15 an invariant control set Di in Rn \ {0} exists. Then Di  {0} is a closed cone in Rn generated by an invariant control set on the unit sphere. If the system is not controllable, this cone does not coincide with Rn, hence it is a nontrivial proper closed positively invariant cone in Rn. On the other hand, Do Rocio, San Martin, and Santana [10, Section 6] present an example in R4, which is not controllable and which also does not posses a nontrivial proper closed convex cone W in Rn which is positively invariant. Here the convexity of W is crucial: Such cones are pointed, i.e., W  (-W ) = {0}, cf. [10, Lemma 4.1]. For an invariant control set Di as in Theorem 3.15 the cone Di{0} need not be pointed (and hence not convex), since the invariant control set may contain the real eigenspace for a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues of A(u). Observe that here the convex closure of this cone, which is also positively invariant, coincides with Rn. An example is the three-dimensional linear oscillator in Colonius and Kliemann [9, Example 10.2.3]. The existence of nontrivial proper closed convex positively invariant cones in Rn is analyzed in [10, Theorem 4.2, Theorem 4.5].
The following example illustrates Theorem 3.15, cf. also [9, Examples 10.1.7 and 10.2.1] where for linear oscillators the spectral properties and the control sets in projective space are determined.
Example 3.18. Consider the damped linear oscillator

x¨ + 3x + (1 + u(t))x = 0 with u(t)   = [-, ],

where

x y

=

01 -1 -3

+u

=

. (3.13)

The eigenvalues of A(u) satisfy

det(I - A(u)) = det

 -1 1+u +3

= 2 + 3 + 1 + u = 0,

and one obtains two real eigenvalues

1(u)

=

and

2(u)

=

5 4

u

with corresponding eigenvectors (x, 1(u)x) and (x, 2(u)x), x = 0. Note that 2(u) < 0 if and only if u  [-, -1). Since for all u  [-, ] one has 1(u) < 2(u) the projected trajectories in P1 go from the eigenspace for 1(u) to the eigenspace for 2(u). A short computation shows that there is an open control set PD1 and a closed invariant control set PD2 in projective space P1 given by the projections of

x x

|x = 0,   F l(PD1)

,

15

x x

x = 0,   F l(PD2) ,

resp., where by [9, Theorem 10.1.1] the Floquet spectra are

.

The control sets in P1 induce four control sets on the unit circle S1. For PD2 one obtains the two control sets SD2 = - SD2. Since u = -1  (-, ) and 0 = 2(-1) 
int (F l(PD2)), Theorem 3.15 implies that there are two invariant control sets in R2 \ {0}, they are the cones

D2 =

Next we present a necessary and sufficient condition for controllability on Rn \{0}. The infimal and supremal Lyapunov exponents, cf. (3.12), are

 = inf inf (u, x) and  = sup sup (u, x),

uU x=0

uU x=0

resp. The following result improves Colonius and Kliemann [9, Corollary 12.2.6(iii)], where the accessibility rank condition is assumed in Rn \ {0}.
Corollary 3.19. Assume that the homogeneous bilinear control system (2.7) satisfies the accessibility rank condition (3.10) on Pn-1. Then it is controllable in Rn \ {0} if and only if the induced system on Pn-1 is controllable and  < 0 < .
Proof. Controllability on Rn \ {0} implies controllability on Pn-1. Furthermore, asymptotic null controllability to 0  Rn, and hence exponential null controllability follows by [9, Corollary 12.2.3]. Thus  < 0 and, by time reversal, also  > 0 follows.
Conversely, controllability on Pn-1 implies by Bacciotti and Vivalda [2, Theorem 1] that SD = Sn-1 is a control set. By Theorem 3.15, it follows that Rn\{0} is a control set. This implies that for every initial point x = 0 the reachable set O+(x) is dense in Rn \ {0}, i.e., approximate controllability holds. For homogeneous bilinear control
systems, Cannarsa and Sigalotti [7, Theorem 1] shows that approximate controllability implies controllability in Rn \ {0}. This completes the proof.
Remark 3.20. The condition  < 0 <  can be replaced by the requirement that 0  int F l(Pn-1) . This follows, since by [9, Theorem 7.1.5(iv)] the Floquet
spectrum satisfies F l(Pn-1) = [, ] if Pn-1 is a control set. Remark 3.21. For control systems on semisimple Lie groups, San Martin [22,
Proposition 5.6] shows the following result. Let G  Sl(n, R) be a semisimple, connected, and noncompact group acting transitively on Rn \ {0} and let S be a semigroup with nonvoid interior in G. Then S is controllable on Rn \ {0} if and only if S is controllable in Pn-1.
4. Equilibria of affine systems. In the rest of this paper we discuss control
sets for affine systems of the form (1.1). We begin by analyzing the equilibria.
For each control value u  , an associated equilibrium point of system (1.1) is a
state xu that satisfies

0 = A(u)xu + Cu + d.
16

(4.1)

If for u   there is a solution xu of (4.1) and det A(u) = 0, then every point in the nontrivial affine subspace xu + ker A(u) is an equilibrium. If there is u   with Cu + d = 0, then equation (4.1) always has the solution xu = 0. If det A(u) = 0, then there exists a unique equilibrium of (1.1) given by

xu = -A(u)-1[Cu + d].

(4.2)

The following simple but useful result shows that for constant control u the phase portrait of the inhomogeneous equation is obtained by shifting the origin to xu.
Proposition 4.1. Consider for constant control u   a solution (t, x, u), t  0, of the inhomogeneous equation (1.1) and let xu be an associated equilibrium. Then (t, x, u) - xu is a solution of the homogeneous equation x (t) = A(u)x(t) with initial value x - xu.
Proof. We compute

d dt

[(t,

x,

u)

-

xu]

=

A(u)

[(t,

x,

u)

-

xu]

+

A(u)xu

+

Cu

+d

=

A(u)

[(t,

x,

u)

-

xu]

.

The following proposition shows that the affine control system (1.1) is equivalent to an inhomogeneous bilinear system, if there is u0   with Cu0 + d = 0.
Proposition 4.2. Suppose that there is u0   with Cu0 + d = 0 and consider

m
x (t) = A(u0)x(t) + vi(t)Bix(t) + Cv(t) with v(t)   :=  - u0,
i=1

(4.3)

with trajectories denoted by (·, x, v). Then the trajectories (·, x, u), u  U, of (1.1) satisfy (t, x, u) = (t, x, v), t  R, with controls v(t) = u(t) - u0, t  R.
Proof. One computes for a solution x(t) = (t, x, u), t  R, of (1.1)

m

x (t) = Ax(t) + u0i Bix(t) +

ui(t) - u0i Bix(t) + C(u(t) - u0) + Cu0 + d

i=1

i=1

m

= A(u0)x(t) + vi(t)Bix(t) + Cv(t).

i=1

We introduce the following notation for the set of equilibria,
E = {x  Rn |0 = A(u)x + Cu + d for some u   }, E0 = {x  Rn |0 = A(u)x + Cu + d for some u  int () }.
Note that E0 = E if  = int (). For the following discussion of systems with scalar controls cf. Mohler [19, Section 2.4].
Theorem 4.3. Consider system (1.1) with scalar control and assume that for all u   it follows from det(A + uB) = 0 that there is no solution to equation (4.1).
(i) Suppose that there is u0   = R with A + u0B nonsingular. Then there are at most 1  r  n control values vi  R such that the equilibrium set is given by
E = {xu u  R \ {v1, . . . , vr} }
and is the union of at most n+1 smooth curves. These curves have no finite endpoints except possibly the point 0  Rn, where these curves also may intersect.

(ii) If  is a possibly unbounded interval, the equilibrium set E has at most n + 1
connected components. Proof. First note that xu = -(A + uB)-1[Cu + d] describes a smooth curve as
long as det(A + uB) = 0. Since det(A + uB) is a nontrivial polynomial in u of degree at most n, there are most n real roots v1, . . . , vr, 0  r  n, of det(A + uB) = 0. By our assumption the vectors Cvi + d are not in the range of A + viB.
Let y1, . . . , yn be a basis of Rn. Then every equilibrium xu,

(A + uB)xu = -[Cu + d],

(4.4)

has a unique representation

xu = 1(u)y1 + · · · + n(u)yn.
Now consider a sequence uk  vi for some i. If xuk remains bounded, we may assume that it converges to some y  Rn and hence every j (uk) converges to some j  R. Multiplying (4.4) with u = uk by j(uk) we find that
j(uk)(A + ukB)xuk = -j(uk)[Cuk + d]
and hence for k  

j (A + viB)y = -j(Cvi + d).
If j = 0 for some j, it follows that y is an equilibrium for vi contradicting the assumption of the theorem. It follows that either xuk  0 for k   or xuk becomes unbounded for k  .
(ii) If  = [u, u], u < u, the equilibrium set E = {xu u   \ {v1, . . . , vr} } consists of at most n + 1 smooth curves having no finite endpoints except possibly 0, with the possible exception of the equilibria corresponding to the minimum and maximum values of u in , i.e., u = u, u. If there is more than one curve constituting E, then the finite end points which are the equilibria xu and xu must lie on different curves. Hence the assertion also follows in this case. Similarly, the assertion follows for intervals which are unbounded to one side.
The following example is used in Rink and Mohler [20, Example 2] and Mohler [19, Example 2 on page 32] as an example for a system that is not controllable. It illustrates the result above.

5. Control sets and equilibria of affine systems. The controllability properties near equilibria will be analyzed assuming that the linearized control systems are controllable. This yields results on the control sets around equilibria.
In order to describe the properties of the system linearized about an equilibrium, we recall the following classical result from Lee and Markus [18, Theorem 1 on p. 366].
Theorem 5.1. Consider the control process in Rn

x = f (x, u),

(5.1)

where f is C1 and suppose that f (0, 0) = 0 where 0 is in the interior of the control

range .

Then the controllable set O-(0) is open if, with A =

0)

and

B

(0,

rank[B, AB, . . . , An-1B] = n.

Sontag

[23,

Theorem 3, p. 89].

19

We apply this result to affine control systems and obtain that the reachable set and the controllable set for an equilibrium are open, if the linearized system is controllable.
Proposition 5.2. Consider the affine system (1.1) and let xu be an equilibrium for a control value u  int (), where the rank condition

rank[B(u), A(u)B(u), . . . , (A(u))n-1 B(u)] = n

(5.3)

holds with B(u) defined by

B(u) = C + [B1, . . . , Bm] xu.

(5.4)

Then the reachable set O+(xu) and the controllable set O-(xu) are open. If A(u) =

A+

m i=1

uiBi

is

invertible,

then

B(u) = C - B1A(u)-1(Cu + d), . . . , BmA(u)-1(Cu + d) .

Proof. First we convince ourselves that Theorem 5.1 can be applied to arbitrary equilibria (x0, u0) with u0  int () instead of (0, 0). In fact, define f~(x, u) := f (x + x0, u + u0). Then (0, 0) is an equilibrium of

x (t) = f~(x(t), u(t)) with control range  - u0,

(5.5)

and the control value u = 0 is in int( - u0). The solutions (t, 0, u), t  0, of (5.5) are given by (t, x0, u + u0) - x0, since (0, x0, u + u0) - x0 = 0 and

d dt

(t, x0, u + u0) - x0

= f ((t, x0, u+u0), u(t)+u0) = f~((t, x0, u+u0)-x0, u(t)).

Hence O-(x0) coincides with the controllable set O~-(0) of (5.5). The rank condition (5.2) for (5.5) involves

By (5.3) the rank condition (5.2) is satisfied. Applying Theorem 5.1 we conclude that the controllable set O-(xu) is open. By time reversal, cf. Lemma 2.2, also the reachable set O+(xu) is open.
If A(u) is invertible, the formula for B(u) follows from (4.2).
The following proposition shows that the controllability rank condition (5.3) holds generically for controls u  Rm if it holds in some u0.
Proposition 5.3. Assume that A(u) is invertible for all u  Rm and that the rank condition (5.3) holds for some u0  Rm. Then (5.3) holds for all u in an open and dense subset of Rm.
Proof. Define

B(u) := det A(u)C - [B1Adj(A(u))C, . . . , BmAdj(A(u))C] ,
20

where Adj(A(u)) is defined by (A(u))-1 det A(u) = Adj(A(u)). Condition (5.3) holds if and only if

rank[B(u), A(u)B(u), . . . , (A(u))n-1 B(u)] = n.

(5.6)

The entries of the matrix in (5.6) are polynomial in the variables u1, . . . , um. Using the assumption, one finds that the set of u  Rm violating (5.6) is contained in a proper algebraic variety; the complement of such a set is open and dense in Rm (this
follows in the same way as the genericity of the controllability rank condition (5.2),
cf. Sontag [23, Proposition 3.3.12]).
Remark 5.4. For a system of the form (1.1) with scalar control the assumptions
of Proposition 5.3 imply that there are at most finitely many u such that the rank
condition (5.3) is violated. This follows taking into account that for scalar u the
entries of the matrix in (5.6) are polynomial in the scalar variable u, hence there are
at most finitely many zeros.
A consequence of Proposition 5.2 is the following first result on control sets.
Proposition 5.5. Consider the affine system (1.1) and assume that the rank condition (5.3) is satisfied for some u  int(). Then the set D = O-(xu)  O+(xu) is a control set of system (1.1) containing the equilibrium xu in the interior.
Proof. By Proposition 5.2 the sets O-(xu) and O+(xu) are open neighborhoods of xu, hence it follows that xu is in the interior of the set D0 := O-(xu)  O+(xu).
Let x  D0. Then xu  O+(x) and therefore O+(xu)  O+(x) and as D0  O+(xu), it follows that D0  O+(x). Next we show that there is a control v  U with (t, x, v)  D0 for all t  0. Since x  O-(xu) there are T > 0 and v1  U such that (T, x, v1) = xu and (t, x, v1)  O-(xu) for all t  [0, T ]. Furthermore, (t, x, v1)  O+(x) and x  O+(xu), and hence continuous dependence on the initial value shows that (t, x, v1)  O+(xu) for all t  [0, T ]. Now the control function

v(t) :=

v1(t) for t  [0, T ] u for t > T

yields (t, x, v)  D0 for all t  0. We have shown that D0 satisfies properties (i) and (ii) in Definition 2.1. Hence it is contained in a maximal set D with these properties,
i.e., a control set, obtained as the union of all sets satisfying properties (i) and (ii)
and containing D0.
Let us show that D0 = D. By the definition of control sets and xu  D, the inclusion D  O+(xu) holds and for x  D one has xu  O+(x). Using that O-(xu) is a neighborhood of xu this implies that there are T > 0 and a control u  U with (T, x, u)  O-(xu), and hence x  O-(xu). This shows that D  O-(xu)  O+(xu) = D0 and hence equality holds concluding the proof that D0 is a control set.

Next we show that every connected subset of the set E0 of equilibria is contained in a single control set, if the systems linearized about the equilibria are controllable.
Theorem 5.6. Let C  {xu |u  int () } = E0 be a connected subset of the set of equilibria of system (1.1) and assume that for every equilibrium xu in C the control u satisfies the rank condition (5.3). Then there exists a control set D containing C in the interior and D = O-(xu)  O+(xu) for every xu  C.
Proof. By Proposition 5.5 every equilibrium xu  C is contained in the interior of a control set. Consider two points xu and xv in C. Then xv  O+(xu). In fact, consider a continuous path from xu to xv in C, say h : [0, 1]  C with h(0) = xu and
21

h(1) = xv. Let

 := sup{s  [0, 1] s  [0, s] : h(s)  O+(xu) }.

Observe that  > 0, since by Proposition 5.2, the reachable set O+(xu) is open. If  < 1, then y := h( )  O+(xu) \ O+(xu)  O+(xu). Thus O-(y)  O+(xu) = . On the other hand, y is an equilibrium corresponding to a control in the interior of . Again Proposition 5.2 implies that O-(y) is a neighborhood of y, and hence O-(y)  O+(xu) = . This contradiction shows that  = 1 and y = xv. Thus one can steer the system from any point xu  C to any other point xv  C. It follows that C is contained in a single control set D. The same arguments show that, in fact, C is
contained in the interior of D.
Remark 5.7. For scalar control, Theorem 4.3 shows that there are at most n + 1
connected components of the set E of equilibria, which consists of at most n+1 smooth
curves. Thus also E0 consists of at most n + 1 smooth curves which are the connected components. Hence, under the assumptions of Theorem 5.6, there are at most n + 1
control sets containing an equilibrium in the interior.
In the rest of this section, we relate the controllability properties of system (1.1)
to spectral properties of the matrices A(u), u  .
Lemma 5.8. Consider the affine system (1.1) and suppose that xu is an equilibrium for a control value u  int() satisfying the rank condition (5.3).
(i) If every eigenvalue of A(u) has negative real part, it follows that O-(xu) = Rn. (ii) If every eigenvalue of A(u) has positive real part, it follows that O+(xu) = Rn. Proof. By Proposition 5.2 the rank condition (5.3) implies that O-(xu) and O+(xu) are open. (i) Let 0 <  < - max{Re  | an eigenvalue of A(u) }. Then there is a constant
c0  1 such that every solution (·, x, u) of the autonomous linear differential equation x (t) = A(u)x(t) satisfies

(t, x, u)  c0e-t x for all t  0.

(5.7)

The variation-of-constants formula applied for x  Rn and xu shows that

(t, x, u) - xu
t
= eA(u)tx + eA(u)(t-s)[Cu + d]ds - eA(u)txu -
0
= eA(u)t (x - xu) .

t
eA(u)(t-s)[Cu + d]ds
0

Thus (5.7) implies

(t, x, u) - xu  c0e-t x - xu  0 for t  .

Since O-(xu) is a neighborhood of xu, there exists T > 0 such that (T, x, u)  O-(xu). Thus x  O- ((T, x, u))  O-(xu) and Rn = O-(xu) follows.
(ii) For the system x (t) = -A(u)x - Cu - d, every eigenvalue of -A(u) has negative real part. By (i) and time reversal, Lemma 2.2, the assertion follows.
Remark 5.9. An easy consequence of this lemma is that the system is controllable if there are u, v   with equilibria xu, xv in the same connected component of the set E0 such that every eigenvalue of A(u) has negative real part and every eigenvalue of
22

A(v) has positive real part; cf. Mohler [19, Main Result, p. 28] for the special case of inhomogeneous bilinear systems of the form (2.6).
The following corollary to Theorem 5.6 shows that there is a control set around the set of equilibria for uniformly hyperbolic matrices A(u), u  .
Corollary 5.10. Consider an affine control system of the form (1.1) and assume that
(i) the control range  = int() is compact and int () is connected; (ii) the matrices A(u) are uniformly hyperbolic in the following sense: There is k with 0  k  n such that for all u   there are k eigenvalues with Re 1(u), . . . , Re k(u) < 0 and n - k eigenvalues with Re k+1(u), . . . , Re n(u) > 0; (iii) every u  int () satisfies the rank condition (5.3). Then the set E = E0 of equilibria is compact and connected and E0 is connected and there exists a control set D with E0  int(D). Proof. First observe that all matrices A(u), u  , are invertible, since 0 is not an eigenvalue. Thus the set E = {xu |u   } of equilibria is compact and E0 is connected, since xu depends continuously on u. By Theorem 5.6 there exists a control set containing E0 in the interior. Since int () is connected, also  = int() is connected, cf. Engelking [13, Corollary 6.1.11], and hence also the set E = E0. If condition (ii) of Corollary 5.10 holds with k = 0 or k = n, i.e., if all matrices A(u) are stable or all are totally unstable, the rank condition (iii) for the linearized systems can be weakened. Corollary 5.11. Let assumption (i) of Corollary 5.10 be satisfied and assume that there are at most finitely many points in int () such that the rank condition (5.3) is violated. (i) If for all u  int () all eigenvalues of A(u) have negative real parts, there exists a closed control set D with E0  int(D). (ii) If for all u  int () all eigenvalues of A(u) have positive real parts, there exists a control set D with E0  int(D). Proof. As in Corollary 5.10(i) it follows that the set E0 of equilibria is connected. Consider equilibria xu, xv  E0 with u, v  int () and suppose that xu satisfies condition (5.3). Hence there is a control set Du containing xu in the interior. We use a construction similar to the one in the proof of Theorem 5.6: There is a continuous map h : [0, 1]  E0 with h(0) = xu and h(1) = xv. Let
 := sup{s  [0, 1] |s  [0, s] : h(s)  Du }.
Observe that  > 0, since xu  int (Du). If  < 1, then y := h( )  Du and y = xw is an equilibrium for some w  int (). If w satisfies (5.3), then by Proposition 5.5 xw is in the interior of a control set contradicting the choice of  . It remains to discuss the case where w violates (5.3).
(i) Since all eigenvalues of A(u) have negative real parts, Lemma 5.8(i) implies that xw  O-(xu) = Rn. Hence one can steer xw (in finite time) into the interior of Du, and by continuous dependence on the initial value, this holds for all x in a neighborhood N (xw). Note that xw  Du  Du. Since there are only finitely many points violating (5.3), all points h(s) with s  (,  + ) for some  > 0 satisfy (5.3) and hence they are in a single control set D and hence xw  D. Then all points in the nonvoid intersection N (xw)  D can be steered into Du. The same arguments show that one can steer points in Du into D, hence D = Du. This contradicts the choice of  . It follows that  = 1 and xv  Du. Using xv  O-(xu) = Rn and
23

Du = O+(xu)  O-(xu) = O+(xu) one sees that xv  Du. We conclude that all
equilibria in E0 are contained in the interior of a single closed control set. (ii) Since all eigenvalues of A(u) have positive real parts, Lemma 5.8(ii) implies
that xw  O+(xu) = Rn. This shows that xw can be reached from xu  int (Du).
Continuous dependence on the initial value shows that all points in a neighborhood
N (xw) of xw can be reached from the interior of Du. Since there are only finitely many points violating (5.3), all points h(s) with s  (,  + ) for some  > 0 are in a single control set D and xw  D. Then all points in the nonvoid intersection N (xw)  D can be reached from the interior of Du. The same arguments show that some point in int (Du) can be reached from D, hence D = Du. This contradicts the choice of  . It follows that  = 1 and xv  Du. Using xv  O+(xu) = Rn and Du = O+(xu)  O-(xu) = O-(xu) one sees that xv  Du. We conclude that all
equilibria in E0 are contained in the interior of a single control set. Remark 5.12. Remark 5.4 shows for an affine system of the form (1.1) with
scalar control satisfying the assumptions of Proposition 5.3,that there are at most
finitely many points u where the rank condition (5.3) is violated.
Next we provide a sufficient condition for the existence of unbounded control sets.
Theorem 5.13. Consider an affine control system of the form (1.1), let C be a
connected subset of the set E0 of equilibria of system (1.1) and define (C) = {u  int() |xu  C }. Assume that
(i) there is u0  (C) such that A(u0) has the eigenvalue 0 = 0 and Cu0 + d is not in the range of A(u0);
(ii) every u  (C), u = u0, satisfies rankA(u) = n and the rank condition (5.3). Then, there is an unbounded control set D  Rn containing C in the interior. More precisely, for uk  (C) with uk  u0 for k  , the equilibria xuk  C  int(D) satisfy for k  

xuk

  and

xuk xuk

 ker A(u0)  Sn-1.

(5.8)

Proof. By Theorem 5.6 there is a control set D containing C in the interior. In
order to show that D is unbounded, we argue similarly as in the scalar situation in Theorem 4.3. Consider a basis y1, . . . , yn of Rn. Every equilibrium xu  C satisfying A(u)xu = - [Cu + d], has the representation

xu = 1(u)y1 + · · · + n(u)yn,

(5.9)

where the coefficients j (u) depend continuously on u. Let uk  (C) converge to u0 and assume, by way of contradiction, that xuk remains bounded, hence we may suppose that there is x0  Rn with xuk  x0. Then for all j  {1, . . . , n} the coefficients j(uk) remain bounded, and we may assume that there are j  R with j(uk)  j . This implies

j (uk)A(uk)xuk  j A(u0)x0 = -j Cu0 + d .

By assumption (i) it follows that j = 0 for every j  {1, . . . , n} and hence xuk  x0 = 0. Then

0 = A(u0)x0 = -[Cu0 + d],

again contradicting assumption (i). We have shown that xuk becomes unbounded for k  . Since Cuk + d  Cu0 + d, we get

A(uk )

xuk xuk

=

1 xuk

24

Cuk + d  0.

On the other hand, every cluster point y  Rn of the bounded sequence xuk satisfies
xuk
y = 1 and A(uk)  A(u0), and (5.8) follows.
Theorem 5.13 sheds some light on the relation between controllability properties of affine systems and their homogeneous bilinear parts: By Theorem 3.15 assumption (i) is related to the existence of a control set of the latter system in Rn.
We state the following result concerning closed invariant cones (cf. Remark 3.17). This is formulated in the context of semigroup actions. Denote by Saff and Sbi the system semigroups of the affine and bilinear control systems given by (1.1) and (2.7). They correspond to piecewise constant controls (see Appendix A of [9]). The system group of the affine control system is given by the semidirect product G = H  Rn, where H is the system group of the homogenous bilinear system. The affine group operation is defined by (g, v) · (h, w) = (gh, v + gw) for all (g, v), (h, w)  G, and the affine action of G on Rn is given by (g, v) · w = gw + v with (g, v)  G and w  Rn using the linear action of H on Rn. A set Q  Rn is invariant under Saff and Sbi if and only if it is invariant for the affine control system and the homogeneous bilinear control systems, respectively. We get the following relations between invariance of a closed cone for Saff and Sbi.
Proposition 5.14. Consider an affine control system of the form (1.1) and its homogeneous bilinear part (2.7), and let K be a closed cone in Rn.
(i) Suppose that K is invariant for the homogeneous bilinear part and Cu + d  K for all u  . Then K is invariant for the affine control system.
(ii) If K is invariant for the affine control system, then it is invariant for the homogeneous bilinear part.
Proof. Assertion (i) is immediate from the definitions. The assumption in (ii) means that (g, v) · w  K for all (g, v)  Saff and w  K. Suppose, by way of contradiction, that there exists g  Sbi with x := gw / K for some w  K; hence g(w) = (gw) = x  K for all  > 0. It follows that

inf{ x - w |w  K } =  inf{ x - w |w  K }   for   .

Hence for every v  Rn there is  > 0 such that inf{ g(w) + v - w |w  K } > 0

implying g(w) + v  K. This means for the action of Saff that (g, v) · (w) = g(w) + v  K contradicting the invariance of K for Saff .

Remark 5.15. Jurdjevic and Sallet [16, Theorem 2] shows that controllability

of an affine control system without fixed points can be guaranteed if its homogeneous bilinear part is controllable. Furthermore, for Q  Rn let A(Q) be its affine hull.

Suppose that Q is invariant for the affine control system. Then [16, Lemma 3] implies

that A(Q) is invariant for the

Q, i  R with

p i=1

i

=

0, p



affine control system N} is invariant for its

and the set {

p i=1

homogeneous bilinear part.



Finally, we illustrate Theorem 5.6 and Theorem 5.13 by discussing the control

sets for two affine systems. Recall that by Theorem 3.15, the existence of a control u0  int() such that 0 is an eigenvalue of A(u0) is connected with the existence of

an unbounded control set of the bilinear system x = A(u)x.

Example 5.16. Consider again Example 4.4. In order to describe the control

sets

and there are control sets Di with Ci  int (Di) for i = 1, 2, 3. Since these sets of equilibria are unbounded also the control sets are unbounded. Based on Proposition 4.1, a lengthy argument involving the phase portraits for constant controls shows that one cannot steer the system from D2 to D3 or D1 and from D1 to D3, hence these control sets are pairwise different.
Next we take up the linear oscillator from Example 3.18 and consider an associated affine control system. We will show that there are two unbounded control sets.
Example 5.17. Consider the affine control system given by

x¨ + 3x + (1 + u(t))x = u(t) + d with u(t)  [-, ],

where  

1,

and d  R. Hence the system equation has the form

x y

=

01 -1 -3

x y

+ u(t)

00 -1 0

x y

+ u(t)

0 1

+

0 d

.

For the equilibria with u = -1 we find

This yields that the connected components of the set E0 of equilibria are

(5.10)

C1 =

1+u

u  (-, -1) , C2 =

u  (-1, ) .

For d = 1 there is a single equilibrium given by (xu, yu) = (1, 0) for every u = -1. Henceforth we assume d = 1.
26

Let d < 1. Then for u  [-, -1) one has d + u < 1 + u < 0, and for u  (-1, ] one has 1 + u > 0, hence

C1 =

x 0

d 1

Let d > 1. Then for u  [-, -1) one has d - 1 > 0 and 1 + u < 0 and for u  (-1, ] one has 1 + u > 0, hence

C1 =

x 0

x

d 1

Note that for all d one has C1  C2 = . The equilibria in C1 are stable nodes.

For every compact subset of C2, the equilibria are uniformly hyperbolic, since here 1(u) < 0 < 2(u) with 2(u)  0 for u  -1.
Next we check the assumptions of Theorem 5.13. Note that for u0 = -1 the

matrix A(-1) =

01 0 -3

has the eigenvalue 0 = 0 with eigenspace R × {0}, and

Im A(-1) = {(y, -3y) |y  R }. Furthermore

Cu0 + d =

0 1

(-1) +

0 d

=

0 d-1

is not in the range of A(-1). This verifies assumption (i) in Theorem 5.13. In order to check the rank condition (5.3) we compute for u = -1

B(u) = C + B

xu yu

0 1

00 -1 0

d+u 1+u

-1 - u -3

0
1-d 1+u

=

1-d

1+u

-3

1-d 1+u

.

Hence rank [B(u), A(u)B(u)] = 2 for u = -1. Theorem 5.13 implies that there are
unbounded control sets Di containing the equilibria in Ci, i = 1, 2, in the interior. For uk  u0 = -1, the equilibria (xuk , yuk ) = (xuk , 0) become unbounded for k   and satisfy

(xuk , 0) (xuk , 0)

 ker A(-1)  S1 =

1 0

,

-1 0

for all k.

In the simple case considered here, the latter assertion is already clear by formula
(5.10) for the equilibria.
We claim that the control sets around the equilibria satisfy D1 = D2. Suppose first d > 1. We show that one cannot steer the system from D1 to D2. Recall that by Proposition 4.1 for constant u the phase portrait of the affine equation is obtained from the phase portrait of the homogeneous equation by shifting the origin to the
corresponding equilibrium. The equilibria in C2 are saddles and the unstable manifold of every equilibrium in C2 coincides with the affine subspace given by the equilibrium plus the unstable subspace of the homogeneous equation given by {(x, x) |x  R }
with  = 2(u) > 0. We obtain that for every constant control u  (-1, ) the trajectories starting left of the line

l := (xu, 0) + (x, 2(u)x) |x  R ,
27

stay to the left of this line. For constant control u  (-, -1) the corresponding equilibrium in C1 is a stable node with 1(u) < 2(u) < 0. Hence the trajectories of the affine system starting left of the line l remain to the left of this line. Thus no trajectory corresponding to a piecewise constant control (and hence for arbitrary controls) can go from D1 to D2.
For d < 1 one argues similarly.
