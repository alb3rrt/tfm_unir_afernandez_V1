## Abstract

We experimentally demonstrate an imaging technique based on quantum noise modifications after interaction with an opaque object. This approach is particularly attractive for applications requiring weak illumination. We implement a homodyne-like detection scheme which allows us to eliminate detrimental effects of the camera's dark noise. Here we illuminate the object with squeezed vacuum containing less than one photon per frame, generated in an atomic ensemble, and reconstruct the shape of the object with higher contrast than the direct intensity imaging using 1000 times more photons.
