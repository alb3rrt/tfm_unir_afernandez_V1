Abstract. Recently, Gross, Mansour and Tucker introduced the partial-twuality polynomials. In this paper, we find that when there are enough parallel edges, any multiple graph is a negative answer to the problem 8.7 in their paper [European J. Combin. 95 (2021), 103329]: Is the restricted-orientable partial-Petrial polynomial of an arbitrary ribbon graph even-interpolating? In addition, we also find a counterexample to the conjecture 8.1 of Gross, Mansour and Tucker: If the partial-dual genus polynomial is neither an odd nor an even polynomial, then it is interpolating.

1. Introduction

We assume that the readers are familiar with the basic knowledge of topo-

logical graph theory. The reader is referred to [GMT21a] for the explanation of

all terms not defined here.

Let G|A ( G|A ) be the partial dual (partial Petrial) of G with respect to A  E(G). Denote by v(G), e(G), f (G) and c(G) the number of vertices, edges, faces and connected components of G, respectively. For ·  {, , , , }, Gross, Mansour, Tucker [GMT21a] introduced the partial-· polynomial for the ribbon

graph G, i.e.,

 E·G(z) =

zeu[G·|A ].

AE(G)

They also introduced the restricted orientable partial- polynomial of G by enumerating Euler-genus only over edge-subsets A  E(G) such that G|A is orientable. We recall that partial duality was invented by Chmutov in [Chm09]. In [EM12], Ellis-Monaghan and Moffatt extended the partial-duality to include the Wilson dual, the Petrie dual, and the two kinds of triality operators. In [AE19], Abrams and Ellis-Monaghan called the five operators twualities. We

The support of a polynomial f =  aizi is the set {i|ai = 0}. If supp( f ) is an
i=0
integer interval [m, n] of all integers from m to n, inclusive, we call f an interpolating polynomial. The size of integer interval [m, n] is the number of elements of [m, n]. If supp( f ) is the set of all even natural numbers in an integer interval, then f is even-interpolating. A polynomial such that the only terms that have non-zero coefficients are the terms of even (odd) degree is said to be an even (odd) polynomial.
Conjecture 8.1 and Problem 8.7 in their paper [GMT21a] state that
Conjecture 1.1. If the partial- polynomial EG(z) is neither an odd nor an even polynomial, then it is interpolating.
Problem 1.2. Is the restricted-orientable partial- polynomial of an arbitrary ribbon graph G even-interpolating?

In this paper, we first disprove Conjecture 1.1 by finding an infinite family of ribbon graphs as counterexamples. Then we answer the problem 1.2 by proving the restricted orientable partial polynomial of any multiple ribbon graph with enough parallel edges ( we also have a tight lower bound for this) are not eveninterpolating.
Remark Throughout the paper, we will use the rotation projection [GT87] of G instead of the ribbon graph G itself (See Figure 2.1 - Figure 2.6).

2. Main result

In this section, we first derive a recursion for the partial- polynomials, and then we use it to construct an infinite family of ribbon graphs as a counterexample to the Conjecture 1.1.

2.1. Counterexamples to the Conjecture 1.1. Given two disjoint ribbon graphs
G1 and G2, we let G1  G2 denote the join of G1 and G2. A subdivision of G is obtained by replacing edge e = uv by a path uwv, and a proper edge is two
ends of an edge are distinct. The contraction on edge e is denoted by G/e, and
we denote by G - e the graph obtained from G by deleting the ribbon e. The complement of A in E(G) is Ac = E(G) - A.

Theorem 2.1. [Mof12] Let G be a ribbon graph and A  E(G), then

(2.1)

eu(G|A ) = 2c(G) + e(G) - f (A) - f (Ac).

Theorem 2.2. Let G be a ribbon graph with a proper ribbon e, and let G + in=1 ei be the ribbon graph obtained by adding n parallel ribbons e1, e2, · · · , en to the ribbon e (see Figure 2.1). Then

EG+ni=1 ei (z) = EG(z) + (2n+1 - 2)z2 EG/e(z).

Proof. We first show the proof of

(2.3)

EG+e1(z) = EG(z) + 2z2 EG/e(z).

Let A  E(G + e1), A1  E(G), A2  E(G/e). It is easy to see that e(G + e1) = e(G/e) + 2 = e(G) + 1. There are three cases.

Case 1 : Suppose that e1  A and e  A, and let A1 = A - e1. Since the ribbon graph A1 i1s obtained from A by deleting the multiple edge e1, which decreases the number of faces by 1, we have

(2.4)

f (A) = f (A1) + 1.

We use the fact that the complement of A in E(G + e1) is equal to the complement of A1 in E(G), then

(2.5)

f (Ac) = f (A1c ).

4

QIYAO CHEN AND YICHAO CHEN

Thus, by Theorem 2.1,

eu((G + e1)|A ) = 2c(G + e1) + e(G + e1) - f (A) - f (Ac)

= 2c(G) + e(G) + 1 - f (A1) - 1 - f (A1c ) by (2.4) and (2.5)

(2.6)

= eu(G|A1 ).

Case 2 : Assume that e1, e  Ac, and let A = A1. Obviously,

(2.7)

f (A) = f (A1).

Because A1c is obtained from Ac by deleting the multiple edge e1, which decreases the number of faces by 1, then

(2.8)

f (Ac) = f (A1c ) + 1.

Hence

eu((G + e1)|A ) = 2c(G + e1) + e(G + e1) - f (A) - f (Ac) by (2.1)

= 2c(G) + e(G) + 1 - f (A1) - f (A1c ) - 1 by (2.7) and (2.8)

(2.9)

= eu(G|A1 ).

Let A = {A|e1, e  A}  {A|e1, e  Ac}, A1 = {A1|e  A1}, A2 = {A1|e  A1c }, then

   zeu (G+e1)|A =

zeu G|A1 +

zeu G|A1 by (2.6) and (2.9)

AA

A1A1

A1A2

(2.10)

= EG(z).

Case 3 : Let e1  Ac, e  A, and we let A2 = A/e. Since A2 is obtained from A by contracting proper edge e and A2c is obtained from Ac by contracting proper edge e1. Since that contraction does not change the number of faces,

(2.11)

f (A) = f (A2), f (Ac) = f (A2c ).

Therefore,

eu((G + e1)|A ) = 2c(G + e1) + e(G + e1) - f (A) - f (Ac) by (2.1)

= 2c(G/e) + e(G/e) + 2 - f (A2) - f (A2c ) by (2.11)

(2.12)

= eu((G/e)|A2 ) + 2.

Similarly, Formula (2.12) also holds for the case: e  Ac, and e1  A. Let A = {A|e1  Ac, e  A}  {A|e  Ac, e1  A}, and then

(2.13)

 zeu (G+e1)|A

= 2z2 EG/e(z) by (2.12)

= 2z2 EG/e(z) + EG(z).

(2.14)

EG+ni=1 ei (z) = EG+ni=-11 ei (z) + 2z2 E(G+ni=-11 ei)/en-1 (z).

Recall that the ribbons e, e1, e2, · · · , en-2 in (G + in=-11 ei)/en-1 are all loops, and the ribbon graph G/e is obtained from (G + in=-11 ei)/en-1 by deleting n - 1 loops. Thus, from Proposition 3.2 in [GMT20],

(2.15)

E(G+ni=-11 ei)/en-1 (z) = 2n-1 EG/e(z).

(2.14), (2.15) and (2.3) clearly imply (2.2). The theorem follows.

By using the theorem above, we will find an infinite family of ribbon graphs as a counterexample to Conjecture 1.1. Example 2.1. Let G and G + in=1 ei be the ribbon graphs of Figure 2.3. It is easy to see that EG(z) = 8z5 + 16z4 + 8z2, and EG/e(z) = 4z4 + 4z3 + 8z2. Thus by Theorem 2.2, we have
EG+ni=1 ei (z) = EG(z) + (2n+1 - 2)z2 EG/e(z) = (2n+3 - 8)z16 + 2n+3z5 + 2n+4z4 + 8z2.
It is quite obvious that the polynomial above is neither an odd nor an even polynomial, also it's not interpolating.

2.2. A solution to the Problem 1.2. In this subsection, we describe the effects of adding multiple edges, subdivisions, and joins on the restricted orientable partial- polynomial. The restricted orientable partial- ribbon graph of G is the orientable graph G|A. For short, we let EG|O(z) denote the restricted orientable partial- polynomial of ribbon graph G.
Lemma 2.3. Let G be a ribbon graph, then EG|O(z) = EG|A |O(z).
Proof. Let A1  E(G), and A  E(G). For each orientable graph G|A1 , there exists B  E(G|A ) such that the orientable graph of (G|A )|B and G|A1 are the same.

Remark For any non-orientable ribbon graph G, it can be transformed into an orientable graph G|A. Lemma 2.3 shows that it suffices to consider the case
that G is orientable.

Lemma 2.4. Let G be a ribbon graph, then the number of the restricted orientable partial- ribbon graphs of G is 2v(G)-1.

Proof. By [GMT21a], we know that the proportion of partial- duals of G that

are

orientable

is

1 2(G)

.

There are 2e(G) spanning subgraphs in G, thus, the

number of the restricted orientable partial- ribbon graphs of G is

2e(G) 2(G)

=

2e(G) 2e(G)-v(G)+1

=

2v(G)-1.

Let e be a ribbon of G, and let A be a subset of E(G), we define eu0(G|A ) and eu1(G|A ) as e  A and e / A of Euler genus of orientable graph G|A,

respectively. Similarly, we let f 0(G|A ) and f 1(G|A ), respectively, denote the

number of faces of orientable graph G|A with e  A and e / A. And let

fm0 ax(G)

=

max{ f 0(G|A)|e



A},

f

A}.

Theorem 2.5. Let G be a ribbon graph with a proper ribbon e, and let G + in=1 ei be the ribbon graph obtained by adding n parallel ribbons e1, e2, · · · , en to the ribbon e (see Figure 2.1). For sufficiently large n, the polynomial EG+ni=1 ei|O(z) is not even-interpolating.

Proof. Suppose that EG+ni=1 ei|O(z) is even-interpolating. We need to analysis the number of faces for orientable graphs G|A and (G + in=1 ei)|A .

ON AN OPEN PROBLEM AND A CONJECTURE OF GROSS, MANSOUR AND TUCKER 7

If e / A, and G|A is an orientable graph, then f (G|A ) = f 1(G|A ). We let A = A, thus (G + in=1 ei)|A is also an orientable graph, and

(2.16)

  f ((G + ei)|A ) = f 1((G + ei)|A )

i=1

= f 1(G|A ) + n,

because G|A is obtained from (G + in=1 ei)|A by deleting n multiple ribbons e1, e2, · · · , en, and deleting a multiple ribbon will reduce one face.
Otherwise, put e  A0, suppose that the ribbon graph G|A0 is an orientable graph, then f (G|A0 ) = f 0(G|A0 ). Due to ei  e is a 2-cycle in G + in=1 ei, then let A0 = A0  in=1 ei, thus (G + in=1 ei)|A0 is also an orientable graph. Since the ribbon graph G|A0 is obtained from (G + in=1 ei)|A0 by deleting n twisted multiple edges e1, e2, · · · , en, and the deletion does not change the number of faces, it follows that

(2.17)

  f ((G + n ei)|A0 ) = f 0((G + n ei)|A0 )

i=1

i=1

= f 0(G|A0 ).

According to the relationship between f 1(G|A ) and f 0(G|A0 ), we have the following two cases.
Case 1 : f 1(G|A )  f 0(G|A0 ). By Euler formula,

(2.18)

eu0(G|A0 ) = 2c(G) + e(G) + n - v(G) - f 0(G|A0 )  2c(G) + e(G) + n - v(G) - f 1(G|A) = eu1(G|A ),

 eu0((G + n ei)|A0 ) = 2c(G) + e(G) + n - v(G) - f 0(G|A0 ) by (2.17)
i=1

(2.19)

= eu0(G|A0 ) + n,

n
 eu1((G + ei)|A ) = 2c(G) + e(G) + n - v(G) - f 1(G|A ) - n by (2.16)

(2.20)

= eu1(G|A ).

8

QIYAO CHEN AND YICHAO CHEN

Moreover, by (2.18), we get eu0(G|A0 ) + n  eu1(G|A ), and because of the fact that EG+ni=1 ei |O(z) is even-interpolating, there is [eu1((G + in=1 ei)|A ), eu0((G + in=1 ei)|A0 )] in supp( EG+ni=1 ei |O)(z). Since there are only even numbers in [eu1((G + in=1 ei)|A ), eu0((G + in=1 ei)|A0 )] (the Euler genus of orientable graph is even), it follows that the size of [eu1((G + in=1 ei)|A ), eu0((G + in=1 ei)|A0 )] is

(2.21)

eu0(G|A0 )

by (2.19) and (2.20)

By Lemma 2.4, there are 2v(G)-1 orientable ribbon graphs in (G + in=1 ei)|A . Even if the number of faces of the restricted orientable partial- ribbon graph of (G + in=1 ei) are different, there are only 2v(G)-1 different numbers. By (2.21), for sufficiently large n, there must be

Hence, contradicting the assumption that EG+ni=1 ei |O(z) is even-interpolating. We have proved the Case 1.
Case 2 : f 1(G|A ) < f 0(G|A0 ). Recall that the number of faces in (G + in=1 ei)|A has f 0(G|A0 ) and f 1(G|A ) + n. Therefore, when n increases, we have
f 1(G|A ) + n  f 0(G|A0 ).

The remainder of the proof is analogous to that in Case 1 and so is omitted.

Remark From Lemma 2.5, we know that not all multiple ribbon graphs G + in=1 ei are even-interpolating. I.e., for sufficiently large n, whether EG|O(z) is even-interpolating or not, EG+ni=1 ei|O(z) is not even-interpolating.
Next, we give a lower bound for EG+ni=1 ei |O(z) is not even-interpolating for the number n.
Theorem 2.6. Let G be a ribbon graph with a proper ribbon e, and let G + in=1 ei be the ribbon graph obtained by adding n parallel ribbons e1, e2, · · · , en to the ribbon e (see Figure 2.1).

then

EG+ni=1 ei |O(z) is not even-interpolating.

Proof. Suppose that EG+ni=1 ei|O(z) is even-interpolating. We observe that the number of faces of eu0min(G + in=1 ei) is fm0 ax(G + in=1 ei), and the number of faces of eu1max(G + in=1 ei) is fm1 in(G + in=1 ei). Let e  A0, e / A1, assume that both G|A0 and G|A1 are orientable graphs, then f (G|A0 ) = f 0(G|A0 ), f (G|A1 ) = f 1(G|A1 ).

For Item (1), we have

(2.22)

f 1(G|A1 ) = f 0(G|A0 ) = fm1 in(G) = fm0 ax(G).

that

which

implies that we should consider two cases.

Case 1 : If fm0 ax(G + e1) = fm0 ax(G) + 1. Note that deleting an even number
of twisted multiple edges does not change the number of faces. Then, when n is even, the maximum value of f 0(G + in=1 ei) is the maximum value of f 0(G), that is

for odd n. Let A1 = A1. It is easy to see that (G + in=1 ei)|A1 is an orientable graph,
and f ((G + in=1 ei)|A1 ) = f 1((G + in=1 ei)|A1 ). Clearly, for any ribbon subset A1 of G + in=1 ei, we have f 1((G + in=1 ei)|A1 ) = f 1(G|A1 ) + n. Furthermore,

Recall that EG+ni=1 ei |O(z) is even-interpolating, so, there is [eu1max(G + in=1 ei), eu0min(G + in=1 ei)] in supp( EG+ni=1 ei |O)(z). Note that the Euler genus of the orientable graph (G + in=1 ei)|A is either smaller than eu1max(G + in=1 ei) or larger than eu0min(G + in=1 ei), so, there are only two numbers eu1max(G + in=1 ei), eu0min(G + in=1 ei) in [eu1max(G + in=1 ei), eu0min(G + in=1 ei)].

of n can be rewritten using the definition of fm0 in(G) and fm1 ax(G). The result follows.

Proposition 2.7. Let G = G1  G2. Then EG|O(z) = EG1 |O(z) EG2|O(z).

Proof. If G|A, G1|A1 and G2|A2 are orientable graphs, then for each A, there exist A1  E(G1) and A2  E(G2), such that A = A1  A2, and

The result follows.

Theorem 2.8. Let G be a ribbon graph with a ribbon e, and let H be obtained from G

by subdividing e into edges e1 and e2. Then

(2.31)

EH|O(z) = 2 EG|O(z).

Proof. Let A  E(G), and A1  E(H). According to the relationship between e1, e2 and A1, we distinguish three cases.
Case 1: Suppose that e1  A1, e2 / A1, and let A = (A1 - e1)  e. Because H|A1 petrialize the ribbon e1 and G|A petrialize the ribbon e, notice that e2 in H|A1 is a proper edge, thus, f (H|A1 ) = f (G|A ). Moreover, if G|A is an orientable graph, then H|A1 is also an orientable graph.
Furthermore, the proof for e2  A1 and e1 / A1 is omitted since it is essentially the same as that just given for e1  A1, e2 / A1.
Case 2: When e1, e2  A1, and e / A. Let A = A1 - e1 - e2. Since G|A is obtained from H|A1 by deleting two twisted edges e1, e2. Then, f (H|A1 ) = f (G|A ), and if G|A is an orientable graph, thus H|A1 is also an orientable graph.
Case 3: Assume that e1, e2 / A1, and e / A. Let A = A1, if G|A is an orientable graph, then H|A1 is also an orientable graph. Obviously, f (H|A1 ) = f (G|A ).
Note that in Case 1-Case 3, we have f (H|A1 ) = f (G|A ), that is

(2.32)

eu(H|A1 ) = eu(G|A ).

From the discussion above, we have EH|O(z) = 2 EG|O(z).

Remark Applying Theorem 2.8, we can turn a multiple graph into a simple graph, so combined with the previous Theorem, not all simple ribbon graphs G are even-interpolating.
Now, let us give some examples to illustrate the above results.
Figure 2.4. D3,3
Denote by Dn the planar dipole ribbon graph, we let Dn,n denote the ribbon graph obtained from subdividing n ribbons of Dn, as shown in Figure 2.4. Example 2.2. Let G be a ribbon graph with only one edge e, it is easy to see that
1 EG|O(z) = 2. Then we add n - 1 multiple edges ei of e to G, and get the planar ribbon graph Dn, i.e., G + in=-11 ei is isomorphic to Dn. Since the ribbon graph G + e1 is D2, we see that
fm0 ax(D2) = 2 = f 0(G|A ) + 1. Thus, by Theorem 2.6 (1), when n  5, the restricted-orientable partial- polynomial of planar Dn is not even-interpolating.
By the definition of planar ribbon graph Dn,n and Theorem 2.8, we get EDn,n |O(z) = 2n EDn |O(z).
Hence, when n  5, the restricted-orientable partial- polynomial of simple graph Dn,n is not even-interpolating.
Example 2.3. Let Cm be the planar ribbon m-cycle. Evidently, EC2|O(z) = 2. Using the fact that Cm is obtainable from C2 with any ribbon subdivided m - 2 times, we have
ECm|O(z) = 2m-2 EC2|O(z) by Theorem 2.8 = 2m-1.

Example 2.4. Let G and G + in=1 ei be the ribbon graphs in Figure 2.6. Clearly, EG|O(z) = 4 + 4z2, fm0 ax(G) = 3, fm1 in(G) = 1, and
fm0 ax(G + e1) = 2 < fm0 ax(G). Therefore, by Theorem 2.6 (2), when n  2 - 1 + 4 = 5, the restricted-orientable partial- polynomial of planar G + in=1 ei is not even-interpolating.
