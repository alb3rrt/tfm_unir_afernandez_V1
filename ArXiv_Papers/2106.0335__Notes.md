## Abstract

Let $p$ be a prime. A cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-$p$ group is a pair consisting of a pro-$p$ group $G$ together with a continuous $G$-module $\mathbb{Z}_p(\theta)$ isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p$ as an abelian pro-$p$ group, such that the natural map in cohomology $H^1(G,\mathbb{Z}_p(\theta)/p^n)\to H^1(G,\mathbb{Z}_p(\theta)/p)$ is surjective for every $n\geq1$. One has a 1-cyclotomic oriented pro-$p$ group if cohomological Kummerianity holds for every closed subgroup. By Kummer theory, the maximal pro-$p$ Galois group of a field containing a root of 1 of order $p$ together with the cyclotomic character is 1-cyclotomic. We prove that cohomological Kummerianity is preserved by certain quotients of pro-$p$ groups, and we extend the group-theoretic characterization of cohomologically Kummerian oriented pro-$p$ groups, established by I.~Efrat and the author, to the non-finitely generated case. We employ these results to find interesting new examples of pro-$p$ groups which do not occur as absolute Galois groups, which other methods fail to detect.
