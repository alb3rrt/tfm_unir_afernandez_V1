Abstract
The counting of the dimension of the space of U (N ) × U (N ) × U (N ) polynomial invariants of a complex 3-index tensor as a function of degree n is known in terms of a sum of squares of Kronecker coefficients. For n  N , the formula can be expressed in terms of a sum of symmetry factors of partitions of n denoted Z3(n). We derive the large n all-orders asymptotic formula for Z3(n) making contact with high order results previously obtained numerically. The derivation relies on the dominance in the sum, of partitions with many parts of length 1. The dominance of other small parts in restricted partition sums leads to related asymptotic results. The result for the 3-index tensor observables gives the large n asymptotic expansion for the counting of bipartite ribbon graphs with n edges, and for the dimension of the associated Kronecker permutation centralizer algebra. We explain how the different terms in the asymptotics are associated with probability distributions over ribbon graphs. The large n dominance of small parts also leads to conjectured formulae for the asymptotics of invariants for general d-index tensors. The coefficients of 1/n in these expansions involve Stirling numbers of the second kind along with restricted partition sums.

1 Introduction
Tensor models are generalizations of random matrix theories where the random variables are multi-index tensors. New results on the large N expansion of these models have attracted continuing active interest in theoretical physics [1, 2], in particular in connection with random discrete geometries [3, 4], quantum gravity [5], condensed matter physics, 2D topological field theories [6] and models of black hole physics [7, 8, 9].
We will consider complex tensor variables i1,··· ,id transforming as VNd under a product of unitary groups U(N )×d, where VN is the fundamental representation of U(N ). A basis of invariants of U(N )×d is built using index contractions between n copies of  and n copies of its complex conjugate, ¯ i1,··· ,id which transforms V¯Nn, where V¯N is the complex conjugate representation of U(N). The invariant observables are useful as interaction terms in tensor model actions. Their enumeration is also of interest in the thermodynamics of quantum mechanical tensor theories [10] and the investigation of their holographic duals [11, 12, 13]. The leading order large n asymptotics has been discussed in the physics literature in [10, 13, 14].
2

In [6] the counting and correlators of the rank-d complex tensor invariants have been given using permutation equivalences. A bijection of the permutation basis of invariants with branched covers of the 2-sphere was given and formulations of the counting and correlators in terms of 2D topological field theory were described. In [15, 16] it was shown that the invariants at degree n form a basis for an associative algebra K(n), denoted the Kronecker permutation centralizer algebra, which has a decomposition into blocks of size equal to the Kronecker coefficient for triples of Young diagrams with n boxes. The algebra has implications for the structure of tensor model correlators [6, 16]. The algebraic perspectives on tensor model correlators have been developed in [17, 18, 19]. Similar techniques have been applied to orthogonal invariants [20]. Moreover, in computational complexity theory [21, 22, 23, 24, 25], Kronecker coefficients form a subject of active interest. Very recently, building on the results of [16], a question of Murnaghan [26, 27] (discussed among a class of positivity problems in representation theory in [28]) about the existence of a combinatorial interpretation of the Kronecker coefficient has motivated a construction based on bipartite ribbon graphs [29]: for every triple of Young diagrams with n boxes, the Kronecker coefficient counts vectors spanning a specified sub-lattice of the lattice of bipartite ribbon graphs of n edges. The vectors are constructed as null vectors of an integer matrix. The importance of Kronecker coefficients in mathematics gives additional motivations for detailed studies of the properties of K(n). The asymptotics of the counting of tensor model observables gives the asymptotics of the dimension of K(n).
The counting formulae in [6, 16] for 3-index tensor observables, in the case N  n, is recalled as

Z3(n) = Sym(p) =

C(R1, R2, R3)2

pn

R1 ,R2 ,R3 n

(1.1)

with p = (p1, . . . , pn) a partition of n with symmetry factor Sym(p), and C(R1, R2, R3) the so-called Kronecker coefficient associated with three Young diagrams R1, R2, and R3 with n boxes. For n > N , the Young diagrams R1, R2, R3 are restricted to have no more than N rows. This counting has also been obtained with motivations from quantum entanglement in [30, 31]. The finite N cutoff is a feature related to Schur-Weyl duality which plays an important role in connection with the stringy exclusion principle [32] and giant gravitons [33] in the AdS/CFT correspondence [34, 35, 36] (for a review of the applications of Schur-Weyl duality in this context see [37]). The asymptotics of (1.1) at large n has been the subject of a very interesting study by Kotesovec up to high order using direct numerical fitting techniques and the results are available on the OEIS [38]. In this work, we investigate the asymptotic expansion of the counting of rank-d tensor invariants. We prove the asymptotic expansion series at all orders for d = 3. Theorem 1 and Theorem 3 are our main results. We are able to match the series [38] and extend it to all orders. We find that the sum over partitions p in (1.1) is dominated by partitions in which most of the parts have length 1: these are partitions of the form [1n-k, q] where q is a partition of k, with k fixed as n tends to infinity. Using this dominance of parts of

3

length 1, we also conjecture the form of the coefficients of the asymptotic series for rank d invariants.
This plan of the paper is as follows. The next section introduces our notation, discusses main features of the asymptotic series and delivers our main result, namely the asymptotic expansion of the counting of rank d = 3 of tensor invariants. In the course of this proof, an important role is played by a partition of the set P(n) of all partitions of n into subsets Pm(n), which are partitions of n where the minimal part length is m. Corresponding to these subsets we define Z3;m(n). We show that large n asymptotic series for Z3(n) is the same as that for Z3;1(n). At the conclusion of this section we explain how the different terms in the asymptotic expansion can be associated with different probability distributions over tensor invariants, or equivalently over bi-partite ribbon graphs. In section 3 we present formulae for the asymptotic series of Z3;m(n), with any finite m which is kept fixed as n tends to infinity. We then show that the coefficients of the 1/n expansion can be expressed in terms of the Stirling numbers of the second kind along with sums over symmetry factors of restricted partitions. Section 4 elaborates some conjectures about the expansion for arbitrary rank d invariants, based again on the dominance of small parts. A conclusion follows in section 5 where we discuss future research directions motivated by this work. The paper closes with two appendices: Appendix A collects the proof of the main lemma which establishes the dominance of small cycles, while Appendix B provides the codes that yield the coefficients of the asymptotic series expansion of tensor invariants at d = 3 at arbitrary order n.

2 Asymptotic counting of 3-index tensor invariants

In tensor models we encounter a counting problem involving complex tensor variables ijk

and and

V¯¯Nijkiswthhiechantrtai-nfusfnodrmamiennVtaNl 3oaf nUd(NV¯N).3

of U(N), where The counting of

VN is the degree n

fundamental of U(N) invariant polynomials

when n  N is given by

Z3(n) = Sym(p) =

C(R1, R2, R3)2

pn

R1 ,R2 ,R3 n

(2.1)

p is a partition of n. It is specified by non-negative integers (p1, p2, · · · , pn) which are the numbers of parts of length 1, 2, · · · , n. The symmetry factor of the partition is

n
Sym(p) = ipipi!
i

(2.2)

p specifies the cycle structure of a permutation in Sn : p1 is the number of cycles of length
1, p2 is the number of cycles of length 2, etc. For a permutation  with cycle structure p, Sym(p) is the number of permutations   Sn satisfying -1 = . Thus this is the

4

order of the centralizer of any  with a given cycle structure p. In the second equality
of (2.1), R1, R2, R3 are Young diagrams with n boxes. C(R1, R2, R3) is the Kronecker coefficient for the triple of Young diagrams. The counting has been detailed in [6, 16],
and has been generalized to arbitrary rank d tensor i1i2...id. The asymptotics of Z3(n) at large n has been calculated by evaluating the sum for n
up to 20000 and fitting to the form n!P (1/n) where P is a power series in 1/n [38]:

Z3(n)  n!(1 + 2/n2 + 5/n3 + 23/n4 + 106/n5 + 537/n6 + · · · )

(2.3)

Remarkably, the coefficients in P are all non-negative integers, this has been verified for the first 132 terms.
This remarkable integrality is suggestive of some underlying simplicity in the asymptotics. Below we propose a way to understand this simplicity. The idea is to identify a subset of the partitions in (2.1) which dominate in the large n limit.

2.1 A partition of the set of partitions of integer n
Z3(n) is a sum over partitions of n, denoted p  n. Let us call this set P(n). For example P(3) is the set

P(3) = {[1, 1, 1], [1, 2], [3]}

(2.4)

Each square bracket contains positive integers adding to 3. The different entries within a bracket are the parts of the partition. We also use the exponent notation

{[13], [1, 2], [3]}

(2.5)

Each partition of n has integers i with multiplicities pi. In order to understand the asymptotics, it will be useful to describe P(n) as a disjoint
union of subsets. We define Pm(n) to be the subset of P(n) consisting of partitions which have the smallest part equal to m. In the above case

P1(3) = {[13], [1, 2]} P2(3) =  P3(3) = {[3]}

(2.6)

These subsets are evidently disjoint : for any p there is a unique integer m which is the minimum part appearing in p. Hence

P(3) = P1(3)  P2(3)  P3(3) = P1(3)  P3(3) For n = 4 we have

(2.7)

P(4) = {[14], [12, 2], [1, 3], [22], [4]}

5

P1(4) = {[14], [12, 2], [1, 3]} P2(4) = {[2, 2]} P3(4) =  P4(4) = {[4]}
and

(2.8)

P(4) = P1(4)  P2(4)  P3(4)  P4(4) = P1(4)  P2(4)  P4(4)

(2.9)

Note that above m > n/2, Pm(n) =  unless m = n, and then Pn(n) = {[n]}. In general we have

P(n) = P1(n)  P2(n)  · · ·  Pn/2(n)  Pn(n)

(2.10)

For each of the subsets in the decomposition (2.10), we can define the corresponding sum over Sym(p). First observe that we can write

Z3(n) = Sym(p) =

Sym(p)

pn

pP (n)

(2.11)

For the sums of symmetry factors of partitions restricted to the subsets Pm(n) of P(n), we define

Z3;m(n) =

Sym(p) =

Sym(p)

pPm (n)

p1

pn =···=pm-1

=0;

pm>0

(2.12)

The conditions p  n, p1 = · · · = pm-1 = 0 and pm > 0 give an equivalent way to express the restriction to Pm(n). In terms of these restricted partition sums, we have

n
Z3(n) = Z3;m(n) .
m=1

(2.13)

It is understood that, for n/2 < m  (n - 1), Z3;m(n) = 0 since Pm(n) is empty in this range, as explained above.
For the subsequent discussion, it is also useful to define

Pm+(n) = Pm(n)  Pm+1(n)  · · ·  Pn(n)

(2.14)

Thus

P1+ (n) = P1(n)  P2(n)  P3(n) · · ·  P(n) = P(n)
P2+ (n) = P2(n)  P3(n) · · ·  P(n) = P(n) \ P1(n)

6

P3+ (n) = P3(n)  P4(n)  · · ·  P(n) = P(n) \ {P1(n)  P2(n)} ...
Pm+ (n) = P(n) \ {P1(n)  P2(n)  · · ·  Pm-1(n)}

(2.15)

Z3;m+ (n) =

Sym(p) =

Sym(p) .

pPm+ (n)

pn p1=···=pm-1=0

(2.16)

2.2 The leading asymptotics
Consider some of the terms in the sum (2.11). For p = [1n], p1 = n and all other pi = 0, we have Sym(p) = n!. This very simple fact has been used to very good effect, to bound Kronecker coefficients in [25]. Consider another p = [n], i.e. pn = 1 and all other pi = 0, then observe that Sym(p) = n. The function Sym(p) is such that for a multiplicity pi of cycles, we get factorials of the multiplicity, while the length i of the cycle we get a factor i. So large multiplicities of cycles give dominant contributions at large n. This will be a driving principle in our reasoning.
In the following, we will prove that the set of all p for fixed n can be organised in such a way as to identify the dominant subsets at large n. The main idea is based on the fact that Z3(n) is dominated by partitions of the form p = [1n-k, q] of n, where q is a partition of k with no parts of length 1. To get a finite order in the asymptotic expansion we need to keep k finite as n is taken to infinity. Noting that Sym([1n-k, q]) = (n - k)!Sym(q), consider the finite sum

S3,1;K(n) = (n - k)!

Sym(q) = (n - k)!

Sym(q)

k=0

qP2+ (k)

k=0

qk|q1=0

(2.17)

The subscript 1 in S3;1;K indicates that we are isolating the parts of length 1 and treating the remaining parts as a restricted partition q with no parts of length 1, that is, q1 = 0. Let us illustrate in greater detail that sum. Taking K = 0, we have

S3;1;0(n) = Sym([1n]) = n!

(2.18)

Note that K = 1 does not allow any partition q with k = 1, since k = 1 means there are n - 1 parts of length 1, which forces the remaining part to also be of length 1. Let us expand (2.17) taking K = 4. we obtain

S3;1;4(n) = Sym([1n]) + Sym([1n-2, 2]) + Sym([1n-3, 3]) + Sym([1n-4, 4]) + Sym([1n-4, 22]) = n! + 2(n - 2)! + 3(n - 3)! + (n - 4)!(4 + 8)

(2.19)

The k = 2 term gives corrections at order 1/n2 and higher, the k = 3 gives a correction at order 1/n3 and higher. The sum S3;1;4 agrees with the numerical asymptotics of (2.3) (from [38]) up to 1/n4 corrections.
We are in a position to formulate our first result. Consider the sum (2.17) re-expressed
in the following form and the series: for K  n,

S3;1;K(n) = n!

K

1 n(n - 1) · · · (n - k + 1)

Sym(q)

k=2

qk:q1=0

S3 ;1;K (n) = S3,1;K (n)/n!

(2.20)

Note that S3 ,1;K(n) has an expansion in 1/n at large n. We regard this finite sum as a tool to construct a polynomial in 1/n of order K, and by taking K arbitrarily large and
finite (while n is taken to infinity) we obtain an infinite series in 1/n. Consider S3,1(n) as the sequence of functions S3,1;K(n), for all K, and introduce S3 ;1(n) as the sequence S3,1;K (n)/n!, for all K.
The following statement holds:

Theorem 1. Z3;1(n) = Z3;1(n)/n! is asymptotic to S3 ;1(n) in the large n limit. This means we need to show that (see chap. 12.6 [39]), for fixed and arbitrary K  0

2.3 Proof of the asymptotics

We first prove an important fact that partitions with small parts have a dominant Sym(p).

Lemma 1. k  0 an integer

k even , k odd and k  11 ,

Sym[2k/2]  Sym[q], q  k, q1 = 0

Sym[3, 2(k-3)/2]  Sym[q],

q  k, q1 = 0

(2.24) (2.25)

Proof. See Appendix A.

Lemma 2. Let K and n be two positive integers, such that K  n, and k  {K, . . . , n}. Let P1(k) be the number of partitions of k with no parts of length 1. The function f (n, k) defined by

f (n, k)

=

(n

- n!

k)!

P1(k)2k/2(k/2)!

,

for k even,

f (n, k)

=

(n

- n!

k)!

P1(k)2(k-3)/2

((k

- 3)/2)!

,

for k odd,

(2.26)

is maximised by f (n, K).

Proof. Let us start with a few comments to explain our proof strategy. Numerical inves-

tigation shows that the function decreases as k increases and reaches a minimum near

k = n. In the following, we will estimate the position of the minimal as n becomes large.

For k above that minimum, the function increases again but remains at k = n well below

the value at k = K.

We will prove that the slope of f (n, k) as a function of k is negative at k = K and

that there is just one minimum in the range k = K to k = n. Further, we prove (easily)

that the value at k = K exceeds the value at k = n.

When k is close to K, which is order 1 as n  , then we know that f vanishes,

simply

because

f

behaves

like

(n-K )! n!

=

O(1/nK ).

When k is close to n, i.e.

(n - k)

is order 1, then we also know that f (n, k) is vanishing at large n. To see this consider

f (n, n) in the even case of (2.26)

f (n, n)

=

1 n!

P1

(n)2n/2(n/2)!



eBn2n/2(n/2)! n!

-n--- 

0

(2.27)

where we used a standard result for the asymptotics of P1(n) where B is a constant, which we give shortly. The odd case is similar.
We will consider (n - k)  n for 0 <  < 1, and thus interpolating between these two limits. For any 1 >  > 0, k and (n - k) both go to infinity as n goes to infinity.
So we can use the asymptotic form of P1(k). The asymptotic behaviour of P1(k) is easily

9

derived from the asymptotics of partition numbers because P1(k) = P (k) - P (k - 1) (see for example [43]):

The positive solution is

k = -1/2 + n and yields

 k = n - n + 1/4

(2.35)

which confirms (n - k)  n and also k1/2 < n - k.

The above treatment shows that for large n and (n - k)  n,  ]0, 1[, there is a single extremum of f (n, k), when k  n.

which

departs

(2.33)

by

an irrelevant term. Indeed, -5/2k does not contribute in the remaining analysis and we

11

arrive at the exact same result in the same approximation. Thus, (2.35) holds in both regimes k1/2  n - k and k1/2 > n - k.

Appendix B gathers numerical evaluations of the minimum value of f (n, k). It shows that the approximation kmin  n - kmin holds for a range of values of n. We have set n  [20, 80] for n even, and n  [21, 81], for n odd.

Now we address the slope of the function at k = K and at k = n. Slope at K. We compare f (n, K) and f (n, K + 2), (notice that K and K + 2 share the same parity) at large n  K,

f (n, K) f (n, K + 2)

=

(n - K)G(K)



1

(2.37)

with a finite function G(K). Thus f is decreasing at K.

Slope at n. Consider n even, we compare f (n, n) and f (n, n - 2), at large n  K. We get

f (n, n) f (n, n - 2)

=

1 2

P1(n) 2n/2 P1(n - 2) 2(n-2)/2

1,

(2.38)

with P1(n)  P1(n - 1). Thus f is increasing between n - 2 and n. On the other hand, if n odd and large, we have

f (n, n) f (n, n - 2)

=

1 P1(n) 2(n-3)/2 2 P1(n - 2) 2(n-5)/2

(2.39)

Again, w conclude tha f increases between n - 2 and n.

f (n, K) is the max. The last piece of information we need is the comparison between f (n, K) and f (n, n). As K is a finite small integer, we want to show that f (n, K)  f (n, n) at large n. We note that k = K, . . . , n could be even or odd, and therefore we could only compare K and n having the same parity.
Assuming that K and n are even, for n large and finite K, using Stirling approximation and (2.28), we have

f (n, K) f (n, n)

because, at large n and finite K, nn/2 dominates eBn+n/2. Above G(K) and G1(K) are

(2.41)

and the inequality can be justified once by exactly the same argument at large n and finite K. This ends the proof of the lemma.

Theorem 1 is a straightforward corollary of on the following statement.

Theorem 2. The remainder (2.22) obeys the limit: limn Rn,K = 0.

Proof. Let us separate the remainder into two parts:

Rn,K = R+n,K + R-n,K

(2.42)

where R+n,K is a sum over even k and R-n,K is a sum over odd k. To write explicit formulae for these, we will need to treat K even and odd separately.

K is odd. We seek an upper bound for

R+n,K = nK

n

(n - k)! n!

Sym(q)

k=K+1; k even

qk

q1=0

(2.43)

Lemma 1 shows that Sym(q) is maximised by q = [2k/2] for k even. The number of terms in the sum over q is P1(k). Hence, we claim

R+n,K < nK

n

(n

- k)! n!

P1(k)2k/2(k/2)!



R~ +n,K

k=K+1; k even

(2.44)

It is convenient to separate R~+n,K into two parts: the first term in the sum and the rest.

for CK a constant. The first term scales as 1/n, so vanishes at large n. Lemma 2 implies that the summand in the second term of (2.45) is maximised by the
first term of that sum provided that n  K + 3. Therefore, the sum in (2.45) is bounded from above by

(2.47)

The factor (n - K - 3 + 2)/2 bounds from above the number of terms in the sum over k (for n even it is exact, for n odd it exceeds the number of terms by 1/2). At large n and fixed K + 3  n, we expand the previous expression as

for some finite positive constants CK, CK > 0. This goes to zero at large n.

(2.48)

K is even. Although in the following we keep the same notation, the reader should be aware that the expressions may designate different quantities. We adopt the same strategy as above and find upper bound for the remainder and show that it goes to 0 as n tends to infinity. We have

R+n,K = nK

n

(n - k)! n!

Sym(q)

k=K+2; k even

Once again, k is even, so Lemma 1 provides a bound on R+n,K as follows

This ends the proof of the theorem.

(2.57)

lim
n

nK (Z3 (n)

-

S3 ;1;K (n))

=

0

(2.59)

Note first that Z3(n) expands as

Z3(n) = Z3;1(n) + Z3;2+(n)

(2.60)

Z3;2+(n) sums over partitions with no parts of size 1. Lemma 1 teaches that, for all n  0, and even or odd, the maximal Sym[q], among q  n, with q1 = 0, is known.
- Let us focus on the case n even:

Z3;2+(n)  Sym[2n/2]P1(n)

(2.61)

where P1(n) keeps its previous meaning as the number of the partitions of n without parts of size 1. It becomes obvious that

Z3(n)  Z3;1(n) + Sym[2n/2]P1(n)

(2.62)

We rewrite this under the light of Theorem 1:

nK Z3 (n) - S3 ;1;K (n)



nK

S3 ;1;K (n)

+

1 n!

Sym[2n/2]P1(n)



Rn,K

+

nK n!

Sym[2n/2]P1(n)

(2.63)

Taking the limit when n  , using Theorem 2 showing Rn,K  0 and, the fact that nK Sym[2n/2]P1(n)  nn/2+K-3/2eB n-n/2 is suppressed by the denominator n!  nne-n, for any finite K, we obtain the result.
- In the same vein, when n is odd, we have for n > 11 (2.25),

Z3;2+(n)  Sym[3, 2(n-3)/2]P1(n)

(2.64)

which leads, using the same above argument, to a vanishing remainder.

Remark: Note that Z3;1(n) and Z3(n) have the same large n asymptotic expansion. We will discuss a large n characterization of Z3(n) which conjecturally fixes it uniquely in section 3.3.

2.4 Interpretation in terms of probability distributions over bipartite ribbon graphs
It is natural to ask how we should interpret the asymptotic results we have found here. Which tensor invariants dominate in the large n limit? As explained in [6, 16, 29] the
16

tensor invariants of degree n correspond to bi-partite ribbon graphs with n edges. These are in 1-1 correspondence with orbits of an action by Sn on pairs (1, 2)  Sn × Sn. The action of   Sn is given by

(1, 2)  (1-1, 2-1)

(2.65)

For each orbit there is a tensor invariant or bi-partite ribbon graph. Letting r be an index running over the set of bipartite ribbon graphs, we can pick pairs (1(r), 2(r))  Sn × Sn in the orbit. One way to understand asymptotic results is to find configurations that dominate. For example the Plancherel distribution for Young diagrams is dominated by typical Young diagrams with shape close to a limit curve [40]. So is there a class of bi-partite graphs which dominate in the large n limit? The short answer is that rather than dominant ribbon graphs, the explanation that follows from the derivation is that the leading asymptotics is determined by a probability distribution over ribbon graphs.
To understand this, recall the derivation using Burnside Lemma

Z3(n)

=

1 n!

(1-11-1)(2-12-1)

Sn 1,2Sn

=

1 n!

n! Sym(p)

(Sym(p))2

=

Sym(p)

pn

p

(2.66)

which is given and explained in more detail in [6].

The

factor

n! Sym(p)

is

the

number

of permutations  in the conjugacy class p. The two sums over 1, 2 give the factor

(Sym(p))2. Alternatively we can take the sum over (1, 2) outside and write it as a sum

over orbits. We use |Orb (r)| to denote the number of permutation pairs in the orbit of

(1(r), 2(r)) and |Aut (r)| is the number of permutations  leaving fixed the pair (1(r), 2(r)). By the orbit stabilizer theorem we have n!/|Orb (r)| = |Aut (r)|. We will use Aut (r)  [p]

to denote the subset of   Aut (r) which belong to the conjugacy class [p] where the

cycles of  define the partition p of n (we denote this as [] = [p] below):

Z3(n) =

1 n!

For each fixed p, the sum over r gives Sym(p)

Sym(p) =

|Aut(r)  [p]| |Aut (r)|

r

(2.68)

from which the formula (2.66) for Z3(n) as a sum of the symmetry factors. This is a very interesting equation. The LHS is an integer defined entirely in terms of Sn. For any  in the conjugacy class [p], it is the number of permutations   Sn such that -1 = . On the RHS we have a sum over bipartite ribbon graphs with n edges (equivalently over
tensor invariants). Each term is a positive rational number smaller or equal to 1. It is
useful to spell out the derivation of (2.68):

|Aut(r)  [p]| |Aut (r)|

=

|Ornb!(r)||Aut(r)  [p]|

(Sym(p))2

=

1 n!

(Sym(p))2

:[]=[p]

= Sym(p)

(2.69)

We

used

the

fact

the

number

of

permutations

in

the

class

[p]

is

n! Sym(p)

and

the

structure

of the proof is essentially reversing, at fixed p, the steps of (2.66).

The equation (2.68) means that, for each p, we can define a probability distribution

W (p, r) over ribbon graphs

W (p, r)

=

1 |Aut(r)  [p]| Sym(p) |Aut (r)|

(2.70)

Since our asymptotic results have been derived by organising the set of p in the sum
for Z3(n) according to powers of n, each term can be interpreted using W (p, r). Taking p = [1n] which contributes the leading term in the asymptotics of Z3(n), the equation (2.68) becomes

n! =

1 |Aut r|

r

The probability distribution over ribbon graphs is given by

(2.71)

W ([1n], r)

=

1 n!|Aut

(r)|

(2.72)

18

Thus, the leading asymptotics comes from a probability distribution over all bi-partite
ribbon graphs, where each contributes an inverse of the order of its automorphism group. The contribution at order 1/n2 in Z3(n) comes from the [] = [1n-2, 2]. This contribution is associated with the probability distribution

W ([1n-2, 2], r)

=

(n

1 |Aut(r)  [1n-2, 2]| - 2)!2 |Aut (r)|

(2.73)

As a generalization of this link to probability distributions, if we consider the coefficient of

1 (n)(n-1)···(n-k+1)

in

(2.58),

we

have

a

sum

of

symmetry

factors

over

a

finite

set

of

partitions

of the form p = [1n-k, q] with q  k; q1 = 0. The contribution of a given ribbon graph

equivalence class (labelled by r) to this sum is proportional to a probability distribution

over ribbon graphs. Let Sk be the set of partitions of this form specified p = [1n-k, q].

For the subset Sk there is a probability distribution

W (Sk, r) =

1

|Aut(r)  [p]|

pSk Sym(p) pSk |Aut (r)|

(2.74)

It is interesting to describe the geometrical characteristics of the ribbon graphs which lead to the largest contributions for each p. Since ribbon graphs also correspond to Belyi maps (see for example [41]), we may phrase this question in terms of characteristics such as Galois invariants of Belyi maps. We leave these as interesting questions for the future.

3 Asymptotics in terms of Stirling numbers and gen-
eralization to Z3;m
In this section we show that the asymptotic expansion of Z3(n), which is the same as that of Z3;1(n), involves the well-known Stirling numbers of the second kind. This shows that integers obtained by [38] are expressible in terms of symmetry factors of restricted partitions multiplied by these Stirling numbers. The same structure holds true for asymptotic expansions of Z3;m for higher m.

3.2 Z3;m(n) in terms of Stirling numbers
We conjecture here the asymptotic series expansion for Z3;m(n), for general finite m, according to similar arguments given above. We recall that

Z3;m(n) =

Sym(p) =

Sym(p)

pPm (n)

p1

pn =···=pm-1

=0;

pm>0

(3.10)

with m  n. For m > 1, there are in fact more constraints on the partition than p  n, p1 = · · · =
pm-1 = 0, pm > 0, in the above sum (3.10). Indeed, consider the Euclidean division

n = ml1 + l2, 0  l2 < m, l1  1

(3.11)

Two cases should be discussed pertaining to the value of the remainder: either l2 equals 0 or does not.

21

If l2 = 0, then n = ml1 and we claim the dominant term in (3.10) is given by

p = [ml1]

(3.12)

If l2 > 0, then n - l2 = ml1, then the following term should be the dominant one:

q  m + l2

(3.13)

where q should also obey q1 = q2 = · · · = qm = 0. A quick inspection shows the unique possibility q = [m + l2], hence p = [ml1-1, m + l2].
Depending on l2, we use the notation l2=0 = 1, if l2 = 0 and l2=0 = 0, otherwise, and
l2>0 = 1, if l2 > 0 and l2>0 = 0, otherwise. We expand the partial sum

S3;m;K (n) = l2=0 l1!ml1 + l2>0 (l1 - 1)!m(l1-1)(m + l2)

where it is understood that K  l1, as n and, therefore, l1 = (n - l2)/m go to infinity. For l2 = 0, we can further expand S3;m;K(n) and obtain the coefficients of the conjec-
tured asymtotic expansion of Z3;m(n). In an analogous way to the steps leading to (3.3), we introduce

Fm,k(l2) :=

Sym(q)

3.3 Discussion: Non-perturbative asymptotics of Z3(n)

We have established the large n asymptotic series for Z3, Z3;1, both of which have the same large n series. We have argued for and conjectured the large n series for Z3,m, for any m  O(1) as n  . Drawing on analogies with non-perturbative expansions in QFT and quantum mechanics, it is natural to ask whether our knowledge of the asymptotic expansions of Z3;m can be collected into a non-perturbative expansion for Z3. Although Z3 = m Z3;m this is not straightforward since the number of terms in the sum over m goes to infinity as n  .
Let us first explain the analogy in more detail. Instanton expansions in QFT where QFT observables are expressed as an approximation of the form

F

(g)



S0(g)

+

e -1 g

S1(g)

+

e -2 g

S2(g)

+

·

·

·

(3.22)

Here S0(g), S1(g), · · · are power series in powers of g, the coupling constant, which are asymptotic expansions in the limit g  0. The successively higher instanton numbers are exponentially suppressed in the limit. See [44] for a review of this subject.
Based on the analogy, we can ask if it is possible to make sense of an expansion of the form

Z3 n!



S3;1

+

f2(n)S3;2

+

f3(n)S3;3

+···

?

(3.23)

24

S3;1 is a power series analogous to S0(g), the perturbative term in QFT. S3;2, S3;3 · · ·

are

likewise

power

series

in

1 n

analogous

to

S1(g), S2(g) · · ·

in

QFT.

f2(n)

is

super-

exponentially suppressed compared to 1, f3(n) is super-exponentially suppressed com-

pared

to

f2(n)

etc.

As

we

saw,

the

series

S3;1

is

obtained

from

Z3;1 n!

where

Z3;1

(3.10)

is

the

sum of Sym(p) for partitions where the minimum part has length 1. Finite truncations

S3;1;K

are

obtained

by

taking

n



K

and

summing

terms

in

Z3;1 n!

with

n-K

parts

of

length 1.

The term f2(n)S3;2 is obtained from Z3;2/n! which is the sum of Sym(p) for partitions

that have no cycles of length 1 and a non-zero number of parts of length 2. Finite

truncations f2(n)S3;2;K are obtained by taking n  K and considering terms in Z3;2 with at least (n - K) parts of length 2:

f2(n)

=

(n/2)!2n/2 n!

(3.24)

We see that f2(n) is super-exponentially suppressed compared to f1(n) = 1. Similarly f3(n)S3;3 is obtained from Z3;3/n! which is the sum of Sym(p) for partitions having no cycles of length 1, 2 and a minimum part of length 3. f3(n) is the symmetry factor for a partition with the largest number of 3, divided by n!.

f3(n)

=

(n/3)!3n/3 n!

(3.25)

The series S3,3 starts with 1 and any finite order truncation S3;3;K is obtained by taking n  K and summing Sym(p) over partitions having n/3 - K parts of length 3. It is easy to see that f3(n) is super-exponentially suppressed compared to f1(n) and f2(n).
One approach to making sense of (3.23) is to interpret it as a sequence of asymptotic
expansions related to Z3(n)

Z3(n)  S3,1(n)

(3.26)

After subtracting Z3,1(n) we have

Z3(n) - Z3,1(n) n!f2(n)



S3,2(n)

After further subtracting Z3,2(n) we have

Z3(n)

-

Z3,1(n) - n!f3(n)

Z3,2(n)



S3,3(n)

Indeed for any finite m,

(3.27) (3.28)

Z3(n)

-

Z3,1(n) - · · · n!fm+1(n)

-

Z3,m(n)



S3,m+1(n)

(3.29)

25

Z3(n)/n! is not unique in having the asymptotic expansion S3,1(n) : (Z3(n) - Z3;2)/n! has the same expansion, it is tempting to conjecture that the above equations uniquely
determine Z3(n). Thus we present a conjecture. Conjecture. If a function F (n) obeys the properties

F (n)  S3,1(n)

F (n) - Z3,1(n) n!f2(n)



S3,2(n)

F (n) - Z3,1(n) - Z3,2(n) n!f3(n)



S3,3(n)

...

F (n) - Z3,1(n) - · · · - Z3,m(n) n!fm+1(n)



S3,m+1(n)

for all finite m, then F (n) = Z3(n).

(3.30)

4 Higher rank tensors

There exists an enumeration formula for higher rank d tensor model observables in terms of sums of powers of symmetry factors [6]. It is then natural to ask, in full generality, the question of the asymptotic expansion of that counting. At this point, from the asymptotic dominance of small parts, and since one easily realizes that this should hold independently of the rank of the tensor invariant, we conjecture below the series expansion of that counting of rank d tensor.
For rank d tensors, Zd(n) counts the number of rank d tensor invariants. We have in a similar way as above

Zd(n) =



n 2



(Sym p)d-2 = Zd;m(n) + Zd,n(n)

pn

m=1

(4.1)

with,

for

m





n 2

.

For the next developments, we assume for simplicity that n = ml, i.e. that n is a

multiple of m. The generic case should require a bit more work.

We introduce the partial sum, assuming that n and l are large enough,

K
Sd;m;K (n) =

Sym([ml-k, q])

k=0 qmk:q1=q2=···=qm=0
Sd;n;K(n) = Sym([n]) d-2 = nd-2 = Zd,n(n)

(4.2)

By similar techniques previously introduced, we can work out the following expansions:

K
Sd;m;K (n) =

ml-k(l - k)! Sym(q) d-2

k=0 qmk:q1=q2=···=qm=0
= min(K,l) ml-k(l - k)! d-2

as m > 1. Let us restrict to m = 1, and conjecture an asymptotic expansion of that sector (we
conjecture to be the dominant order is given by the fixed order m = 1):

5 Conclusion
We have determined the asymptotic expansion of the counting of rank 3 (unitary) tensor invariants. We have exploited the counting formula in terms of a sum of symmetry factors of partitions. A general principle we have found useful is that these sums of symmetry factors are dominated by partitions with a large multiplicity of a small part. The asymptotic series has been provided and its coefficients determined at all orders : the key results are (2.23)(3.7). As an interesting feature, we express these coefficients as a sum of Stirling numbers of the second kind. We also conjecture similar formulae for the enumeration of any rank d tensor invariants, and expect similar proofs will work. The same general principle allows formulae for sums of symmetry factors of restricted partitions, which we have denoted Z3;m.
It would be interesting to investigate the asymptotics of connected tensor invariants. The connected invariants are obtained from the disconnected ones, Z3(n) (for which we have derived the asymptotics), by taking a plethystic logarithm [6]. The sequence of connected invariants is known to high orders [45]. By inserting the asymptotic expansion of Z3(n) into the plethystic logarithm (PLOG) function, it should be possible to obtain the asymptotic expansion of [45]. Finally, we may ask if the same ideas developed in this work could be applied to the analysis of orthogonal tensor invariants [20]. That series would be slightly different but we expect that the main principle discovered in this work, i.e. partitions with a large multiplicity of a small part will dominate sums over symmetry factors, would apply again in that situation. This deserves to be addressed thoroughly.
It is instructive, in the context of holography and brane physics, to compare the asymptotics of tensor model counting with that of multi-matrix models, and to develop interpretations of the asymptotic results (2.23)(3.7) in these contexts. These asymptotic results have implications for the thermodynamics of quantum mechanical models based on tensor or multi-matrix models respectively. The multi-matrix case has been discussed in the context of AdS5/CFT4 and related gauge theories in [46] and more recently in [47, 48, 49, 50]. The asymptotic counting we have done in this paper holds at large N. We are considering large n invariants when N  n. The super-exponential growth of Z3(n) has the consequence of a vanishing Hagedorn temperature in this large n limit [10]. It will be very interesting to investigate the fate of this Hagedorn behaviour in the

28

finite N tensor systems. The analogous investigation has been investigated for multimatrix models in [47, 50]. The role of tensor models in connection with M5-branes has been discussed in [10]. Beyond the counting of observables it is also interesting to look at the asymptotic behaviour of correlators, for example with motivations from quantum information theoretic aspects of holography [12].

Appendix

A Proof: of Lemma 1
In this appendix, the proof of Lemma 1 is given. It divides into several cases that must be carefully checked.

A.1 Case k even: Proof of Sym[2k/2]  Sym(q), q  k, q1 = 0
We want to prove that Sym[2k/2] > Sym(q), for q  k, with q1 = 0, for k sufficiently large. We proceed by induction on k.

Assume k = 2. It is easy to see that Sym[2k/2]  Sym(q) for q  2, q1 = 0. The condition q1 = 0 means that q = [2], so that Sym(q) = 2 = Sym[22/2]. Let us assume this to be true for all even k up to k, that is

Sym[2k/2]  Sym(q), q  k, q1 = 0 , for k even and k  k

(A.1)

We now prove for k + 2 that Sym[2k/2+1]  Sym(q), q  k + 2, q1 = 0. Consider q  k + 2, we decompose q = [2m, q], with q  k + 2 - 2m, q2 = 0 (no part
of size 2 in q).

Case 0 < m  (k + 2)/2: Then q  k + 2 - 2m = k - 2(m - 1)  k, so as k - 2(m - 1) is even then we write using our induction hypothesis
Sym(q) = Sym[2m, q] = 2mm! Sym(q)  2mm! Sym([2(k-2(m-1))/2])

Sym[2(k+2)/2]

(A.2)

Case m = 0: Let l0 > 2 be the minimum part such that ql0 > 0, thus q = [l0ql0 , q] with q only containing parts of size strictly larger than l0; k + 2 = ll0 lql. Then

lql = k + 2 - l0ql0 < k + 2 - 2ql0 = k - 2(ql0 - 1)  k
l>l0

Then we write using the induction hypothesis on q

(A.6)

Using k + 2  l0ql0 and (k + 2 - 2i)  (l0ql0 - 2i), for all i = 0, ..., ql0 - 1, the proof is completed.

A.2 Case k  11 odd: Proof of Sym[3, 2(k-3)/2]  Sym(q), q  k, q1 = 0
We proceed again by induction on k. Let k = 11, the list of partitions of q  k with parts  2 and their corresponding
Sym(q) are given by

Sym[11] = 11, Sym[9, 2] = 18, Sym[8, 3] = 24, Sym[7, 4] = 28,

Sym[7, 22] = 56, Sym[6, 5] = 30, Sym[6, 3, 2] = 36, Sym[5, 4, 2] = 40,

Sym[5, 32] = 90, Sym[5, 23] = 240, Sym[42, 3] = 96, Sym[4, 3, 22] = 96,

Sym[33, 2] = 324, Sym[3, 24] = 1152 .

(A.7)

30

Hence Sym[3, 2(11-3)/2]  Sym(q), for any other q  k in the above list. Let us assume that the statement is true at order k  k  11

Sym[3, 2(k-3)/2]  Sym(q),

q  k,

q1 = 0 .

(A.8)

Let us prove it at order k + 2. Consider the partition q = [2q2, 3q3, q]  k + 2, where q  k + 2 - 2q2 - 3q3. Either q
is empty in which case k + 2 - 2q2 - 3q3 = 0, or q is a non empty partition with parts of
size 4 or greater, in which case k + 2 - 2q2 - 3q3  4.

Case k + 2 - 2q2 - 3q3 = 0. Then q is an empty partition. Then

k + 2 = 2q2 + 3q3 ,

(A.9)

and we should compare Sym(q) = 2q2q2!3q3q3! (for q3 > 1) and Sym[3, 2(k+2-3)/2]. If k + 2  13, and is odd, then q3 > 1 and should be an odd number. From now, q3  3.
We write the ratio (with k + 2 - 3 = k - 1  10)

Sym[3, 2(k+2-3)/2] Sym(q)

=

3 · 2q2+3(q3-1)/2((2q2 + 3q3 - 3)/2)! 2q2q2!3q3 q3!

=

3 · 2q3+(q3-3)/2(q2 + q3 + (q3 - 3)/2)! 3q3 q2 !q3 !

(A.10)

Assuming q3 = 3, then k + 2 = 2q2 + 9, so k - 7 = 2q2  4, q2  2, such that

Sym[3, 2(k+2-3)/2] Sym[q]

=

3

·

23(q2 + q2!333!

3)!

=

8

·

(q2

+ 3)(q2 9·

+

1)

(A.11)

Note that q2 = 0 would compromise this result. Indeed, this is what is happening for k = 9 such that Sym[33]  Sym[3, 23]. Our condition k  11 ensures that this does not
happen.
Now, assume q3 > 3. As q3 is odd, we must have q3  5, so that (q3 - 3)/2 - 1  0. Then

Checking the exponent, we get for any q  5,

(5q - 11) ln 2 - 2(q - 1) ln 3 = -11 ln 2 + 2 ln 3 + q(5 ln 2 - 2 ln 3)

= (q - 5)(ln 25 - ln 32) + ln 214 - ln 38  0

and this ends the proof of the current case.

Case k + 2 - 2q2 - 3q3  4. In this case, q  k + 2 - 2q2 - 3q3 is non empty.

- Subcase 1: q2 = q3 = 0: Consider the smallest part l0  4, such that ql0 > 0, and

write k + 2 = l0ql0 + q  k + 2 - l0ql0, such

l>l0 lql. that q

 k. Define the smallest

part of q is of size  l0 + 1.

a) If l0 is even, then k + 2 - l0ql0 is odd and  k - 2, and so the induction hypothesis

applies to it.

b) If l0 is odd, l0  5, and ql0 is even, then k + 2 - l0ql0 is odd and  k - 2, we can still apply the induction hypothesis to it.

c) If l0 is odd, l0  5, and ql0  1 is odd, then k + 2 - l0ql0 is even and  k - 2. We

infer that k~ = k + 2

that completes the proof of case c).

(A.15)

- Subcase 2: q2 > 0 or q3 > 0. a) Let us assume that q2 > 0, then we write q = [2q2, q], where q  k + 2 - 2q2 = k + 2 - 2  k. We write q  k - 2(q2 - 1)  k and since k - 2(q2 - 1) is odd, the induction hypothesis applies to q. Then, we obtain
Sym(q) = 2q2q2! Sym[q]  2q2q2! Sym[3, 2(k-2(q2-1)-3)/2]

 2q2q2! 3 · 2(k-2(q2-1)-3)/2((k - 2(q2 - 1) - 3)/2)!

 3 · 2q22(k+2-3)/2-q2 q2! ((k + 2 - 3)/2 - q2)!

(A.16)

that is the expression we sought. b) We now consider the case q3 > 0. If q2 > 0 then we can conclude by the just above
argument. Hence, only the situation (q2 = 0, q3 > 0) remains to be dealt with. Then q = [3q3, q] with q  k + 2 - 3q3  k + 2 - 3  k - 1 and the smallest part in q is of minimal size 4. At this moment, we must study some cases.
b1) If q3 > 0 is even, then q3  2 and q  k+2-3(q3-2)-6 = k-4-3(q3 -2)  k-4. Since k - 4 - 3(q3 - 2) is odd, the induction hypothesis applies to q. We get
Sym(q) = 3q3q3! Sym[q]  3q3q3! Sym[3, 2(k-4-3(q3-2)-3)/2]

(A.17)

where at an intermediate step, we use k + 2  13, k + 1 - 3q3 > 1. Indeed, since k + 2 = 3q3 + |q|, where |q|  4 is the sum of parts of q that is non empty with smallest

33

part at least 4. Then

0 = k + 2 - 3q3 - (|q| - 4) - 4 = k - 2 - 3q3 - (|q| - 4) 3 = k + 1 - 3q3 - (|q| - 4)  k + 1 - 3q3 ,

(A.18)

and since k + 1 - 3q3 is even we have k + 1 - 3q3  4. b2) If q3 > 0 is odd, q3  1, q  k + 2 - 3(q3 - 1) - 3 = k - 1 - 3(q3 - 1)  k - 1.
There are three subcases to be treated. q3 = 1: q  k - 1, with k - 1 even so the induction hypothesis (2.24) applies to q,
and so we write:

Sym(q) = 3 Sym(q)  3 Sym[2(k-1)/2] = 3 Sym[2(k+2-3)/2] = Sym[3, 2(k+2-3)/2] (A.19)

q3 = 3: q  k + 2 - 3  3 = k - 7, with k - 7 even. Thus, the induction (2.24) applies to q:
Sym(q) = 333! Sym(q)  333! Sym(2(k-7)/2) = 333!2(k-7)/2((k - 7)/2)!

B Sage codes for coefficients of the asymptotic series
The coefficients al, l  1 of the series expansion of S3,m;K(n) as n   is given by the following program.
We use the built-in methods - p.centralizer_size() to compute Sym(p) for a given partition p, - Partitions(k, min_part = p).list() that produces the list of partitions of k, each with parts larger or equal q involved in the constrained sum qk:q1=q2=···=qp=0 - and stirling_number2(l,k) to evaluate the Stirling number of second kind with parameter (l, k).

Code for tabulating the minimal value of f (n, k)

In the proof of lemma 2, we use an approximation of kmin the minimum of the function

f (n, k), for k  [K, n]. Here, we show by numerics that, at large and various values of n,

the following approximation of the minimal value of f (n, k) holds:

 kmin = n - n + 1/4

(B.1)

that

for

The function TabMin(nmin , nmax) tabulates the minimal values of f (n, k), for n  [nmin, nmax], and k  [K = n - 13, n]. It outputs 4-tuples
 [n, kmin, n - kmin, n - n + 1/4 - kmin],
