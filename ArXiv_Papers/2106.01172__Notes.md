## Abstract

Excluding 6 outlying stars (e.g., with blending issues) the RRd and Gaia luminosities correlate well. With the adopted temperature zero point from one of the works based on the infrared flux method, we find it necessary to increase the Gaia parallaxes by 0.02 mas to bring the RRd and Gaia luminosities into agreement. This value is consonant with those derived from studies on binary stars in the context of Gaia. We examine also the resulting period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relation in the 2MASS K band as follows from the RRd parameters. This leads to the verification of two independently derived other PLZs. No significant zero point differences are found. Furthermore, the predicted K absolute magnitudes agree within sigma=0.005-0.01mag.
