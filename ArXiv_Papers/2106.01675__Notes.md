## Abstract

We prove asymptotic estimates for the volume of families of Orlicz balls in high dimensions. As an application, we describe a large family of Orlicz balls which verify a famous conjecture of Kannan, Lov{รก}sz and Simonovits about spectral gaps. We also study the asymptotic independence of coordinates on uniform random vectors on Orlicz balls, as well as integrability properties of their linear functionals.
