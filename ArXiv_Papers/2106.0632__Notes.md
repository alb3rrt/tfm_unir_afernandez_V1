## Abstract

Here we study the transport properties of a nickelate compound, namely LaNiO2 using density functional theory (DFT) in conjunction with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). An interacting multi-orbital spin-resolved scenario for LaNiO2 yields a metallic ground state with ferromagnetic correlations. The latter contrasts an antiferromagnetic order reported earlier. The metallic behaviour persists even at large values of the interaction energies. Further support of the metallic state is provided by the angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data.
