## Abstract

The nuclear spin singlet order involving coupled pairs of spins-1/2 may be used to store nuclear spin hyperpolarization in a room temperature liquid for a time much longer than the spin-lattice relaxation time $T_1$. There both are observations of long-lived homonuclear and heteronuclear spin-singlet order. Although hyperpolarized singlet order of the same species are accessible, hyperpolarized heteronuclear spin-singlet order has not been presented yet. Here we show hyperpolarized singlet order is achievable in the sample of $^{13}$C-labeled formic acid solution at room temperature by using optically polarized nitrogen vacancy (NV) center spins in nanodiamonds.
