Abstract
We develop a bottom-up holographic theory of linear meson Regge trajectories that generalizes and unites into one logical framework various approaches proposed in the past and scattered in the literature. The starting point of the theory is a quadratic in fields holographic five-dimensional action in which the Poincar´e invariance along the holographic coordinate is violated in the most general way compatible with the linear Regge behavior of the discrete spectrum in four dimensions. The linearity of radial spectrum ensures the correct structure of OPE of two-point correlation functions. It is further demonstrated how different Soft Wall (SW) like holographic models existing in the literature plus some new ones emerge from our general setup. Various interrelations between the emerging models are studied. These models include the known SW models with different sign in the exponential background, the SW models with certain generalized backgrounds, with modified metrics, and models with the mass term depending on the holographic coordinate in a simple polynomial way. We argue that this dependence allows to describe the effects caused by the main non-local phenomena of strongly coupled 4D gauge theory -- the confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking -- in terms of a local 5D dual field theory in the AdS space. We provide a detailed comparison of our approach with the Light Front holographic QCD, with the spectroscopic predictions of the dual Veneziano like amplitudes, and with the experimental Regge phenomenology. A renormalization recipe is formulated that allows to avoid the problem of unphysical massless pole arising in the vector case in a general situation. The given recipe can be used to predict the intercept of linear radial trajectory related with the ground state mass. We apply our general approach to a holographic study of confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and the pion form factor.

1 Introduction
The modern holographic QCD (AdS/QCD) represents a large set of phenomenological approaches inspired by the gauge/gravity duality in string theory [1­3] and applies the holographic methods developed for conformal field theories to the case of real QCD. The holographic approach is based on a conjecture that observables in strongly coupled gauge theories in the limit of a large number of colors, can be determined from classical fields weakly coupled through gravity in an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space having one extra dimension.
Since the appearance of AdS/QCD approach [4, 5] in 2005, a great number of various bottom-up holographic models for strongly coupled QCD have been proposed and applied to description of the hadron phenomenology. The number of papers on this subject is enormous, among the most recent developments one can mention the construction of various new models partly describing the hadron spectrum [6­16], hadron structure [17­25] including the deep inelastic scattering [16, 26­30], and a very large field of QCD thermodynamics [31­42] in which even some elements of information theory can be exploited (see, e.g., the recent Ref. [43] and references therein). The recent developments also include some applications of bottom-up holographic setup borrowed from the hadron physics to other fields, such as the composite Higgs models [44] and the high-temperature superconductivity [45]. An interesting and quite fruitful branch of the AdS/QCD approach is the Light-Front (LF) holographic QCD [46] in which the holographic correspondence between the fields of a dual 5-dimensional theory and those of the 4-dimensional theory is realized at fixed light-front time. The practical applications show usually that the probe limit (i.e., when the 5D metrics is not back-reacted by fields) is more than enough for phenomenological purposes.
Most of the aforementioned models were built on the base of the so-called Soft Wall (SW) holographic model introduced in Refs. [52,53]. The mass scale c is incorporated into these models via the exponential background ecz2 either in a 5D action of the dual theory [52] or in the 5D metric of AdS5 space [53]. Here z is the fifth coordinate called holographic which is interpreted as the inverse energy scale (related to the quark-antiquark separation in the LF holographic QCD [46]). The original SW model was designed to describe the phenomenology of linear Regge trajectories in the large-Nc limit of QCD [47, 48] but it turned out successful in other areas of hadron phenomenology, in many cases demonstrating an intelligible interpolation between the low and high energy sectors of QCD.
The simplest SW holographic models can be viewed as the most selfconsistent way of rewriting the infinite number of pole terms (expected in
3

the large-Nc limit of QCD [47,48]) with linear spectrum of masses squared, in the pole representation of two-point Correlation Functions (CFs), as some 5D gravitational model of free fields [49, 50]. This means, in particular, that the SW holographic models are closely related with the planar QCD sum rules which were widely used in the past to study the phenomenology of linear radial trajectories in the meson sector [51]. In the field of deep inelastic scattering, the holographic approach, especially the SW one, recovers the old pre-QCD dual description with all its phenomenological successes [17]. But the holographic QCD is much wider in scope -- its strong advantage consists in the use of Lagrangian language that enables more refined calculations and opens the door to many other applications.
At present there is no any systematics in the existing abundance of various SW-like models. The numerous proposed modifications of the SW holographic model are usually aimed at improvement of phenomenological description in some specific problem and the question how a proposed modification will work in other places often remains unaddressed. For instance, many modifications suggested to improve agreement with the experimental spectroscopy in some sector, in reality would lead to inadmissible analytical properties of the corresponding correlation functions, if those functions were calculated. One should not forget that the primary outcome of the holographic approach is given by the CFs which replace observables in the conformal field theories. The mass spectrum represents a by-product. Using the known theorem on the spectral decomposition of the Green functions (the two-point CFs) one can bypass the calculation of a CF by finding the discrete spectrum from the corresponding equation of motion, as is usually implemented in practice. But this should not cancel the importance of respecting the correct analytical properties of underlying CF. The latter becomes especially problematic when non-linear corrections to a Regge like spectrum are introduced, whether manually or via a back-reaction of fields in dynamical AdS/QCD models. We do not know a universal recipe how to do this preserving the analytical properties of two-point CFs. But the things become easier if we restrict ourselves to exactly linear Regge trajectories.
In the present paper, we develop a general theory of bottom-up holographic models describing the linear Regge and radial trajectories. This theory generalizes the SW holographic approach. The starting point of our theory will be the most general quadratic in fields holographic 5D action violating the Poincar´e invariance along the holographic coordinate z but which is compatible with the exactly linear Regge behavior of the mass spectrum. After that we demonstrate how various SW like holographic models existing in the literature plus some new ones emerge from our general setup and study interrelations between the emerging models. We make a detailed comparison
4

of the standard SW holographic approach with the LF holographic QCD, with the spectroscopic predictions of the dual Veneziano like amplitudes, and with the experimental Regge phenomenology. The correct analytical properties of CFs are guaranteed, the only troubling point appears in the case of vector correlation function, where a unphysical massless pole arises in the general case. We construct a renormalization recipe that allows to avoid this problem and even, in a certain variant, to predict the intercept of linear radial trajectory. The absence of massless pole in the original SW model [52] turns out to be a particular case of this recipe which takes place for a particular formulation of the model. We apply our general approach to a holographic study of confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and the pion form factor. We demonstrate, in particular, that the exact vector meson dominance for the pion form factor holds only in the case of the SW model with negative exponential background e-|c|z2, within other formulations, all radially excited states contribute.
The bottom-up holographic theory that we develop in the present paper encompasses and generalizes various ideas proposed in the past and scattered in the literature. Such an extensive analysis is performed for the first time since the appearance of SW models in the pioneering paper [52]. The original SW holographic model of Ref. [52] with the exponential background e-|c|z2 was rapidly followed by numerous extensions, including extensions with opposite sign of exponential background, see the discussions and references in Ref. [54]. It is interesting to remark in this regard that the sign of c in the exponential background was opposite already in the two pioneering papers [52, 53].
An alternative to SW scenario for holographic description of linear Regge trajectories was proposed in Ref. [55]. The idea was to introduce an infrared (IR) correction to the conformal dimension of operators,    + cz2, modeling the anomalous dimension. Using the holographic relation between the 5D mass m5 and , this is tantamount to introducing O(z2) and O(z4) IR modifications of m25 in the holographic action. The O(z4) and O(z2) contributions generate the slope and intercept of linear Regge trajectories, correspondingly. An important advantage was that the given approach could describe the linear Regge trajectories in light baryons, while the usual SW model failed because the background can be factorized from the Dirac equation in the AdS space. A very similar IR modification of m25 arises after a special field redefinition absorbing the SW background ecz2, this was first observed in Ref. [56] and coined the "No-wall" holographic model. Various aspects of interrelation between the SW models with different sign of c in the SW background ecz2 were analyzed in Ref. [57]. The transition from one form to the other was shown to be accompanied by the appearance of z-dependent
5

mass terms. Various effective IR modifications of 5D mass also emerge or are introduced in some other situations (see, e.g., the discussions and references in Ref. [58]), for instance, in describing the higher spin fields in the AdS space [46,59]. Another one predecessor of our present paper is Ref. [60], where it was shown how to introduce an arbitrary intercept in the linear trajectories via a certain generalization of the SW exponential background, the resulting model remains solvable analytically. Finally the present research was triggered by our recent work [6] on a consistent holographic renormalization of two-point correlators that leads to correct low-energy predictions.
The paper is organized as follows. The SW model for arbitrary integer spin is recalled in Section 2. Our holographic theory is introduced in Section 3. In Section 4, we derive a generalized SW background for arbitrary spin. In Section 5, several applications of our approach are considered. The obtained results are used in Section 5.1 for analyzing some confinement properties. The discussions on embedding the effects related with the chiral symmetry breaking are given in Section 5.2. In Section 5.3, we discuss in detail the two-point vector correlator. The pion form factor is studied in Section 5.4. Various technical details are shifted to the Appendices A, B, and C. The experimental phenomenology of linear Regge trajectories is discussed in the Appendix D. The Appendix E is devoted to a brief review of the spectroscopy of Veneziano like dual amplitudes.

Here g = |detgMN | and a normalization constant for the 5D fields VM will be omitted in what follows. The background space represents the Poincar´e patch of the AdS5 space with the metric

z > 0,

(2.2)

where µ = diag(1, -1, -1, -1), R denotes the radius of AdS5 space, and z is the holographic coordinate. According to the standard prescriptions of AdS/CFT correspondence [2, 3] the 5D mass m5 is determined by the behavior of 5D fields near the UV boundary z = 0,

m25R2 = ( - 4),

(2.3)

where  stands for the scaling dimension of a 4D operator O(xµ) dual to the corresponding 5D field (xµ, z). The term "dual" means the relation [2, 3] (exhaustive discussions of this point are contained in Ref. [61]),

(xµ, z)|z0 = zO(xµ).

(2.4)

The spectrum of 4D modes of the model (2.1) is discrete and given by the relation (A.11) of Appendix A for spin J = 0,

m2n = 2|c| 2n + 1 +

4

m25R2

-

c |c|

,

n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

(2.5)

This spectrum has a Regge form due to the dilaton background ecz2 in the 5D action (2.1).
The construction of SW action (2.1) contains an explicit violation of scale and Lorentz invariance along the holographic coordinate z. Anticipating our discussion in the next Section, we notice that the given setup represents only a minimal possibility. Actually if we wish to describe a Regge-like spectrum of the kind (2.5) within an integrable SW holographic model, we may consider the following general ansatz,

1 S=
2

d4x

dz

 g

ecz2

M M  - (m25 + a1z2 + a2z4)2 + bgzzzz

,

(2.6)

where the metric factor gzz originates from the covariant term gMN xM N .

This extension of SW model will be analyzed below for arbitrary integer spin.

We recall briefly how the model (2.1) is generalized to arbitrary 5D tensor fields J =. M1M2...MJ , Mi = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. These fields describe higher spin mesons if the corresponding tensors are symmetric plus some additional

constraints are imposed. By assumption, the given tensor fields are dual to QCD operators OJ =. Oµ1µ2...µJ , µi = 0, 1, 2, 3, near the boundary z = 0. The holographic duality entails the following generalization of the relation (2.4),

J (xµ, z)|z0 = z-J O(xµ), which generalizes the 5D mass (2.3) (see, e.g., Ref [46]),

(2.7)

m25R2 = ( - J)( + J - 4).

(2.8)

It is important to emphasize that the internal self-consistency of the entire approach requires to follow the prescription (2.8) because it guarantees the fulfilment of the duality condition (2.7). The constant part of a 5D mass, consequently, cannot be taken arbitrary. The 5D mass of gauge higher spin

7

fields in the original SW model [52] does not satisfy (2.8) since the condition of generalized gauge invariance in the AdS5 space is incompatible with the prescription (2.8), at least when the dimensions of quark fields or of derivatives of gluon fields contribute to . We will follow (2.8), some additional arguments are given in Ref. [59].
Since a physical hadron has polarization indices along the usual 3+1 physical coordinates, a projection to 4D particle states in holographic QCD is usually achieved via the condition,

z... = 0,

(2.9)

i.e. the physical components are µ1µ2...µJ , all other components vanish identically. A generalization of action (2.1) to the case of arbitrary spin reads

1 S=

d4

x

dz

 g

ecz2

DM J DM J - m25J J

.

(2.10)

Two comments are in order. First, an action for free higher spin fields contains many quadratic terms appearing from many ways of contraction of coordinate indices. But the condition (2.9) greatly simplifies the action leaving only two terms explicitly shown in (2.10) [46,52,59]. Second, the effect of AdS affine connections in the covariant derivatives DM leads just to a constant shift of the mass term. In the presence of z-dependent dilaton background, this shift becomes also z-dependent. In the case of quadratic dilaton of the action (2.10), the shift has a structure m25  c1z2 + c2, where c1 and c2 are certain constants [59]. As the given structure represents a particular case of more general ansatz (2.6) we will consider, the covariant derivatives DM in (2.10) can be replaced by normal derivatives.
The spectrum of the model (2.10) has the Regge form in both the spin J and radial n directions but details of the spectrum depend on additional assumptions [46, 49, 52, 57]. If the 5D higher spin fields are treated as massive ones with masses dictated by (2.8) and imposed constraint (2.9), the spectrum of physical modes is determined from the equation of motion

S = 0,
µ1µ2...µJ while the Euler-Lagrange equations

(2.11)

S = 0,
zM2...MJ

(2.12)

will give the kinematical constraints µµ... = 0 and µµµ3...µJ = 0 eliminating the lower-spin states and thus providing the required 2J + 1 physical

8

degrees of freedom [46, 59]. The further Euler-Lagrange equations will not appear due to the constraint (2.9).
The equation of motion (2.11) together with the condition (2.8) leads to the spectrum (see Appendix A),

m2n,J = 2|c|

c 2n +  - 1 + (J - 1)
|c|

.

(2.13)

For the most interesting case of twist-2 operators1,  = J + 2, we obtain

m2n,J = 2|c|

c 2n + J + 1 + (J - 1)
|c|

,

J > 0.

(2.14)

This spectrum has the string form for c > 0,

m2n,J = 4|c| (n + J ) , and formally does not depend on the spin J for c < 0.

(2.15)

3 "Maximally extended" solvable SW model

Following the discussions of the previous Section, let us add to the SW action (2.10) (with covariant derivatives replaced by the normal ones) the zdependent terms shown for the scalar case in the action (2.6),

(3.1)

To calculate the spectrum and find its parametric dependence it is convenient to eliminate the exponential dilaton factor via the field replacement,

M1...MJ = e-cz2/2M1...MJ . Substituting (3.2) to (3.1) we get

1In the theory of deep inelastic scattering, the twist corresponds to the number of parton constituents inside a hadron. Since a meson consists of a quark-antiquark pair and the higher Fock components are suppressed in the large-Nc limit of QCD [47], the case of twist-2 seems to be the most relevant to the holographic approach.

After obvious redefinitions, the effective 5D mass takes the form

(3.8)

It is seen now that although the original extended SW action (3.1) contained 4 parameters, the spectrum will effectively depend on 2 parameters.

(3.10)

where µ1...µJ denotes the polarization tensor and v(J)(z) is the profile function of physical 4D modes having the mass squared m2 = p2µ. By the standard

substitution,

v(J) =

(3.14)

Using as before the condition (2.8) for the twist-2 dimension  = J + 2, the spectrum simplifies to

m2n,J = 2|c~|

~b 2n + 1 + J +
2|c~|

.

(3.15)

Coming back to our original notations in the action (3.1), the parameters are

~b = a1R2 + (2c - b)(J - 1), c~ = a2R2 + c(c - b).

(3.16)

The spectrum has the Regge form and as it follows from the derivation, the considered ansatz is the most general one among solvable cases leading to exactly linear Regge trajectories. In the literature, one can find some solvable extensions of SW model possessing an arbitrary intercept [6, 55, 60]. The spectrum (3.15) is more general -- the slopes of the radial and spin trajectories can be in arbitrary proportion. This proportion is regulated by the parameter b, i.e., by the term linear in derivative in the action (3.1). In some phenomenological analyses of light meson spectra, these slopes turn out to be different indeed, as in Ref. [62]. Our holographic theory thus can easily accommodate this scenario while for the standard SW holographic models this would be problematic.
The standard SW holographic model is known to work differently for different sign of mass parameter c in the dilaton background ecz2. Various aspects of this difference were discussed in the past [46, 49, 54, 57, 63, 64].

11

A particular manifestation is the mentioned independence of spin in the spectrum (2.14) if c < 0. It is instructive to see how the transition from c > 0 to c < 0 happens within our general case. For the sake of definiteness, imagine that we want to obtain the spectrum of Veneziano dual amplitude (see the relation (E.7) in the Appendix E),

m2n,J = 42 (n + J ) ,

(3.17)

that was reproduced in the first SW holographic model [52]. As follows
from (3.15) and (3.16), in the case of positive sign, c > 0, this spectrum is reproduced if we set a1 = a2 = b = 0, c = 2. In the case of negative dilaton background, c < 0, the solution becomes more complicated: a1 = 0, b = 4c, a2R2 = 4c2, c = -2. The transition from the model with positive sign to the model with negative one can be achieved via the field replacement,

+ M1...MJ

=

e-cz2

- M1...MJ

.

(3.18)

A similar replacement was exploited in Ref. [57]. Our approach yields automatically the form and magnitude of additional terms which arise in the 5D action after such a replacement. It should be also noted that if the higher spin fields are described as pure gauge 5D fields, when the relation (2.8) near the UV boundary is not imposed, the situation is opposite -- the simplest solution, a1 = a2 = b = 0, c = -2, is achieved when c < 0. Exactly this description was exploited in the original paper where the SW holographic model was introduced [52].
Concluding the discussions of this section, it is worth mentioning the first AdS/QCD model where a z-dependent IR modification of 5D mass was proposed [55]. The idea of Ref. [55], in a somewhat reformulated version, was to introduce a z-dependent IR modification for conformal dimension  in the relation (2.8). The suggested ansatz is

   + cz2,

(3.19)

that after substitution to (2.8) results in the following IR modification of 5D

mass,

m25R2  m25R2 + 2J cz2 + c2z4,

(3.20)

where we set  - 2 = J for the twist-two operators. The z-dependent 5D

mass (3.20) is a particular case of our general ansatz (3.8). The Regge spec-

trum of this model follows immediately from (3.15), where we must substitute c~ = c and ~b = 2cJ. For the physical case c > 0 we obtain

m2n,J = 4c

1 n+J +
2

.

(3.21)

12

It was also suggested to replace the total spin J in the Regge spectrum (3.21) by the orbital momentum L of quark-antiquark pair. The resulting spectrum becomes then very similar to the spectra (D.2) or (D.4) in the Appendix D, which were extracted from the experimental data. It is not surprising that the agreement with the data presented in Ref. [55] looked impressive.

4 Relation between the SW background and
z-dependent 5D mass
Our previous analysis demonstrated that a solvable SW model with linear spectrum allows for 5D mass to have two z-dependent contributions as is shown, for example, in the relation (3.8). In the practical situations, the O(z4) contribution can be absorbed by redefinition of the mass parameter in the SW exponential background. The given term contributes to the slope of Regge trajectories. The O(z2) contribution dictates the intercept. This contribution is very important as it determines the mass of the ground state and also may describe the mass shifts caused by the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. A question appears whether an arbitrary intercept parameter can be also parametrized by some correction to the SW background? A solution for such a background was found in Ref. [60]. It was erroneously concluded, however, that this background is not fully equivalent to the O(z2) contribution to 5D mass term and that the equivalence appears in the infrared limit, z  , only . We are going to correct this error and show by an explicit calculation that the two forms of SW model in question are fully equivalent. We will begin with the vector case which was analyzed in the original paper [60]. After that we generalize the result to the tensor case and find the appropriate background for any integer spin.

4.1 A simple vector model
Consider the following problem: How to reproduce the linear Regge spectrum of vector mesons,

m2n = 4c (n + 1 + b) , n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,

(4.1)

with c > 0 and arbitrary intercept parameter b, within a SW holographic model with massless 5D vector field? The solution derived in Ref. [60] reads

where U is the Tricomi confluent hypergeometric function. The case of c < 0 was not considered in Ref. [60] and will be discussed later. Below we give a short proof of the statement that the action (4.2) is fully equivalent to writing a O(bz2) mass term in a theory without the Tricomi function in the background. A more rigorous proof is presented in the Appendix B.
Using the axial gauge (2.9) and omitting the Lorentz indices, the term in (4.2) relevant to the problem under consideration is (we set R = 1)

After the transition to the form of a Schro¨dinger equation, the term with b becomes the constant contribution in the potential (3.13) which arises from the O(bz2) contribution to the effective 5D mass (3.8). This proves our statement.
Consider now the case c < 0. Repeating the derivation above it is seen that for arbitrary sign of c the equation (4.8) is replaced by

For c < 0, the Kummer's equation (4.9) can also be used if we replace x by (-x). The solution formally becomes

c < 0 :  = U (-b, 0, -|c|z2).

(4.12)

The Tricomi function U (b, k, x), however, is complex for integer k when its argument is negative, x < 0. The real-valued solution formally is  = M (-b, 0, -|c|z2), where M denotes the Kummer function, the second solution of Kummer's equation (see the Appendix C). But the function M (b, k, x) is not defined when k an integer less than 1, thus it is also problematic in our case k = 0. A well defined solution is given by (see the Appendix C)

 = |c|z2M (1 - b, 2, -|c|z2).

(4.13)

Unfortunately, this solution is not acceptable for our purpose: since

M (b, k, x)|x0 = 1 + O(x),

(4.14)

we do not obtain the condition (0)  1 in the action (4.2) (where  = U ). The given restriction provides the necessary asymptotics of AdS5 space near the boundary. In addition, the infrared asymptotics of the function (4.13),

z  e-|c|z2 z-2b,

(4.15)

would forbid the positive exponent in the background of action (4.2): As the background is proportional to e-cz22, we would obtain e-|c|z2 at c < 0 and
large z. We thus arrive at the conclusion that the case c < 0 does not work
in the given situation.

15

One may try to cope with the complexity of solution (4.12) replacing the factor U 2 in the background of action (4.2) by U U  and writing a model for
charged vector fields, this would replace the term (4.3) by

But one can show that such a formulation does not work as well.

4.2 Generalized SW model for tensor fields

Now we are ready to derive a generalization of background in the SW action (B.1) to the case of arbitrary integer spin. Consider a free action for massless tensor field in flat 5D space,

where f (z) is Following [60]

and metrics that are used to contract indices. The constant mass term can

be easily added at the end and will not change the result. In order to get the

AdS rules for contraction of Lorentz indices we must impose the following

UV asymptotics,

f (z)  z(2J-3)/2. z0

(4.18)

With this asymptotics, the action (4.17) can be formally written in the form of action (3.1).
With the condition (2.9), the dynamical equation of motion reads

f 2(z)µµ - z f 2(z)z µ1...µJ = 0,

(4.19)

where the indices are contracted using the flat metric

MN  diag{1, -1, -1, -1, -1}.

(4.20)

Using the notations (3.10), the equation takes the following form,

f 2m2 + z f 2z v(J) = 0.

After the substitution

v (J )

(4.23)

We wish to obtain the Regge spectrum of massless tensor fields in AdS5 space in the form of (A.11) (for m5 = 0) but now shifted by the intercept parameter b, n  n + b, i.e.

m2n = 2|c|

According to Appendix A, the potential then must be

z2f = c2z2 + 2c(J - 1) + (J - 2)2 - 1/4 + 4b|c|.

(4.25)

This second-order differential equation for f (z) has two linearly independent solutions in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions. As is well known from the theory of such equations, a linear combination of these solutions can be chosen in such a way that one of them is exponentially decreasing in the (z  ) asymptotics, the second one will be exponentially growing. Imposing the normalization condition (to preserve the standard normalization factor in the action (4.17))

f 2(z)z3-2J = 1, z0
these solutions can be written as follows,

where U is the Tricomi function and M is the Kummer function (which

of argument of associated Laguerre polynomials which appear as eigenfunc-

tions of normalizable solutions, see Eq. (A.9), using the relation: Lkb (x) =

There are various subtle points with the solution of equation (4.25) be-
cause of which the results obtained from popular software systems like Math-
ematica should be used with care. Ignoring this can lead to (partly) incorrect
statements which can be met in some papers. In the Appendix C, we find
the solutions (4.27) and (4.28) analytically and discuss the arising subtleties.
Now we should interpret (4.27) and (4.28) as generalization of SW model with positive and negative dilaton background, SW± for brevity. The standard SW± model must appear at zero intercept parameter b = 0. Since
U (0, , x) = M (0, , x) = 1 for any , it looks natural to choose c < 0 in the first solution (4.27) and interpret it as an extension of SW- model. After that we cannot set c < 0 in the second solution (4.28) because M (, , x) = ex, hence, we would obtain the same SW- background. Thus we must choose
c > 0 in (4.28). The solutions

(4.29)

f2(z) = e|c|z2/2z(2J-3)/2M -b, J - 1, -|c|z2 ,

(4.30)

would define then the backgrounds f12(z) and f12(z) of generalized SW- and SW+ models, correspondingly. However, the Kummer function M (b, , x) is

not a solution (is not defined as some entire function of x) if  is an integer less than 1. This excludes the cases J = 0 and J = 1. To include the scalar and vector cases we can use a linearly independent solution or define a certain

linear combination of them called Tricomi function U (see the Appendix C). That was the reason for writing the first solution (4.27) in terms of U , in this form it suits for any spin. The function U (b, , x) is formally undefined for

integer  but can be analytically extended to any integer  by continuity. This extension, however, results in complex values at x < 0, so we cannot use it in the second solution (4.28). It should be mentioned also that if we wrote

M instead of U in (4.27) and chose the same sign of c in both solutions, then
the solutions (4.27) and (4.28) would not be independent, they were related in this case via the Kummer's transformation M (b, , x) = exM (-b, , -x).

Further we notice that at c < 0 the mass spectrum (4.24) does not depend on spin for tensor mesons. The choice of c < 0 for J > 1 is thus unphysical in our approach. Combining this observation with the discussion above, we

arrive at the conclusion that a self-consistent extension of the exponential
background of the SW model that produces an arbitrary intercept b exists only in the following cases: For SW- if J = 0, 1 and for SW+ if J > 1. The

18

corresponding SW backgrounds are f -(z) = f12(z) and f +(z) = f22(z), where f1(z) and f2(z) are given by the relations (4.29) and (4.30).

The generalized background with the Kummer function can be rewritten

as the standard SW background following the same steps as in the previ-

ous section for the vector case, this also results in the appearance of O(z2)

contribution to the 5D mass.

It is not difficult to show that the inclusion of constant mass does not

change the result. Indeed, in the axial gauge (2.9), the action (4.17) becomes

5 Some applications

5.1 Warped metrics and confining behavior

Consider again the action for a 5D spin-J field J

1 S=
2

d4x

 dz g

B(z

)

DM J DM J

- m25J J

,

(5.1)

with the metrics (see (2.2))

R2 gMN = z2 MN ,

(5.2)

and some z-dependent background B(z). It is straightforward to see that this action can be formally rewritten as

1 S=
2

d4x dz g~ DM J DM J - m25B-(3/2-J)-1 J J ,

(5.3)

with the warped metrics

g~MN = B(3/2-J)-1 gMN .

(5.4)

In principle, one may speculate that the action (5.3) defines a holographic model with certain z-dependent mass term (or vice versa one can impose a z-dependence on m25 in (5.1) in such a way that the mass term in (5.3) is constant) and that this model can take the form of action (5.1) if one neglects the affine connections in covariant derivatives.
What can we gain in hiding the z-dependence into the metrics? A real advantage for the phenomenology is not clear. But this form of writing the bottom-up holographic models is known to be useful in discussions of confining aspects [46]. We recall that thegravitational potential energy for a body of mass M is given by V = M g00 in units where c = 1. The confinement behavior can be qualitatively deduced from following a particle in warped AdS space as it goes to the infrared region, i.e. the region of large z, -- in general relativity, this would correspond to falling an object by the effects of gravity. If the potential V has an absolute minimum at some z0 then one may speculate that a particle is confined in a hadron within distances z  z0 [46] (within the light-front approach, the holographic coordinate z is proportional to the interquark distance in a hadron [46]). This heuristic argument can be substantiated by the Sonnenschein condition for Wilson loop-area law for confinement of strings: A background dual to a confining theory should satisfy the condition [65]

z(g00)|z=z0 = 0,

g00|z=z0 = 0,

(5.5)

20

which is nothing but the condition for extremum of the potential V .
Using Eq. (5.4) the time-time component of the warped metric of the SW model with positive and negative dilaton background, SW±, can be written as (we set R2|c| = 1 in what follows)

e±|c|z2 (3/2-J )-1

g~00 =

. |c|z2

(5.6)

In the vector case J = 1, the SW+ model looks confining. The given observation underlies a traditional argument that the SW- model lacks confinement (see [46] for a review). This argument was substantiated by an explicit holographic derivation of linear confining potential via the Wilson loop in Ref. [66] using the warped metrics with positive exponent. Actually the first SW model was introduced in Ref. [53] exactly in this form. We note, however, that the given conclusion formally changes to the opposite one in the tensor case, for spins J > 1 (the exponent in (5.6) changes the sign).
The range of possibilities in confining behavior becomes much wider in the case of generalized SW models introduced in the previous section. The component g00 in (5.6) is then generalized to

g~00 =

e-|c|z2 U 2(b, J - 1, |c|z2) (3/2-J)-1

|c|z2

,

J = 0, 1,

(5.7)

e|c|z2 M 2(-b, J - 1, -|c|z2) (3/2-J)-1

g~00 =

|c|z2

,

J > 1.

(5.8)

The behavior of g~00 at different J and b = 0 can be analyzed graphically on a computer. Our analysis showed that there are only two situations when a minimum appears, both happen for b < 0.
The first situation takes place for the vector J = 1 case, where a local minimum emerges in some range of intercept parameter -1 < b < b0. If we set |c| = 1 then b0  -0.95. When b  -1, the local minimum tends asymptotically to a kind of absolute minimum situated at z0  0 and separated from the global minimum at z   by a finite barrier, see Fig. 1. The exact limit b = -1, however, is very special since formally U (-1, 0, |c|z2) = |c|z2, hence there is no true minimum of function (5.7). In addition, the second condition in (5.5) is not fulfilled. On the other hand, the action (4.31) cannot be extended to b = -1 since one has no AdS5 space in the UV asymptotics (as a consequence of U (b, 0, 0) = 1/(1+b)), hence, the holographic approach is not justified.

21

The second situation arises in the tensor J = 2 case, where there is a
local minimum for -2 < b < -1. But in this case it is separated from the
global minimum at z   by an infinite barrier at some z0. This barrier emerges due to a specific singularity: The Kummer function in (5.8) stays in negative power but this function has a zero at z0, M (-b, 1, -|c|z02) = 0. The root z0 tends to 1/ |c| when b tends to -2, see Fig. 1.

Figure 1: The time-time component of metrics with |c| = 1: (5.7) with J = 1 and

b = -0.99; (5.8) with J = 2 and b = -1.99.

The limit b  -1 in the J = 1 case corresponds to the limit of massless vector particle in the spectrum (A.14). As is clear from the discussion above, we can find this particle only by taking the limit b  -1, not just setting b = -1 (this somewhat resembles the prescription   0 in calculating QFT Green functions) and only in a deep UV region z0  0. The presented construction could thus serve as a basis for a holographic realization of asymptotic freedom of gluons in QCD.
In the limit of b  -2 of the J = 2 case, another singularity gradually appears. In addition, this limit corresponds to the limit of massless spin-2 particle in the spectrum (A.14). For this reason we do not discuss the minima appearing at b < -2, they would be related to unphysical tachyonic states in the spectrum (A.14). In the parametric interval -2 < b < -1, we get a confinement of spin-2 particles with respect to propagation to deep infrared domain.

5.2 Chiral symmetry breaking
The strong interactions reveal two separated mass scales, QCD  0.2 GeV and CSB  1 GeV. The scale QCD is related to confinement while CSB characterizes the spontaneous Chiral Symmetry Breaking (CSB). The linear Regge spectrum also depends on two parameters, the slope and intercept. Experimentally, the meson slope is almost universal in the light quark sector [67­75] while the intercept depends on the spatial parity of radial meson

22

trajectory [72­75], a short review is given in the Appendix D. It is thus natural to assume that the slope is proportional to 2QCD while the intercept is somehow connected to CSB.
A satisfactory description of the CSB within the SW approach and its extensions is an open problem. One can approach this problem by gradually reproducing various effects and features of CSB. The first effect is a generation of almost massless pion. The second effect consists in a large mass splitting between chiral partners. The given two effects must be somehow related. This can be easily tuned in the generalized SW model under consideration. Indeed, consider, e.g., the mass spectrum (4.35) and take c > 0. Since both the vector and scalar quark operators in QCD have minimal dimension  = 3, the relation (2.8) yields m25 = 0 for vectors and m25R2 = -3 for scalars. The spectrum (4.35) then takes the form

J = 1 : m2n = 4c(n + 1 + b),

(5.9)

J = 0 : m2n = 4c(n + 1/2 + b).

(5.10)

One can further assume that due to some mechanism the intercept parameter b is different for mesons possessing negative and positive parity, b- = b+, and that b-  -1/2. We then get approximately massless pion and simultaneously obtain the radial spectrum (5.11) for the -mesons which is often encountered in the literature, see the comments below. If b+  0 we arrive at the well-known pattern of CSB in the meson spectrum (see, e.g., discussions in Refs. [57, 76]). In particular, for isospin-one light non-strange vector and axial-vector mesons this pattern yields the following radial spectrum,

m2(n) = 2m2

1 n+
2

,

m2a1(n) = 2m2 (n + 1) ,

(5.11)

where m is the mass of the ground -meson. For the ground states, n = 0, the mass splitting between the opposite parity vector mesons can be matched

to a prediction of low-energy quark models based on the effective four-fermion

interactions [77] (in the framework of which the concept of spontaneous CSB

first emerged)

m2 = m2a1 - 6Mq2 = 2m2

1 - 6Mq2 2m2

,

(5.12)

where

Mq  - q¯q ,

(5.13)

is the constituent quark mass, Mq  320 MeV. Strictly speaking, Mq  - q¯q /2, where  represents the UV cutoff in a model. If b+  0 then we

23

get

b-



- 3Mq2 m2



1 -.
2

(5.14)

The given numerical agreement substantiates the assumption that the intercept b arises from the spontaneous CSB.
Digressing for a moment, we should mention that the relations (5.11) are

very old and were emerging in various approaches in the past. First they appeared in the extensions of Veneziano dual amplitude for  +    +  scattering to the reactions  + A  B + C, the obtained positions of poles were [78­80]

-trajectory : m2() = 2m2(n + J - 1/2), J = 1, 2, . . . , (5.15)

-trajectory : m2() = 2m2(n + J), J = 0, 1, . . . .

(5.16)

where n = 0, 1, 2 . . . enumerates the daughter Regge trajectories (see the Appendix E). For J = 0 in the spectrum (5.15), one has to substitute J = 1, i.e. the scalar and vector mesons turn out to be degenerate in mass (the given prediction is not unreasonable, see Fig. 6 in the Appendix E). The shift of Regge trajectories corresponding to opposite parities arises from the Adler self-consistency condition [78­80] imposed on the Veneziano amplitude -- the amplitude of  scattering must be zero at zero momentum transfer. This condition incorporates the CSB at the amplitude level and automatically removes degeneracy between the  and a1 spectra. The corresponding ideas are briefly reviewed in the Appendix E.
Also the relations (5.11) were derived in the framework of finite energy QCD sum rules in Ref. [81]. Later it was shown that the vector spectrum (5.11) represents a general result of QCD sum rules when the large-Nc limit is taken and linearity is imposed [76]. The values of intercept b = 0, b = 1/2 and b = 1 turned out to be distinguished by the property that a half of condensates disappears in the OPE of two-point vector correlators. Various aspects of this result were analyzed in Ref. [82, 83]. Remarkably, the -spectrum in (5.11) realizes a minimum of non-perturbative contributions from condensates to the parton model logarithm in the OPE, in this sense, it is maximally dual to the perturbative continuum2 [84]. Recently the spectral relations (5.11) were reported in the extended quark model of Ref. [87]. In

2If the Regge behavior (linearity of masses squared) is not imposed, the parton model logarithm is approximated by an infinite sum of poles in the "best possible way" when these poles are given by zeros of Bessel function J0 [85]. It looks astonishing that this spectrum obtained by Migdal in 1978 from a kind of quark-hadron duality requirement was reproduced by the first Hard Wall holographic models [4, 5], see discussions in Ref. [86].

24

a particular case of n = 0, J = 1, the spectrum (5.11) leads to the famous Weinberg relation [88], m2a1 = 2m2. The given relation expresses the fact of maximal mixing of longitudinal component of axial a1-meson with the pion after CSB, while between the vector and scalar states such a mixing is absent [89, 90].
Returning to our subject matter, the next step should be an explicit incorporation of the aforementioned CSB effect into the holographic SW approach in a form of some dynamical mechanism. An interesting variant for such a mechanism was suggested within the Light-Front (LF) holographic QCD [46]. The LF holographic approach prescribes  = L + 2 for the twist-two QCD operators, where L represents the maximal value of the z component of the quark orbital angular momentum in the LF wave function. Substitution of this prescription into the relation (2.8) yields

LF :

m25R2 = L2 - (J - 2)2.

(5.17)

This prescribes (J - 2)2 + m25R2 = L in the holographic bound state equation (A.11) leading finally to the spectrum

LF :

m2n = 4c

J +L n+
2

.

(5.18)

The spectrum (5.11) follows immediately as a particular case of Eq. (5.18) [46,

57].

In reality, however, the experimental spectrum of light mesons is not

well fitted neither by the standard SW relation (2.15), even in our extended

variant,

Extended SW : m2n = 4c (n + J + b) ,

(5.19)

nor by the LF one3 (5.18). A good fit of data within the linear ansatz for

masses square is given by the relation [74, 75]

Experiment : m2n = a (n + L + b) , a  1.1 GeV2, b  0.6, (5.20)

see the Appendix D for a more detailed discussion. It looks like in Eq. (5.19) we should take the intercept parameter

b = L - J + 1/2.

(5.21)

3When L is interpreted as the orbital momentum of an quark-antiquark system following the standard assignments of Particle Data [91], as in the fit (5.20). We carried out a phenomenological analysis with the aim of testing the relation (5.18), the results of our global fit were unsatisfactory.

25

We do not know how to derive this prescription, but at least a way for further development can be delineated clearly: A SW like holographic model correctly describing the global CSB effect in the meson spectrum should lead to an intercept close to (5.21). For instance, for vector and axial mesons the prescription (5.21) gives b± = ±1/2. It is interesting to note that the generalized SW model with non-zero intercept after matching to the Operator Product Expansion of two-point correlators results in the pattern |b+| = |b-| [60] (but quantitatively one obtains |b±|  1/3 from the phenomenological value of gluon condensate [60]).
Consider a concrete phenomenological example -- the non-strange isosinglet states in the vector and axial-vector channels, the  and f1 mesons (the experimental spectrum of -meson resonances contains some contradictory superfluous states [91], we wish to avoid complications). The Particle Data [91] reports three well-established -mesons: (782), (1420), and (1650). Taking their masses from [91] and ascribing them the radial numbers n = 0, 1, 2, we get the fit (in GeV2): m2(n)  1.1(n + 0.7). The axial sector contains only one well-established state f1(1285) (another one, f1(1420), consists mostly of the strange quarks). Let us use the nonconfirmed states f1(1970) and f1(2230) [91] as a guess. We ascribe them the radial numbers n = 2, 3 (a state corresponding to n = 1 -- the isoscalar partner of a1(1640) [91] -- is not established). This results in the fit: m2f1(n)  1.1(n + 1.5). The slopes in the obtained linear fits agree with (5.20), the magnitudes of intercepts are close to the aforementioned pattern b± = ±1/2.
The CSB is probably responsible for a specific phenomenon which is not reflected in the mass formula (5.20): The ground states in the vector and pseudoscalar channels lie significantly below the corresponding linear radial Regge trajectories. It means that if a radial trajectory is fitted using only the excited states and after that the mass of ground state is predicted, the prediction will appreciably overestimate the real mass (see, e.g., the discussions in Ref. [92] and the Fig. 6 in the Appendix E). It is interesting to remark that in the vector mesons, where there are many data both in the light and heavy quark sectors, this effect is almost independent of quark mass [93, 94]. As a result, the spectrum (5.11) does not give a good fit for the radially excited -mesons -- the ground state must be separated and the intercept should be taken noticeably larger. This is visualized in Fig. 6 of the Appendix E for the case of -mesons. The same can be repeated for pseudogoldstone bosons. For instance, the spectrum

m2(n) = 2m2n,

(5.22)

which would naively follow from the Eq. (5.18), does not fit well the masses of radially excited pions.

26

The ground state n = J = L = 0 in the Eq. (5.18), which is associated with massless pion in the LF holographic QCD, deserves a special comment: The Schro¨dinger equation (A.7) (where s = L in the given case) does not have a discrete spectrum for L = 0 as the potential is not bounded from below. The spectrum (5.18) therefore cannot be extrapolated to the massless case.
As far as we can see, the problem is rooted in the change of constant part of 5D mass when the prescription (5.17) is imposed. This would physically mean that the CSB is a local effect occurring in the deep UV domain. But the effect of spontaneous CSB is known to be essentially non-local. The nonlocal effects are naturally incorporated in our generalized SW model via the effective z-dependent mass (3.8), let us write once more its structure,

m25(z) = A + Bz2 + Cz4.

(5.23)

The constant part A is given by the AdS/CFT prescription (2.8) in the deep UV domain z  0 and should not be changed. At some non-zero distances, certain non-local effects appear which are modeled by the O(z2) term and supposedly related to the spontaneous CSB. At even larger distances, the O(z4) term comes into play and describes confinement (leading to universal linear Regge trajectories). The intercept parameter b in (5.9) and (5.10) originates both from A and B in the effective mass (5.23). An advantage of the proposed generalized SW approach is that we can keep A constant and vary B. We believe that this gives a physically more plausible direction for description of CSB due to incorporated non-locality and, as a consequence, absence of serious problems with having a massless scalar state.
The traditional way for phenomenological description of the CSB in the bottom-up holographic approach is based on condensation of a scalar field which dynamically acquires a z-dependent "vacuum expectation value" in a form of non-normalizable and momentum-independent solution to the scalar equation of motion [4, 5]. The pseudogoldstone mesons are introduced, in essence, in the same way as in the chiral perturbation theory and related effective low-energy models. It is known, however, that this scheme cannot be directly realized in simple SW models [52]. The underlying reason is that one of two solutions to the equation of motion has incompatible divergent behavior and should be discarded4. But this leads to a wrong pattern of CSB (the quark condensate is proportional to the current quark mass). The given problem, in principle, can be avoided in the present holographic setup5. As
4It is interesting to mention a recent solution proposed in Ref. [23] which was based on embedding O(z2) corrections to the 5D masses, the given proposal is in line with our more general approach.
5An alternative solution can consists in the assumption (see Ref. [96]) that if an IR

27

we have demonstrated in our analysis above, the most general and compact (i.e., not including any additional fields) SW model leading to exactly linear spectrum is defined by the z-dependent effective mass (5.23). All other formulations can be regarded as derivatives. If one introduces a 5D scalar field X dual to the quark condensate, nothing precludes to set C = 0 and (but not necessary) B = 0 in (5.23). The description of CSB can be then constructed in the same way as in the Hard Wall holographic model [4, 5] (the GOR relation for pion mass, mass splittings, various decay constants and constants of chiral perturbation theory). In terms of the exponential dilaton background, this would mean the following: A SW model incorporating the field X should have the form

SX =

d4x

dz

 g

ecz2L + MXMX - m2X X2

,

(5.24)

where the Lagrangian density L contains all fields under study and their in-
teractions with X. The effect of confinement described by the background ecz2 and the effect causing the CSB (occurring at substantially smaller dis-
tances) become clearly separated in the first approximation. It is worth mentioning in passing that a similar to (5.24) construction with ecz2 replaced by e and X by ,

S =

d4x

 dz g

eL + MM - m22

,

(5.25)

was often used in the literature to motivate the origin of dilaton background: If  = 2, i.e. m2R2 = -4 in the equation (5.26) for dilaton field , this equation has a solution   z2.
Following the original papers [4, 5], one should consider the equation of
motion for X in the absence of other fields and independent of usual 4D
coordinates (equivalently, 4D momentum q),

- z

z X z3

+ m2X R2X = 0. z5

(5.26)

The scalar quark bilinear operator q¯q in QCD has canonical dimension  = 3, the UV prescription (2.8) dictates m2XR2 = -3 that results in the solution

X = c1z + c2z3.

(5.27)

modification is incorporated into an AdS/QCD model, the corresponding source term, the first term in the Eq. (5.28), may be interpreted as the constituent quark mass which is proportional to the the quark condensate indeed, see the relation (5.13).

28

According to general AdS/CFT rules, the near-boundary solution of the equation of motion for a field O dual to an operator O with dimension
 is given by [95]

O(z,

q)z0

=

z4--J O0 (q)

+

z-J

O 2 -

, 4

(5.28)

where O0 (q) represents the source for O and O is the corresponding condensate (the one-point correlation function). The comparison of prescription (5.28) for  = 3 and J = 0 with the solution (5.27) leads, as usual, to interpretation of c1 as a constant proportional to the current quark mass mq and c2 becomes proportional to the quark condensate q¯q . The further phenomenology can be developed in line with the pioneering papers [4, 5].
We do not pursue further the outlined way for the description of CSB since this standard setup is very limited in scope: It can describe the CSB in the vector and axial channels but the phenomenology shows that the same phenomenon of CSB recurs for higher spin mesons. In the Appendix D, we recall the known observation that not only the  and  mesons but also all mesons belonging to the leading  and  Regge trajectories do not have parity partners. The spontaneous CSB affects the whole Regge trajectory! For instance, it leads to a splitting m2a3 - m23 which is approximately the same as the splitting m2a1 - m2 described in the standard CSB scenario. An extension of the standard scenario to the tensor mesons, however, becomes problematic because this would involve local interactions of the field X with the higher spin fields. But this would lead to a notorious problem with violation of causality, a universally applicable self-consistent theory for locally interacting tensor fields is not known.
Within our phenomenological approach, we can avoid this problem by simply postulating an effective infrared O(bz2) contribution to the 5D mass. The most economical possibility is to take a universal intercept parameter for all mesons with equal parity, i.e. to introduce two new parameters, b- and b+ (one of them can be zero). We get then a universal shift of the whole Regge trajectory caused by the CSB. Exactly in this way the CSB affects the spectrum in the Veneziano like dual amplitudes, see the Appendix E.
On the phenomenological level, the O(z2) contribution to the 5D mass can be introduced via the interaction term

Lint  bXn2onM1...M1...,

(5.29)

where Xnon denotes the non-normalizable O(z) solution. Since non-normalizable solutions in the holographic approach correspond to some background, one can speculate that the term (5.29) describes a non-local interaction of

29

tensor fields with a background responsible for the CSB. Choosing a proper normalization of 5D fields, the intercept parameter b becomes a coupling. A simple requirement that this coupling is different for different parities would lead to the scenario discussed above. It should be added finally that the O(z4) contribution to the 5D mass can be introduced along the same line -- in this case, Xnon should correspond to some dimension-two condensate as in the scenario of Ref. [56].

5.3 Two-point vector correlator
The central objects in the holographic approaches based on the AdS/CFT correspondence are correlation functions of various operators. The famous AdS/CFT prescription of Refs. [2, 3] provides a recipe of calculating these functions from a dual gravitational theory. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect is that when the dual higher dimensional theory can be treated semiclassically, i.e. as just a classical field theory in a curved space, the obtained correlation functions correspond to the strong coupling regime of 4D gauge theory due to the strong-weak nature of duality in the gauge/gravity correspondence.
The two-point correlation function of vector currents Jµ is defined in the Euclidean space as

d4xeiqx Jµ(x)J(0) = (qµq - q2gµ)V (Q2), Q2 = -q2. (5.30)

Applying the standard AdS/CFT prescription [2, 3] to the bottom-up holographic models, the vector two-point correlator V (Q2) is determined by the expression [4, 5] (we set to unity the general normalization constant)

V (Q2)

=

- zV (Q2, z) Q2z

.
z0

(5.31)

where V (Q2, z) represents the so-called bulk-to-boundary propagator. Such

propagators are of primary importance in the holographic approaches be-

cause they determine the correlation functions. In the vector case under consideration, the function V (Q2, z) is defined as the solution of equation of

motion for spin-one mesons in the Euclidean domain satisfying the boundary

condition

V (Q2, 0) = 1.

(5.32)

Within the standard SW holographic model with the background ecz2 , the

corresponding solution reads [54]

V (Q2, z) =  1 + Q~2 e-(c+|c|)z2/2U Q~2, 0, |c|z2 ,

(5.33)

30

where the dimensionless momentum,

Q~2 

Q2 ,

4|c|

(5.34)

is introduced for simplicity. Actually after extracting the prefactor e-cz2/2z
the finding of this solution just repeats the finding of generalized background function f1(z) in (4.29) with b replaced by Q~2, i.e., V (Q2, z) can be written from (4.29) by setting J = 1, b = Q~2 and multiplying by that prefactor. The
ensuing vector two-point correlator of the SW model is [54]

2V (Q2)

=

1

+

c |c|

2Q~2

-

1 + Q~2

(5.35)

where  denotes the digamma function that can be represented as a sum of

pole terms,



1 + Q~2



1

= - n=0 Q~2 + n + 1 + const.

(5.36)

The poles

- Q~2 = m2n = n + 1, 4|c|

n = 0, 1, . . . ,

(5.37)

of this function yield the mass spectrum that can be also found by solving the corresponding equation of motion. A convenient visualization of the origin of pole structure is given by the following representation of bulk-to-boundary propagator (5.33) derived in Ref. [98],


V (Q2, z) = 4c2z2e-(c+|c|)z2/2

L1n(|c|z2) .

Q2 + 4|c|(n + 1)

n=0

(5.38)

The poles and residues in (5.38) yield directly the spectrum (A.11) and eigenfunctions (A.12) for J = |s| = 1.
As was emphasized in Ref. [54], the choice of positive dilaton background, c > 0, leads to unphysical massless pole in the vector correlator (5.35), the physical choice is the sign c < 0. This conclusion is in accord with our result found by shifting the intercept parameter b from zero value (assumed by default in the standard SW models) with the help of modification of SW background: The generalized background in SW action (4.31) reducing to the SW- model at b = 0 is well defined for the scalar and vector case only.
On the other hand, we can redefine the SW model introducing the O(c2z4) infrared modification of 5D mass (5.23) instead of the exponential background ecz2. This is equivalent to setting c = 0 but keeping |c| = 0 in all

31

relevant relations including (5.33) as was first shown in Ref. [56]. This is qualitatively clear -- the results cannot depend on the sign of c within such a "No-wall" formulation of the SW model. Below the given formulation will be referred to as SW0 model. The definitions can be briefly summarized as

SW± :

Background e±|c|z2, m25R2 = 0.

(5.39)

SW0 :

Background e0, m25R2 = c2z4.

(5.40)

It is seen that the massless pole remains in the SW0 model and already cannot

be removed. In addition, if we introduce arbitrary intercept parameter b with the help of O(bz2) infrared modification of 5D mass (5.23), the massless pole

emerges even for the negative sign c < 0 [6]. All this looks troublesome as long as the proportionality of two-point function (5.30) to q2 = -Q2 is necessary for gauge invariance. The crux of the problem is that the Q2V (Q2) defines the hadronic vacuum polarization and would enter a dressed photon propagator, making photons massive if it does not vanish at Q2 = 0. Below

we show that in our generalized SW approach, the condition

Q2V (Q2) Q2=0 = 0,

(5.41)

can be used to obtain predictions on possible values of the intercept b. The direct substitution of bulk-to-boundary propagator (5.33) to (5.31)
leads to a UV divergent expression. The divergent constant is usually ignored together with a finite constant in (5.35) because only the pole structure is typically of interest. In order to employ the condition (5.41), however, we should use a rigorous holographic renormalization. This renormalization was worked out for the SW model in our work [6]. For the sake of completeness we recall briefly the main idea of holographic renormalization [99].
Within the holographic framework, the two-point correlators are extracted from the (finite) renormalized on-shell action Sren,

Sren [V (q, 0)] = lim Ssub [V (q, ); ] , 0

(5.42)

where Ssub is the subtracted action defined as a sum of the regularized action and counterterms,

Ssub [V (q, ); ] = Sreg [V (q, 0); ] + Sct. [V (q, ); ] .

(5.43)

The procedure of renormalization is performed as follows: To obtain the correlation functions one needs to vary the subtracted action and take the limit of  0 at the end of the computation.

32

In the case of the vector correlation function, the action that is used to obtain it can be written in terms of the bulk-to-boundary propagator as

S

d4q µjµ(q)j(q)

1

z V (Q, z)zv(Q, z)

.
z=

(5.44)

The near-boundary expansion of the bulk-to-boundary propagator, including the divergent terms, takes the form

V (Q, z) = V0 + |c|z2 V2 + V~2 ln(|c|z2) + O(z4).

(5.45)

The coefficients Vi have certain interpretations [99]: V0 has the meaning of the source in the field theory, while V~2 is related to conformal anomaly and can be obtained analyzing the equation of motion near the boundary. The

coefficient V2, on the other hand, can be extracted only from the full solution of the equation of motion in the bulk.

When substituting this expansion back into the action, the following term

arises,

1 z V zV

= 2V0
z=

V2 + V~2 + V~2 ln 2

.

(5.46)

Here we can see the necessary structure of counterterms: They must cancel

the logarithmic divergence near the boundary, i.e., at  0. From this we

get the following counterterm action,

Sct.  d4q µjµ(q)j(q)V0V~2 ln 2 + Const,

(5.47)

where the final constant is defined by a chosen renormalization scheme. One can also add to the counterterm action a finite counterterm. This
freedom represents scheme dependence in the field theory. To understand how we should deal with this freedom let us recall that the subtraction of UV divergent terms in the field theory can be interpreted as a removal of contribution of a region outside the region of applicability of a field theory. This physical interpretation can be applied to the case of bottom-up AdS/QCD models. We can note that the finite contribution from the term V~2 arises from the z  0 region where the entire approach of the holographic QCD models may need adjustments since QCD is not strongly coupled in this UV region. As such, we choose to subtract this finite term as well, which fixes our renormalization scheme. In the end, only the V2 term remains, which is related to bulk dynamics.
We see thus that a careful renormalization fixes the finite constant in (5.35) -- this constant is nothing but Const = 1 - 2 (  0.577 is the Euler's constant) which emerges when taking derivative of propagator (5.33) in (5.31).

33

Only this constant emerges from dynamics in the bulk (the term V2 above) and therefore must be retained near the digamma function; other constants,
both finite and infinite, stem from the UV domain and must be subtracted [6]. The correlator V (Q2) is defined in such a way that the transverse pro-
jector in the polarization operator (5.30) is proportional to Q2 = -q2. This
definition is usually accepted keeping in mind the property (5.41) due to the gauge invariance. Let us "restore" the general factor Q2 and write the explicit
answer for the regularized two-point correlator in the usual SW model,

Q2V (Q2) = |c|

1 + c - 2Q~2  |c|

1 + Q~2

+ 2 - 1

.

(5.48)

It should be emphasized that following the holographic prescriptions one finds an expression for the object "Q2V (Q2)". Now let us extend this expression to an arbitrary intercept. If the intercept is introduced only via the O(bz2)
infrared modification of 5D mass (5.23) (this is equally justified both for c < 0 and c > 0), this is equivalent just to the shift Q~2  Q~2 + b in the
corresponding equation of motion (in our normalization of intercept, i.e. as
in the Eq. (4.35)). The extension of (5.48) reads then as follows

Q2V (Q2) = |c|

1 + c - 2(Q~2 + b)  |c|

1 + Q~2 + b

+ 2 - 1

. (5.49)

The poles of this correlator are situated at

- Q~2 = m2n = n + 1 + b, 4|c|

n = 0, 1, . . . ,

(5.50)

The condition (5.41) tells that the r.h.s. of Eq. (5.49) must be zero at Q~2 = 0. We thus obtain the following equation for the intercept b,

c 2b [ (1 + b) + 2 - 1] = 1 + .
|c|

(5.51)

The equation (5.51) has the following numerical solutions satisfying b  -1 (this restriction excludes tachyonic states in the spectrum (5.50)),

SW- : SW0 : SW+ :

b-1 = 0; b-2  0.31. b01  -0.38; b02  0.94. b+1  -0.52; b+2  1.31.

(5.52) (5.53) (5.54)

The solution b-1 corresponds to the known situation of absence of pole at zero momentum in the correlator (5.35). But as we see, a simple extension

34

of the SW model to free intercept in the linear spectrum gives rise to five new possibilities. It turns out that the SW+ and SW0 holographic models can be constructed for vector mesons without unphysical massless pole. This solves, in particular, the longstanding problem of SW+ model formulated in Ref. [54] (and noticed even earlier -- in the pioneering paper [52] where the SW- model was introduced).
A question appears about a possible physical meaning of the second solution in (5.52) -- (5.54). One can interpret the second solution as a prediction of the second radial trajectory with a larger intercept. Such an additional trajectory for vector mesons is well known in the phenomenology -- it corresponds to the D-wave vector resonances [67, 68]. In the light non-strange mesons, the ground states on these trajectories are (1700) for isotriplet and (1670) for isosinglet mesons [91]. Since the spectrum of light mesons reveals the global behavior (5.20), m2n  n + L, the expected difference of intercept between the S-wave and D-wave trajectories is b = 2. The prediction (5.54) of SW+ model, b+  1.83, is close to this expectation. One can further suggest that the deviation of b+ from b is due to a lower value of slope of angular trajectories with respect to the slope of radial trajectories. We get then a holographic prediction of this effect together with its magnitude. The latter is comparable with the fits of light meson spectra performed in Ref. [62] (10% in the SW+ model vs. 20% in [62]).
The solution b+1 is remarkably close to the intercept (5.21) in the vector case (i.e., when J = 1 and L = 0) which is favored by the phenomenology and by other approaches. And it turns out to be fully consistent with the fact that both (5.21) the LF holographic spectrum (5.18) were derived within the framework of SW+ holographic model.
On the other hand, it is well known that the holographic phenomenology of pion form factor, that will be briefly discussed in the next section, requires b  -0.5 and the choice of SW- model in the standard approach. The dependence of successful phenomenological applications on the choice of a form of SW model causes certain uneasiness. It is highly desirable to have a recipe for a consistent transition from one formulation of SW holographic model to another. In principle, one can accept the following viewpoint: Since we are not dealing with a fundamental theory but rather with a phenomenological model that captures the related physics only partly, we do not need to fix our normalization prescription in the same way as in a fundamental theory. Actually we can construct our own prescription and regard this prescription as a part of our model (that is a usual procedure in various effective field
35

models). In this approach, we should replace (5.49) by the expression

Q2V (Q2) = |c|

1 + c - 2(Q~2 + b)  |c|

1 + Q~2 + b

+ Cren(b)

, (5.55)

and impose the condition (5.41) to find the renormalization constant Cren(b). For instance, if we want to have the phenomenologically motivated intercept b = -1/2, the renormalization prescription is obviously

1

Cren

- 2

= -

- 2

-1- . |c|

(5.56)

The choice of sign of c or c = 0 as in (5.52) ­ (5.54) leads to the renormalization prescription for each variant of the SW model. Each prescription will fix the value of V (0) which can be used to find the constant L10 of chiral perturbation theory or it can be used to extract the intercept of radial trajectory from the phenomenological value of this constant, as in the Ref. [6]. The given procedure can be applied to the scalar sector, with L10 replaced by the chiral constant L8.

5.4 Pion form factor

The electromagnetic form factors are important characteristics of stable had-

rons and have been extensively studied experimentally. These quantities en-

code information on the distribution of quarks and gluons within hadrons, the

knowledge of these distributions is crucial for understanding the transition

of QCD from long to short distance scales.

Within the bottom-up holographic approach, a form factor of a state 

is given by a certain overlap integral in the fifth coordinate z with external

probe described by a bulk-to-boundary propagator [97,98,100] (a short review

and many references can be found in a recent Ref. [18]). For instance, if 0(z)
is the holographic wave function of ground scalar state in the standard SW model with background ecz2, the space-like electromagnetic form factors of

this state (i.e., when the corresponding particle is probed by a virtual photon)

is given by [46]



F (Q2) = e

dz z3

ecz2 V

(Q2,

z)20(z),

0

(5.57)

where Q is the Euclidean momentum, the constant e must be chosen such that F (0) = 1 to satisfy the charge conservation in Minkowski space at Q2 = 0 (or,

alternatively, this can be achieved by appropriate normalization of 0(z)), and V (Q2, z) is the vector bulk-to-boundary propagator (5.33). In other

36

words, the form factor in AdS is represented as the overlap in the holographic

coordinate of the normalizable modes dual to the incoming and outgoing

hadrons with weight factor

the non-normalizable mode dual to 1/z3 originates from the contraction

theg

external M M 

source. The 1/z3, where

M is the polarization vector of external photon (with the condition (2.9),

z = 0) and M stems from the Noether scalar current.

The expression for 0(z) follows from the wave function (A.12),

0(z)  e-(c+|c|)z2/2z2+|s|-J ,

(5.58)

with |s| given by (A.13). This function depends on the mass of corresponding mode only via |s|. If the constant part in the effective mass (5.23) is fixed, 0(z) is not changed if we perform a general shift in the spectrum with the help of O(z2) contribution in (5.23). In principle, we can equate the mass of the ground state to zero and try to interpret 0(z) for J = 0 as the holographic wave function of pion. The expression (5.57) has then the interpretation of electromagnetic pion form factor. Substituting (5.33) and (5.58) into (5.57) we get



F (Q2) = e 1 + Q~2

dz z1+2(|s|-J)e-(3|c|+c)z2/2U Q~2, 0, |c|z2 . (5.59)

0

Since |s|  J this expression is convergent for any sign of c. If the pion

corresponded to twist-two QCD operator, we would have |s| = J (see a

comment after Eq. (A.13)). The expression (5.59) can be then integrated

completely for c < 0, i.e. in the case of standard SW- holographic model,

as shown analytically in Ref. [98]. Taking e = 2|c| to provide F (0) = 1 and

introducing the variable

y = |c|z2,

the electromagnetic pion form factor takes the form



F(Q2) =  1 + Q~2

dy e-yU

Q~2, 0, y

1 = 1 + Q~2 ,

0

(5.60)

remarkably reproducing the result of exact Vector Meson Dominance (VMD):

4|c| is the mass of the lightest vector meson in the standard SW model, (see

the

relation

(5.37)

and

we

recall

the

notation

(5.34),

Q~2



Q2 4|c|

).

In the LF holographic approach, one obtains the result (5.60) due to

the imposed condition (5.17) which means |s| = L = 0 for pions. But as

37

we commented in the previous section, there is no solution with discrete

spectrum for L = 0.

Within the standard AdS/QCD approach, we should take  = 3 for the

pion states because it is the canonical dimension of the scalar quark bilinear

operator in QCD. This leads to |s| = 1 for scalars and the result (5.60) does not take place (scales as 1/Q~4 [46, 100]) if we act in a straightforward

manner. This should mean that we do something wrong when associating

0(z) with physical pion. Our error seems to lie in neglecting the fact that the straightforward non-normalizable solution (z) of scalar equation of motion

for  = 3 has the behavior (z)  z near the AdS boundary, this also follows

from the general UV asymptotics (5.28). For this reason, the physical source

for scalar particles, which is finite at the UV boundary, must be associated

with (z)/z as is always accepted in holographic calculations of relevant

scalar correlation functions. But this also imply that the physical pion state

should be associated6 with (z) = 0(z)/z, hence, it is (z) that should

be substituted into (5.57) in place of 0(z). Technically this is tantamount to taking |s| = 0 in (5.58) and the result (5.60) is reproduced.

Perhaps a more physical argument consists in interpreting the pion as

the longitudinal component of the axial-vector field A||(z), as is usual in the chiral effective field theories and in many AdS/QCD models starting from

Refs. [4,5]. Then indeed 0(z)  z2 for the pion as it arises from a component of vector field corresponding to a twist-two QCD operator, A||(z)  z2, but

the pion mass does not follow from an equation of motion for scalar particles.

In the usual descriptions of spontaneous CSB, the fields (z) and A||(z) are mixed, the details of mixing are not important for us since the main property

is the resulting scaling O(z2), all arising factors will be absorbed into the

normalization F(0) = 1.

Another phenomenological difficulty encountered in the LF holographic

approach is that the poles of vector bulk-to-boundary propagator (5.38) (in-

terpreted as "dressed vector current") do not match the LF vector spec-

trum (5.18) for the S-wave mesons, L = 0. The experimental data on F(Q2)

are well described for the vector spectrum with the behavior of radially ex-

cited states [100],

m2(n)  n + 1/2,

(5.61)

as in (5.18) or (5.11). As a result, the vector meson masses must be shifted manually to their physical location to obtain a good agreement with data [46].
Let us demonstrate how one can proceed within the present approach. Introduction of non-zero intercept parameter b in the spectra with the help

6Remotely similar arguments (but leading to a more complex identification of the pion) were used in Ref. [98] for a holographic calculation of the pion form factor.

of O(z2) contribution in (5.23), as was mentioned above, does not change the

holographic pion wave function. In the bulk-to-boundary propagator (5.33), this leads to the shift Q~2  Q~2 + b and one gets (5.49). Consequently,

the expression for the form factor can be readily obtained from (5.60) by

doing the same shift and appropriately choosing the constant e (to provide

F (0) = 1),

F (Q2 )

=

1+b 1 + b + Q~2

4|c|(1+b)

(5.62)

The form factor (5.62) can be compared with existing experimental data on the space-like pion form factor at different choices of parameter b and an optimal fit can be found. The best fit is close to b = -1/2, see Fig. 3 below. Since the radially excited vector spectrum of SW model behaves as

m2(n)  n + 1 + b,

(5.63)

the value of

1 b=- ,
2

(5.64)

for the intercept parameter results in the behavior (5.61). The cases c = 0 but formally |c| = 0 and c > 0 in (5.59) correspond to
the SW0 ("No-wall") and SW+ holographic models. The form factor (5.60) for these models can be compactly written as


F(Q2) = e(k) 1 + Q~2 dy e-(1+k)yU Q~2, 0, y ,

(5.65)

SW+: k = 1;

SW0:

1 k= .

(5.66)

The integral in (5.65) at k = 0 can be solved with the help of the same

trick as was used in Ref. [98] to derive (5.60) and (5.38). The trick consists

in exploiting a known integral representation of the Tricomi function [101] to

rewrite the bulk-to-boundary propagator (5.33) of SW- model (i.e., c < 0)

as

V -(Q~2, y) = y

Substituting this representation into (5.57) for any sign of c and choosing the pion wave function as before, we get

(5.68)

For k = 0 the integral is elementary and one arrives at the known relation (5.60). At k = 0 the emerged integral cannot be solved in terms of elementary functions but can be expressed through the Lerch transcendent function (t, s, ) [101]. Setting e(k) = k + 1 to satisfy F(0) = 1, we obtain the final answer for the normalized pion form factor,

F (Q2 )

(5.69)

An important caveat: The normalization F(0) = 1 is understood as the

limit,

lim F(Q2) = 1,
Q2+0

(5.70)

because if we set Q2 = 0 in (5.69) we would obtain F(0) = 1 + 1/k. This mathematical subtlety of Lerch function  must be taken into account -- we

make use of the physical limit at zero Euclidean momentum.

It is interesting to notice in passing that the appearance of Lerch tran-

scendent function looks intriguing since this function generalizes the polylog-

arithm, Lis(t) = t(t, s, 1), that at positive integer s arises in the calculations of higher-order Feynman diagrams in quantum electrodynamics. Within the

framework of SW holographic models, this function emerges in gravitational

form factors of nucleons [29].

One can write an alternative to (5.69) expression in a form of convergent

for k > 0 series in terms of Euler digamma and Beta functions,

  Q~2 + n + 1 -  (n + 1) - ln(1 + k)

F(Q2) = 1 +

,

(5.71)

The plots for (5.60) and (5.69) are displayed in Fig. 2. It is qualitatively seen that enlarging k we get progressively slower fall-off with Euclidean momentum. This happens due to a contribution of radially excited vector mesons. The given effect can be analytically visualized using the definition of function (t, s, ) [101],

(5.73)

where the n = 0 contribution canceled the term 1/k in (5.69). The obtained representation can be further simplified writing Q~2 = Q~2 + n - n in the
numerator and making use of the summation



kn

(5.74)

that results in the following pole expansion,

F (Q2 )

n=1

k nn 1 + k Q~2 + n .

(5.75)

The obtained relation shows explicitly how the contributions of highly excited

states are damped depending on a model. In the SW+ model, k = 1, the

damping

factor

is

1 2n

.

In the No-Wall model, k =

1 2

,

the

damping

factor

becomes

stronger,

1 3n

.

The

SW-

model,

k

= 0, corresponds

to

the

extreme

case of infinite damping when only the first term survives leading to the well

known result (5.60).

An alternative way to get the results above is to substitute the represen-

tation for the bulk-to-boundary propagator (5.38) to the holographic defini-

tion of pion form factor (5.57) and use the following property of the Laguerre

41

polynomials [101],


dy y e-yL1n(y) = n0.

(5.76)

0

This relation is responsible for the absence of contribution of higher modes, n > 0, in the SW- model, thus realizing the exact VMD. In the case of SW+ and SW0 models, the exponent is replaced by e-(1+k)y that invalidates the
given relation for k = 0. The use of Lerch transcendent function, however,

looks nicer since it directly yields the rate of damping of contribution from
the excited states.
The nonzero intercept parameter b can be simply introduced in the form factor (5.69) via the shift Q~2  Q~2 + b, as before. This changes the normal-

ization factor, e = e(k, b) (that was previously normalized as e = e(k, 0) = 1), the final result is

F(Q2) = e(k, b)

(5.78)

Now one can try to get an optimal fit for b by comparing the relation (5.77) with the experimental data for F(Q2) in the space like region. A couple of examples is displayed in Fig. 3. The mean slope 4|c| of Regge and radial
Regge trajectories in the spectra of light non-strange mesons was fitted in reviews [68, 74], the result was 4|c|  1.1 GeV2 (see a brief review in the
Appendix D). We use everywhere this input value for the slope of meson
trajectories. In the case of SW- model, the best fit is achieved at

b-  -0.51.

(5.79)

This value perfectly matches the expected pattern of CSB in the light meson
spectrum mentioned after Eq. (5.10) and agrees with the previous fit (5.64) for the SW- model. The global fit (5.20) of Regge spectrum in the light
non-strange mesons also resulted in a mean intercept value close to (5.79). It is also interesting to note that the numerical solution b+1 in (5.54) providing a self-consistency of SW+ model practically coincides with (5.79).
In the case of SW+ models, the best fit is achieved at b+  -0.73. For the
best fits, the curves in Fig. 3 lie very close. In order to estimate a variation of b we show in Fig. 3 a curve for the SW+ model that provides the best fit of data in the interval 0.5 Q2 2.5 GeV2. This curve corresponds to b+  -0.77

42























 

Figure 3: The pion form factor (5.62): b = 0 (solid) and b = -1/2 (dashed). The
dotted line depicts the form factor (5.77) for k = 1 and b  -0.7324. Everywhere the scale parameter |c| is fixed from the phenomenological slope 4|c| = 1.1 GeV2 (see the text). The experimental data is taken from: diamonds -- Ref. [103], circles -- Ref. [104], squares -- Ref. [105], triangles -- data compiled in Ref. [106].

(for the SW- model, such a fitting would give b-  -0.58). Unfortunately, with such small intercept the SW+ model predicts the mass of the first -
meson in (5.63) near 0.5 GeV, somewhat away from the experimental value
of 0.77 GeV [91]. We observe thus that the SW- describes both the spectroscopy and pion
form factor with a universal intercept b-  -1/2, while the SW+ is not so successful. The situation with fits in the SW0 model lies in between. Recalling that the SW- model reproduces the exact VMD, we just rediscover
once more an old phenomenological wisdom about the VMD concept.
The physical value of intercept b can be independently estimated from the mean pion charge radius squared. This quantity appears in the small Q2
expansion of the electromagnetic pion form factor [91],

F (Q2 )

=

1

-

1 6

r2

Q2 + O(Q4).

(5.80)

This relation should be matched to the small Q2 expansion of our theoretical prediction (5.77).

43

As a warm-up exercise, let us first match (5.80) to the small Q2 expansion of (5.62). The result can be written immediately,

r2

6

=

.

4|c|(1 + b)

(5.81)

Experimentally r2 = 0.6592 fm2 with a high precision [91]. Using our value 4|c| = 1.1 GeV2 for the slope and the conversion factor 1 fm = (0.197 GeV)-1 we obtain exactly the estimate (5.79). The correct prediction of r2 means the correct prediction of the experimental slope of pion form factor at small Q2. So the overall phenomenological consistency of the SW- model looks
almost perfect. For the small Q2 expansion of the full answer (5.77) one can use an
identity [101]
(t, s, ) = -s(t, s + 1, )
that leads to the following expression for r2 ,

r2

6 =

(5.82)

It should be remarked that the limits k  0 and b  0 are not completely interchangeable in (5.82) . The first limit can be taken using a series representation for the Lerch transcendent function [101],

for s = 1 and s = 2. Making use of this expansion we reproduce both e(0, b) = (1 + b)-1 in (5.62) from (5.78) and (5.81) from (5.82), i.e. the transition to the SW- model is analytically smooth (but this is not the case
for all software systems). Substituting to the Eq. (5.82) the experimental value of r2 and our
phenomenological value for the slope 4|c|, we obtain an equation for the intercept b which can be solved numerically. For the SW+ model, k = 1, the result is b+  -0.64; for the No-Wall model, k = 1/2, we get b0  -0.59, lying as expected between b+ and b- in (5.79). The obtained estimates are
noticeably closer to b = -1/2 than the estimates above based on a global fit to the experimental data on F(Q2).

6 Conclusions
We constructed a general bottom-up holographic theory of linear meson Regge trajectories. This is done for the first time since the appearance of such models in the pioneering paper [52]. Many Soft Wall (SW) like holographic models and their relatives proposed in the literature can be obtained as particular cases within our framework. The theory is based on the most general quadratic in fields action in the AdS5 background in which the Poincar´e invariance along the fifth coordinate is violated in such a way that the mass spectrum of normalizable 4D modes has the Regge form. The form of this action is not unique and we scrutinized various interrelations between different forms. Perhaps the simplest form arises when the action is written in the pure AdS5 space without any z-dependent background (here z is the holographic coordinate). In this case, the 5D mass term contains O(z2) and O(z4) contributions which are responsible for the intercept and slope of linear Regge trajectories, correspondingly. We argued that these contributions describe the effects caused by the most important non-local phenomena of strongly coupled 4D gauge theory -- the confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking -- in terms of a local 5D dual field theory formulated in the AdS5 space. In addition, the most general quadratic in fields holographic action can contain a z-dependent contribution of another sort, namely which is linear in derivative z of a field. This contribution regulates the ratio of slopes of radial and angular trajectories and, to the best of our knowledge, was never explored before.
We performed a detailed comparison of the proposed holographic theory with some other approaches describing the linear Regge trajectories -- the Light Front holographic QCD, Veneziano like dual amplitudes, and string like phenomenological spectra.
We considered several application of the constructed holographic theory. The first application was a study of confining behavior using a certain formulation of holographic Wilson criterion. It was found that this criterion can be satisfied for the spin-one and spin-two particles. These two cases have interesting massless limits.
As the second application, some effects of chiral symmetry breaking in the meson spectra were discussed. We drew attention to the fact that this phenomenon seems to affect the whole leading trajectories, not just the low-spin states as in the standard descriptions. A possible direction for a holographic modeling of this phenomenon was outlined.
The third considered application concerned the vector two-point correlator. This correlator has a notorious problem of unphysical massless pole which is absent only in the special case of simple SW holographic model
45

with negative exponential background that was introduced in the original paper [52]. We constructed a general recipe how to avoid this problem if a different form or an extended version of SW model is used. Actually we elaborated two recipes. The first one is based on the rigorous holographic renormalization. In this case, the requirement of absence of massless pole is converted into a prediction of intercept of the radial Regge trajectory. The prediction turns out to be different for different forms of SW model. Within the second recipe, the renormalization prescription is a part of a model and is fixed by initial choice of the intercept.
The fourth application was devoted to the electromagnetic form factor of charged pion. We highlighted differences between the results produced by various forms of holographic SW models. Most notably, the exact vector meson dominance takes place only in the case of the SW model with negative exponential background, within the framework of other formulations, all radially excited states contribute. We derived a model-dependent damping rate of the contribution of radial excitations.
Let us outline other possible applications and developments. Following the calculation of Ref. [66], the results of Section 5.1 (where consistent corrections to the AdS metrics within the constructed general theory were discussed) can be used to extract the precise forms of heavy-quark potentials. Also the models in this form can be explored for analysis of holographic thermodynamics. Our general discussion of holographic modeling of chiral symmetry breaking should be further elaborated and concrete models should be constructed. Concerning the hadron structure, many problems can be addressed -- the anomalous form factor of neutral pion, the electromagnetic and gravitational nucleon form factors together with related problems of various generalized quark and gluon distributions and with electroproduction of heavy vector mesons.
Finally we should mention that the linearity of radial Regge trajectories guarantees the expected analytical form of Operator Product Expansion (the parton logarithm plus polynomial in inverse Euclidean momentum squared corrections) of two-point correlation functions. The required analytical properties of correlators are spoiled immediately if nonlinear corrections are introduced, both manually and via a back-reacted geometry. Whether the proposed theory can be extended to non-linear case in a self-consistent way is an open problem.

(A.12)

where

|s| = (J - 2)2 + m25,

(A.13)

and m25 is given by the relation (2.8), m25 = ( - J)( + J - 4). In the case of dimensions of twist-two operators,  = J + 2, we obtain |s| = J.
The incorporation of non-zero intercept normalized as in the text (e.g., as in Eq. (4.35)) is equivalent to adding the constant 4b|c| to the potential of Schro¨dinger equation (A.6). This does not change the eigenfunction (A.12). For |s| = J the spectrum (A.11) becomes

Appendix B

In this Appendix, we provide a more rigorous version of the analysis of Section 4.1 and extend this analysis to the tensor case using the generalized background derived in Section 4.2.
Consider the following 5D action,

1 S=
2

d5xge-cz2U 2(b, 0, cz2)gMRgNSM VN RVS,

(B.1)

where U is the Tricomi confluent hypergeometric function and a general normalization factor is omitted. Actually the antisymmetric tensor field was discussed in [60] but the SW model in the form written in (B.1) is more convenient for further generalization to symmetric tensor fields and to scalar fields. The result does not depend on the chosen form, but for completeness below we will repeat our analysis for the antisymmetric case.

48

Let us eliminate the "generalized" background with the help of appropriate field redefinition,

VM  CvM , C  ecz2/2U -1(b, 0, cz2).

(B.2)

In what follows, we omit the arguments of the Tricomi function, since they are always the same in our consideration. This transformation changes the derivative with respect to the holographic coordinate z,

zVM = czecz2/2U -1vM - ecz2/2U -2U 2czvM + ecz2/2U -1zvM ,

(B.3)

where U denotes the derivative with respect to the third argument. Let us introduce another notation,

U G  1 - 2 cz,
U

(B.4)

which we use to rewrite the field derivative as

zVM  CzvM + CGvM . Consider in detail the kinetic term,

gMRgNSM VN RVS = gµgNSµVN VS + gzzgNSzVN zVS = C2gµgNSµvN vS + gzzgNS (CzvN + CGvN ) (CzvS + CGvS) = C2gMRgNSM vN RvS + C2gzzgNS 2GvN zvS + G2vN vS . (B.6)

Substituting this expression back into the action, the factor C2 is canceled out,

1 S=

d5xg gMRgNSM vN RvS + gzzgNS 2GvN zvS + G2vN vS . (B.7)

The variation of the action reads

it is easy to arrive at the final version of the equation of motion,

µµ - zz

+ c2z2 + 4cb NSvN = 0.

(B.21)

This equation represents a particular case of Eq. (3.9) with J = 1 and m2effR2 = c2z4 + 4cbz2, the spectrum of discrete normalizable modes is given by (3.15) which for ~b = 4|c~|b under consideration is the spectrum (4.1) that we wanted to obtain. This proves our statement.
The analysis above can be simply extended to the case of antisymmetric tensor field which was used in the generalized SW vector model of Ref. [60]. Consider the 5D action

d5xge-az2U 2(b, 0, az2)gMRgNSFMN FRS,

(B.22)

where FMN = M VN - N VM and we preserve the notations of Ref. [60]. A general normalization factor is omitted. Our goal is to eliminate the generalized SW background by doing a field substitution

VM  CvM , C  eaz2/2U -1(b, 0, az2).

(B.23)

We also define the equivalent of the antisymmetric tensor for the transformed

field vM

(B.24)

The z-derivative acts as (the arguments of the Tricomi function is omitted in what follows)

zVM = azeaz2/2U -1vM - eaz2/2U -2U 2azvM + eaz2/2U -1zvM , (B.25)

where U denotes the derivative with respect to the third argument. For the sake of convenience we repeat the notation,

U G  1 - 2 az,
U

(B.26)

in terms of which the field derivative is

zVM  CzvM + CGvM .

(B.27)

51

The 5D derivative can be written as:

M VN  CM vN + CGvN Mz .

(B.28)

The integrand in the action is

gMRgNSFMN FRS =

= gMRgNSC2 (fMN + GvN Mz - GvM Nz ) (fRS + GvSRz - GvRSz ) =

= gMRgNSC2 [fMN fRS + GfMN (vSRz - vRSz ) + GfRS (vN Mz - vM Nz ) +

+ G2 (vSRz - vRSz ) (vN Mz - vM Nz ) .

(B.29)

The second and the third term in the square brackets are equal since we can

rename contracted indices M  R and N  S,

gMRgNSFMN FRS = gMRgNSC2 [fMN fRS + 2GfMN (vSRz - vRSz ) + + G2 (vSRz - vRSz ) (vN Mz - vM Nz ) .

(B.30)

We can further simplify the second term using the antisymmetry of fMN and renaming indices again (we temporarily omit the 2GC2 factor),

gMRgNSfMN (vSRz - vRSz ) = = gMRgNSfMN vSRz - gNSgMRfNM vSRz = 2gMRgNSfMN vSRz = = 2gMzgNSfMN vS = 2gzzgNSfzN vS. (B.31)
The last term can be rewritten as (now we omit the G2C2 factor)

gMRgNS (vSRz - vRSz ) (vN Mz - vM Nz ) = = gzzgNSvSvN - gzRgNzvRvN - gMzgzSvSvM + gMRgzzvRvM = (B.32) = 2gzzgMN vM vN - 2gMzgNzvM vN .

Combining all this together, we get the following transformation for the integrand

gMRgNSFMN FRS = C2 gMRgNSfMN fRS + 4GgzzgNSfzN vS+ + 2G2gzzgMN vM vN - 2G2gMzgNzvM vN .

(B.33)

Substituting this expression back into the action we see that the factor C2 cancels with the generalized background and we get

1 S=-
4

d5xg gMRgNSfMN fRS + 4GgzzgNSfzN vS+

52

+ 2G2gzzgMN vM vN - 2G2gMzgNzvM vN . (B.34)

Since we use the axial gauge for the field, i.e. vz = 0, the second term in the new action is simplified and the last term is eliminated,

1 S=-
4

d5xg gMRgNSfMN fRS + 4GgzzgNSvSzvN + 2G2gzzgMN vM vN . (B.35)

The variation of the action reads

vS = -

d5xg gMRgNSfMN RvS + GgzzgNSvSzvN + + GgzzgNSvSzvN + G2gzzgNSvN vS .

(B.44)

We thus arrived at the equation (B.13). This proves that the considered generalized background is fully equivalent to the infrared O(z2) correction to the 5D mass.
The analysis for symmetric vector case can be generalized to the case of tensor fields. As we discussed in the Section 4.2, for spin J > 1 only the SW+ model can be generalized, and it has the following action,

1 S=
2

d5xge|c|z2M 2(-b, J - 1, -|c|z2)M M1...MJ M M1...MJ . (B.45)

We follow the same procedure as above. First, we introduce a field redefinition to eliminate the generalized background,

M1...MJ  CM1...MJ , C  e-|c|z2/2M -1(-b, J - 1, -|c|z2).

(B.46)

After introducing a familiar notation,

M G  -1 + 2 |c|z,
M

(B.47)

we can write the field z-derivative as

zM1...MJ = CzM1...MJ + CGM1...MJ .

(B.48)

Thus, the action for M1...MJ is

1 S=

d5xg gMN gM1N1 . . . gMJ NJ M M1...MJ N N1...NJ +

gzzgM1N1 . . . gMJ NJ 2GM1...MJ zN1...NJ + G2M1...MJ N1...NJ

. (B.49)

After performing the variation of the action in the same way as in the vector case, substituting various metric-related factors we get

ggMN gM1N1 . . . gMJ NJ = R3-2J MN M1N1 . . . MJ NJ , z3-2J

Kummer's function M (-b, J -1, -|c|z2) is a solution to the differential equa-

tion

|c|z2 M = (J - 1 + |c|z2) M + b

(B.53)

M

M

After the same transformations that we did before when we used this equa-

tion, we arrive at the final version of the equation of motion,

µµ - z3-2J z

z z3-2J

+ 4b|c| - |c|(2 - 2J ) + c2z2 N1...NJ = 0.

(B.54)

This equation represents a particular case of Eq. (3.9) with m2effR2 = c2z4 + |c|z2(4b - 2 + 2J).

Finally we notice that the action used in this procedure is a special case of

a more general action Eq. (4.31), it is straightforward to extend the analysis

above to the scalar J = 0 case replacing (as it is dictated by the results of

Section 4.1) the Kummer's function M by the Tricomi one U .

Appendix C

In this paper, we encounter many times the differential equation

 (y) =

a1 y2

+

b1

+

c1y2

(y),

(C.1)

for various real parameters a1, b1 and c1. This equation looks simple to solve with the help of popular software systems like Mathematica or Maple but for arbitrary parameters the produced results are not always trustful. In order to escape a confusion and better understand what is going on with the solutions at different parameters, below we find the exponentially decreasing and increasing solutions analytically.
In the limit y  , we have the following approximate equation

  c1y2,

(C.2)

which has the approximate solution  = Cesc1y2/2, s = ±1,

(C.3)

55

where C is an arbitrary constant. Since we may be interested both in solutions that are convergent at y   as well as divergent solutions, the sign of the exponent can be either plus or minus. Based on this observation we use the following ansatz,



(y) = esc2y2/2

tj yj+l ,

(C.4)

j=0

 where c2  c1, and s  ±1 depending on the convergence requirements at y  . After substituting into the Eq. (C.1) and simple manipulations we

get


sc2
j=0

2j + 2l + 1 - b1 sc2


tjyj+l + ((j + l)(j + l - 1) - a1) tjyj+l-2 = 0.
j=0
(C.5)

Next, we change the index in the first sum j  j - 2 to get the same power

of y in both sums


sc2
j=2

2(j - 2) + 2l + 1 - b1 sc2

tj-2yj+l-2+


+ ((j + l)(j + l - 1) - a1) tjyj+l-2 = 0.
j=0

(C.6)

Then we extract first two terms from the second sum to get the same starting index as in the first sum


sc2
j=2

2(j - 2) + 2l + 1 - b1 sc2

tj-2yj+l-2+

+ (l(l - 1) - a1) t0yl-2 + (l(l + 1) - a1) t1yl-1+

+ ((j + l)(j + l - 1) - a1) tjyj+l-2 = 0.
j=2

(C.7)

Since the powers of y are linearly independent, to satisfy the equation we need to make each series coefficient equal to zero. The equality to zero of coefficients of two middle terms results in the following two conditions,

l(l - 1) = a1, t1 = 0.

(C.8) (C.9)

56

In general, we could have resolved the requirement the other way, by setting t0 = 0 and l(l + 1) = a1, but this is equivalent to redefining l to l + 1.
The equation (C.8) is called indicial equation. Since a1 > 0 (otherwise the potential in the Eq. (C.1) is not bounded from below), the two solutions of Eq. (C.8) will have opposite sign. Depending on its roots we can get different linearly independent solutions of the original differential equation (C.1). The most complicated case is when the difference between the roots of the indicial equation is an integer (see also the comments at the end of this section).
The remaining sums in our case provide us with recurrent relation between the series coefficients

(C.11)

Next, we change the indices k  2n - 2 and continue applying the relation up until t0,

where we also set t0 = 1, which is equivalent to dividing an undetermined integration constant by t0. This power series is actually a generalized hypergeometric series, which defines Kummer's function,

M (a, b, z) = 1F1(a, b, z) 



a(n) zn. b(n)n!

n=0

 Thus, the final form of the solution is (we also substitute c2 = c1)

(C.17)

where l is the solution of the indicial equation (C.8). If we are interested in a solution converging at y  0 then we should pick the positive root of the indicial equation; otherwise, we should choose the negative root.
If we want to have a solution that diverges at y   it is enough to set s = +1. However, to get a convergent at infinity solution, besides choosing s = -1 we need to take extra measures, since in principle the sum in (C.15) can be infinite. The recurrent relation on series coefficients (C.11) has the following asymptotics at large k,

tk+2



tk . k

(C.18)

Thus, if the series is infinite we will have a divergent solution. A series can be finite only if the series coefficients are equal to zero starting from some kmax. This can only happen if the numerator of (C.11) is equal to zero. This gives us an equation for kmax and other parameters,

2kmax

+ 2l + 1 -

b1 sc2

=

0.

(C.19)

 After introducing a new parameter kmax = 2n and recalling that c2 = c1,

we get a condition

 b1 = s c1(4n + 2l + 1),

(C.20)

which has to be true in order to have a solution that is convergent at infinity.

58

For the sake of completeness, we should mention that the Kummer function in (C.16) is a solution of Kummer's equation,

d2

d

x dx2

+ (b

-

x) dx

- a

=

0.

(C.21)

The two independent solutions of second order differential equation (C.21) can be written in the form [101]

1 = M (a, b, x), 2 = x1-bM (a + 1 - b, 2 - b, x).

(C.22)

Unfortunately, these solutions are not defined at any real values of parameters: 1 is a solution so long as b is not an integer less than 1 while 2 is a solution so long as b is not an integer greater than 1 [101]. Since in our case b = J - 1 with spin J = 0, 1, 2, . . . , these exceptions become problematic. It is known that one can build a solution defined at any integer b by taking the following linear combinations of 1 and 2,

(1 - b)

(b - 1)

U (a, b, x) = (a + 1 - b) 1 + (a) 2.

(C.23)

The function U is called Tricomi function. This function formally is not defined at integer b but can be analytically continued to any integer b [101]. The Tricomi function (C.23) can be also uniquely determined as the solution of (C.21) satisfying the property [101],

U (a, b, x)  x-a, x  .

(C.24)

In the most of cases, the solutions 1 and U are linearly independent. When they are not, it is known [101] that instead of 1 one can use 2 or


~2 = M (a, b, x) ln x + x1-b tkxk,
k=0

(C.25)

as a second solution. This is a direct consequence of situations when the difference between roots of the indicial equation is an integer.
Thus, the second solution for (y) can be written in terms of the Tricomi function with the same arguments as in (C.17),

Appendix D

The holographic models considered in this work are supposed to describe, in

the first instance, the Regge phenomenology of light mesons in the large-Nc limit and in the chiral limit. For the sake of completeness of our exposition,

we will give a short survey on the linear Regge trajectories in the sector

of light predominantly non-strange mesons (for which the chiral limit is the

most applicable) in which the quark-antiquark component of their Fock state

seems to dominate according to the known data. We should make a caveat

from the very beginning that this issue is rather controversial in the literature.

But we hope that even if some states are identified incorrectly or missed, this

would not change significantly the general picture presented below, thanks

to the statistical reasons.

The spectrum of the mesons under consideration is displayed in Fig. 4,

the relevant details are discussed in Refs. [73­75].

The global spectrum reveals two remarkable features: The clear-cut clus-

tering of resonances near certain almost equidistant values of energies squared

and a specific pattern of parity doubling -- the states lying on the leading

Regge trajectories do not have parity partners while all daughter Regge tra-

jectories are parity doubled. The clustering and parity doubling was also

observed in light baryons, a review of the history of these observations and

of proposed explanations is given in Ref. [107]. The parity doubling of meson

Regge trajectories is geometrically visualized in Fig. 5.

It is well seen, in particular, that the leading  and  Regge trajectories

have

the

intercept

near

J

=

1 2

.

For

instance,

if

we

use

the

masses

of

the

most

reliable states  and 3 [91] on the -trajectory to make the linear fit, we

obtain

M2 J  1.13 GeV2 + 0.52.

(D.1)

The states possessing identical quantum numbers and lying on a (ap-

proximately equidistant) sequence of daughter Regge trajectories form the

"radial" trajectories, they represent direct analogues of the radial excitations

in non-relativistic potential models. The ground states below the CSB scale,

about 1 GeV, lie appreciably below the positions predicted by the radial

trajectories. A couple of examples is shown in Fig. 6

Taking the experimental masses from the Particle Data [91] one can make

a global fit of the data using the linear Regge ansatz and find the positions

of clusters in Fig. 4. The first such analysis was performed in Ref. [73], the

result was (in GeV2)

Me2xp  1.14(N + 0.54),

The circles stay when the experimental errors are negligible on the plot. The dashed lines denote the positions of mean (mass)2 in each cluster of states. The open strips and circles are used when the dominance of a quarkantiquark component is partly in question [91]. Two states on the top of each tower do not have the parity doublets and form the leading Regge trajectories (see the next plot).

Figure 5: The Regge trajectories of isovector (left) and isoscalar (right) non-
strange mesons. Each trajectory actually consists of two degenerate Regge trajectories corresponding to even and uneven spins. The filled circles (squares) denote the states contained in the Particle Data [91]. The open circles (squares) are the resonances observed in the Crystal Barrel experiment [68] (they are usually cited by the Particle Data in the section "Further States"). The parity doubling of trajectories is visualized via the reflection (the design of the plot is inspired by the MacDowell reflection symmetry of fermion Regge trajectories leading to the parity doubling of the baryon trajectories, the relevant details are contained in Ref. [108]). The dashed line is a phantom image of the absent parity partner for the leading trajectory. The dotted line imitates the distortion caused by the CSB.

where the integer N = 0, 1, 2 enumerates the clusters. One can further add the numerous resonances observed in the Crystal Barrel experiment on the proton-antiproton annihilation in flight in the energy range 1.9­2.4 GeV, from which the spectrum of light non-strange mesons was carefully extracted [67, 68]. The observed resonances populate the last two clusters in Fig. 4 and allow to extend (D.2) to N = 3, 4. It turned out that the adding of many new resonances does not change noticeably the slope and intercept in (D.2) [73]. The averaged slope found in the compilation [68] coincides with the slope in (D.2). It was proposed soon after (independently in Refs. [69,71,74]) that the integer N represents nothing but an analogue of the principle quantum number in the Hydrogen atom,

N = L + n,

(D.3)

where n denotes the radial number and L is the orbital momentum of quarkantiquark pair dictating also its spatial parity, P = (-1)L+1. All meson
states in Fig. 4 can be classified with the help of (L, n) assignment [74, 75]. The resulting fit obtained in Ref. [74] was (in GeV2)

M 2  1.10(L + n + 0.62).

Figure 6: A possible radial spectrum of light non-strange  (circles) and f0
(crosses) mesons according to the Refs. [92, 109]. The horizontal lines are drawn to distinguish better the position of scalar resonances [91].

The slope from the fit (D.4) is used in the present work. Actually a very close slope for the orbital meson trajectory typically emerges in other works, for instance, in the old phenomenological analysis of Ref. [110].
The relations like (D.3) and (D.4) look non-relativistic since the orbital momentum L cannot be separated from the total angular momentum J in a Lorentz-invariant way. It looks thus surprising why these relations work for light mesons which should represent ultrarelativistic systems. It seems that this question is relative to the old question why the constituent quark model works. Actually we still do not know how the strong coupling regime in QCD settles the physical degrees of freedom, they may well to be non-relativistic -- large effective quark and gluon masses are widely used in various phenomenological approaches. In addition, we can always rewrite (D.4) in terms of the total momentum J, the price to pay will be the need to split (D.4) into several relations for different sorts of mesons. For instance, the states lying on the leading Regge trajectory have L = J - 1 within the quark model. In this case, the spectrum (D.4) becomes close to the spectrum (E.1) in the next Appendix.

63

Appendix E

It is interesting to compare the experimentally motivated spectrum (D.4) or (D.2) with the old predictions of dual Veneziano like amplitudes derived in the framework of the Regge theory [80], the relations (5.15) and (5.16) in the main text,

m2() = a(n + J - 1/2), J = 1, 2, . . . ,

(E.1)

m2() = a(n + J), J = 0, 1, . . . .

(E.2)

Such a comparison is relevant to the present work since the spectra like (E.1)

and (E.2) emerge in the SW holographic models.

First of all, we should remind the reader the origin of spectra (E.1)

and (E.2) from the Veneziano like amplitudes. The original Veneziano dual

amplitude for +  + scattering has the following general structure [80],

(1 - (s))(1 - (t))

A(s, t)  B(1 - (s), 1 - (t)) =

.

(2 - (s) - (t))

(E.3)

The given ansatz possesses nice analytical properties dictated by the relativistic Regge theory, in particular, the amplitude has poles at positive integer  = J, where J is interpreted as the spin of a resonance, according to the Regge theory of complex angular momentum.
Consider resonances in the s-channel, where s means the center-of-mass energy squared in a scattering process. The requirement of linearity of Regge trajectories entails the linear relation,

s (s) = .
a

(E.4)

The poles arise at

s = J,
a

J = 1, 2, . . . .

(E.5)

If the first pole at J = 1 corresponds to s = m2 we get the slope a = m2. The analytical properties of the amplitude (E.3) are preserved if we add the

same terms but with shifted ,

(s)  (s) + n, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

(E.6)

The poles of resulting amplitude are then situated at

s = m2(J, n) = m2(J + n),

(E.7)

giving rise to the leading, n = 0, and daughter, n = 1, 2, . . . Regge trajectories. Exactly this spectrum was reproduced in the original SW holographic

64

model [52]. Such a spectrum is typical for various string approaches -- this is not surprising as the Veneziano amplitude gave rise to the whole modern string theory.
The amplitude (E.3), however, has a serious deficiency for the pion physics: A(s, t) = 0 as s, t  0. Indeed, if pions are the Goldstone bosons, they must interact only via derivatives (an important consequence of the Goldstone theorem) which become momenta in the momentum space, so at vanishing momentum the amplitude of  scattering must vanish as well. The given soft pion theorem is known as the "Adler self-consistency condition" [80]. This condition can be satisfied if we replace (E.3) by the following ansatz (the so-called "Lovelace-Shapiro dual amplitude" [80]),

(1 - (s))(1 - (t))

A(s, t) 

,

(1 - (s) - (t))

(E.8)

supplemented by the condition

1s (s) = + ,
2a

(E.9)

and the same for (t). The obtained amplitude incorporates the spontaneous CSB but now does not correspond to any string theory -- embedding the CSB into a string approach still remains an open problem. Repeating the steps above (s = m2 at J = 1, etc.), we arrive at the spectrum

s = m2(J, n) = 2m2(J + n - 1/2),

(E.10)

which is the spectrum (E.1) for a = 2m2 or the spectrum (5.15) in the main text.

As was shown in Ref. [78], the extension of this approach to more general

reactions  + A  B + C leads to the appearance of a quantization condition

for Regge trajectories generalizing the condition (E.9) and this results in

emergence of the pion Regge trajectory with the spectrum (E.2), in which

a = 2m2 (the spectrum (5.16) in the main text).

The discussion above refers to the exact chiral limit, m2 = 0. With non-

zero

pion

mass,

we

should

replace

the

Adler

condition

(0)

=

1 2

in

(E.9)

by

the

condition (m2) =

1 2

,

i.e.

we

need

to

subtract the

contribution

of

pion

mass,





-

, m2 a

in

the

r.h.s.

of

the

condition

(E.9).

This

shifts

the

slope

of all trajectories to a lower value [78­80],

a = 2(m2 - m2).

(E.11)

It should be noticed that the given shift improves the agreement with the mean experimental slope: Setting m = 0.769 GeV (the mass of neutral meson seen in the photoproduction of this resonance and in reactions with

65

pions [91]) and m = 0.14 GeV, we get a = 2m2  1.18 GeV2 in the chiral limit and a = 2(m2 - m2)  1.14 GeV2 in the real world. The latter value coincides with the fit (D.2) and with the mean slope extracted in the compilation [68].
Finally we should emphasize that the spectrum (E.1) and (E.2), despite all its theoretical elegance, does not describe the behavior of experimental spectrum of light mesons, rather it yields a reasonable description only for the states corresponding to n = 0, i.e. belonging to the leading Regge trajectories. This was demonstrated in the phenomenological analysis of Ref. [72]. Actually the need to find a working relation lead to the model (D.4).
