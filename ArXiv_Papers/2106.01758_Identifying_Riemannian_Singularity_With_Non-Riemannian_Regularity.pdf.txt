Admitting non-Riemannian geometries, Double Field Theory extends the notion of spacetime beyond the Riemannian paradigm. We identify a class of singular spacetimes known in General Relativity with regular non-Riemannian geometries. The former divergences merely correspond to coordinate singularities of the generalised metric for the latter. Computed in string frame, they feature an impenetrable non-Riemannian sphere outside of which geodesics are complete with no singular deviation. Approaching the non-Riemannian points, particles freeze and strings become (anti-)chiral.

I. Introduction

Spacetime singularities urge General Relativity (GR)

to evolve. If not in--still elusive--quantum gravity, the

singularities in any Riemannian metric based classical

theories of gravity have several layers: i) curable, coor-

dinate singularity of the metric, ii) genuine, curvature

singularity, and iii) geodesic incompleteness, as featured

prominently in Penrose theorem [1]. Yet, one encounters

an intrinsic ambiguity in choosing a frame [2, 3] when

applying these notions to scalar-tensor theories, e.g. [4],

since Weyl transformations simply do not leave curva-

tures and geodesics invariant.

From a string theory perspective, the Riemannian

metric gµ is only a fraction of the massless sector of closed strings which should further contain a skew-

symmetric B-field and a scalar dilaton . The theory

implies a crucial symmetry, O(D, D) with spacetime di-

mension D, which transforms the trio of {g, B, } into

one e-2d

(1) which served as generalised metric in the O(D, D) manifest formulations of both string worldsheet actions [8­ 15] and target spacetime effective descriptions currently called Double Field Theory (DFT) [16­21]. By taking not {g, B, } but the O(D, D) multiplets themselves as the fundamental variables, DFT opens a new avenue beyond the Riemannian paradigm [22­25]. In this approach, e-2d is an elementary scalar density with a unit diffeomorphic weight, and HAB satisfies its own defining properties,

HAB = HBA ,

the

invariant

metric

which,

with its inverse, lowers and raises the O(D, D) indices,

A, B = 1, 2, . . . , 2D. Remarkably, DFT can be formu-

lated in terms of any generalised metric that satisfies the

defining relations (2), and may have evolved, at least for-

mally, to an alternative `pure gravity' which string the-

ory seems to predict. It is by now fully equipped with

its own Christoffel symbols, scalar/Ricci/Einstein cur-

vatures [26, 27], and Einstein equations coupled to ex-

tra `matter': GAB = 8G TAB [28]. This single expression unifies the equations of motion of the fundamental

variables, {d, HAB}. Besides, as solutions to the condition (2), all possible classical geometries which DFT is

capable of describing have been classified by two non-

negative integers, (n, n¯) [23]. Only the type (0, 0) is

Riemannian, amounting to the well-known parametrisa-

tion (1), while others are non-Riemannian in nature: the

upper left D × D block of the generalised metric is de-

generate with `nullity' n + n¯, and thus does not yield

an invertible Riemannian metric. For a non-Riemannian

geometry to be a consistent string background at the

quantum level, it turns out necessary to put n = n¯ in

the usual critical dimensions, D = 10 or 26 [25]. Non-

relativistic string [29­31], or torsional/stringy Newton­

Cartan gravities of recent interest [32­39] are of the type

(1, 1) [24, 40­46]. The condition n = n¯ further makes

the non-Riemannian geometry compatible with type II

supersymmetric DFT and superstring [41, 47] (c.f. [48]):

for spin group Spin(t, s)×Spin(s, t) with t + s = 10, the

allowed range of n = n¯ is from zero to min(t, s) [23].

Formally, DFT employs a doubled coordinate system,

xA = (x~µ, x ), and subsequently unifies diffeomorphisms

and B-field gauge symmetry. Yet, the geometry is not

truly doubled: half of the coordinate dependency should

be turned off e.g.

by

setting

 x~µ

 0,

up

to

O(D, D)

rotations. This may suggest that half of the doubled

coordinates are actually gauged [49]. By gauging e.g.

x~µ explicitly as DxA = dx~µ - Aµ, dx , it is possible

to define an O(D, D)-symmetric proper length [50] by

means of the corresponding pull-back of the generalised

metric DxADxBHAB, and to further construct `doubled-

yet-gauged' actions for particles [51] and strings [22, 41].

2

When the generalised metric is (0, 0) Riemannian, all the components of the auxiliary gauge connection Aµ appear quadratically in the actions. After integrating them out, one recovers the conventional particle and string actions. On the other hand, when the background is nonRiemannian, n + n¯ components come out linearly to play the role of Lagrange multipliers. Consequently, the particle is frozen with identically vanishing proper velocities over the non-Riemannian (n + n¯)-dimensions. Further, the string becomes chiral over the n-directions and antichiral over the n¯-directions [23], as happens in the (1, 1) non-relativistic string case [29]. This also implies that, at the classical level, chiral strings get frozen too [25].
From the Riemannian perspective, all the nonRiemannian backgrounds are singular geometries, as the would-be Riemannian metric diverges. Contradistinctly, they are well-behaved regular geometries in the doubled framework. This motivates us to revisit known singular Riemannian geometries and examine their nonRiemannian regularity. In this Letter, we report that a class of genuine singularities in GR are indeed regular non-Riemannian geometries of DFT.
II. Main Idea & Results The Riemann-wise singular geometries of our interest assume the following generic form, with xµ = (t, y, xi),

Our non-exhaustive list of examples includes A. D = 2 black hole by Witten [53], B. D = 4 spherical solution by Burgess et al. [54], C. D = 10 black 5-brane by Horowitz and Strominger [55], and D. D = 10 superstring with negative tension by Dabholkar et al. [56]. All of them feature curvature singularities where F vanishes, while Gij , µ,  remain harmlessly regular. We first present our main idea by peeling off the aforementioned three layers of singularity from the `doubled' perspective.
i)) Removing the coordinate singularity from generalised metric through doubled diffeomorphisms.
Substituting (3) into (1) yields the crucial observation that the coordinate singularity is absent in the O(D, D) fundamental variables: no negative power of F appears,

Clearly, at the points where F = 0, the DFT geometry is non-Riemannian, specifically of type (1, 1), as expected from the underlying Minkowskian spin group signature.

The ansatz (3) partially fixes the diffeomorphisms and

the B-field gauge symmetry, by setting gyy = -gtt and Bty = ±1/F which may be pure gauge. That is to say, the coordinate singularity of the generalised metric is

eliminated through `doubled' diffeomorphisms.

ii)) All the O(D, D)-symmetric curvatures are regular.

Once the DFT fundamental variables {HAB, e-2d} are made free of any coordinate singularity, (and twice con-

tinuously differentiable, i.e. class C2), all the O(D, D)-

symmetric curvatures are automatically regular. In

fact, all our examples satisfy the equations of motion

of the NS-NS supergravity, possibly with an O(D, D)-

symmetric "cosmological constant",

This readily implies that the corresponding non-singular

DFT ansatz (4) solves the DFT Einstein equations

GAB + JAB DFT = 0 everywhere even at the nonRiemannian points of F = 0. It also means that all

the O(D, D)-symmetric DFT curvatures are trivially

regular [57]. Similarly, while the conventional dila-

ton  diverges as F  0, the DFT dilaton d remains

finite, c.f. (4), hence so does the O(D, D)-symmetric ver-

sion of Fradkin­Tseytlin term [58] in doubled string ac-

tions [15, 59].

iii)) Geodesics are complete in string frame:

impenetrable non-Riemannian sphere

The fact that the DFT dilaton e-2d carries a nontriv-

ial diffeomorphic weight prevents it from coupling to

the O(D, D)-symmetric doubled-yet-gauged particle and

string actions [22, 41, 51]. This rigidity naturally settles

the issue of the frame ambiguity: upon the Riemannian

background of (1), an O(D, D)-symmetric particle fol-

lows geodesics defined in the string frame [60].

As shown in the four forthcoming examples, both null

and time-like geodesics are complete (at least) in the re-

gion F  0. The non-Riemannian points of F = 0 form

a sphere for D > 2 (or hyperbola for D = 2) inside of

which (F < 0), no time-like nor null geodesics can pene-

trate. Time-like and non-radial null geodesics cannot

even come close to the sphere from outside (F > 0).

Only radial null ones may reach the sphere with iden-

tically vanishing proper velocities. Besides, undoubled

strings, as an alternative probe of the "singular" geome-

tries [61, 62], become (anti-)chiral: with light-cone coor-

dinates we get

y± -y

=
+

y =

t and = +

also ± = y- (or +

y+±=o0n

limit F  0. Thus, the undoubled, or conventional, par-

ticle geodesics and string propagations agree with the

non-Riemannian (freezing/chiral/anti-chiral) behaviors

predicted from the previous doubled-yet-gauged sigma

model approach [22, 23] which relied on the auxiliary

gauge connection as Lagrange multiplier.

ii)) & iii)) again: geodesic deviations are also regular.

In DFT there is no O(D, D)-symmetric completion of

the Riemann curvature [26, 63, 64]. Hence, the crite-

rion of `O(D, D)-symmetric curvature singularity' may

3

appear unbalanced or somewhat unfair compared to GR. With this in mind, we further analyse the geodesic deviation and the `tidal force' therein (again in string frame),

D2 µ d2

= Rµx  x  .

(7)

As the geodesics are complete and smooth for F  0, their deviations µ should be regular. Then, although the
Riemann curvature itself diverges, its contraction with the vanishing velocities Rµx  x  may be finite, thus preventing the physically measurable quantities from be-
ing singular. We verify this for A, B, C. For D, the full contraction Rµx  x  is finite for non-translational deviations.

III. Examples: geodesics and string propagation

We now take a closer look at each example [53­56]

+xµ+x gµ = 0 = -xµ-x gµ .

(9)

Hereafter, E is to be either -1 (time-like) or 0 (null).

A. D = 2 black hole: non-Riemannian hyperbola

The D = 2 geometry `a la Witten [53] is characterised

From

R

,

the

hy-

perbola, y+y- = l2, corresponds to a curvature singu-

larity. We stress that though the H-flux is trivial in two

dimensions, the B-field still plays a crucial role in making

the generalised metric free of coordinate singularity (5).

Since the metric is invariant under scaling, y± = ±y±,

there are two constants of motion for every geodesic,

L = (y-y+ - y+y-)/F , E = y+y-/F .

(10)

Time-like

.

It follows that time-like geodesics starting from the region F > 0 will never reach the non-Riemannian hyperbola. Null ones may approach only at past or future infinity as F = e±L/l2F0, since the most general null geodesics are, from (10) with initial values y0± and F0 at  = 0, either







 y+()  =  l2/y0- + y0+ - l2/y0- eL/l2  , (11)





y-()

y0-



or y+() = y0+, y-() = l2/y0+ + y0- - l2/y0+ e-L/l2 . With these two null geodesics, the only nonvanishing components for the RHS of (7) are either R+-x x  =

-(L/y0-l)2 or R-+x  x  = -(L/y0+l)2 respectively, which are all finite. In fact, the variations of the general solutions (11) by the free parameters, y0±, also lead to finite deviation vectors, µ. We conclude that the space F > 0 is geodesically complete with no singular deviation. We turn to the string dynamics (8), (9) which read

The second relation gives either +y+ = 0 or +y- = 0.

Similar analysis holds for the last relation. We con-

clude that, in any case, one of {y+, y-} is chiral and the

other is anti-chiral on the non-Riemannian hyperbola.

We require 0 < |h|  b, such that the only singular source

in the metric is at r = 0 as limr0 F (r) = 0. The Ricci scalar diverges at r = 0 as R  - (b-b22-h2)r . Neverthe-

less, with non-singular R(0)-2 due to h = 0, the gener-

alised metric HAB, dilaton e-2d = R(r)2 sin , and DFT

curvatures are all finitely regular. The non-Riemannian

The conserved energy E and angular momentum L set

t = EF (r) ,

(13)

In particular, t vanishes on the non-Riemannian sphere. The remaining radial motion is governed by

0 = r2 + V (r) ,

V (r) =

-E

E2F (r)

+

L2

F (r) .

From limr0 V = 0, it follows that r also gets trivial

at r = 0.

In fact, since limr0 V (r) =

b(b- b2-h2)2

2E b- b2-h2

is

positive

for

either

E = -1,

or

E =0

with

L = 0, the corresponding potential is positive close to

r = 0+. Thus, both the time-like and the non-radial

4

null geodesics cannot come close to the sphere from out-

side. Only the radial null ones with E = 0 = L may do,

but it takes infinite affine parameter as the integral of

d = (EF )-1dr diverges logarithmically. These results

can be all attributed to the repulsive gravitational force

around the non-Riemannian sphere, while it is attractive

for large r  R as gtt  -1 + b

1-h2 R

/b2

.

Exclusively for the radial null geodesics with t = EF =

|r|, we also confirm that the deviation (7) is finitely reg-

ular: the only nontrivial components of Rµx x  at

r

take

the

values,

±2E2 (b- b2-h2

,

for

µ, 

being

or

r.

In the limit, r  0 hence F  0, the string dynam-

ics (8), (9) implies, with y± = r ± t,

+y+-y+F (0) = 0 , +y--y-F (0) = 0 ,

+y++y- = 0 ,

(14)

-y+-y- = 0 ,

where F (0) = limr0F (r) =

2 b- b2-h2

is

nonvanishing.

This confirms that one of {y+, y-} is chiral while the

other is anti-chiral on the non-Riemannian sphere.

C. D = 10 black 5-brane

One particular black 5-brane geometry from [55] reads

ds2

=

-dt2+dr2 F (r)

+ r2d23

+ dx 2

,

F = 1-(rc/r)2 = e-2 .

The Ricci scalar diverges both at r = 0 and r = rc as R =

- . 4r4 c r 4 (r 2 -rc2 )

Though the H-flux is trivial, a pure gauge

B-field should be introduced, as prescribed in (3). The

generalised metric (5) is then non-Riemannian regular

on the 3-sphere of the radius r = rc, but still singular at r = 0. We shall see soon that the non-Riemannian sphere

forms the boundary of a geodesically complete space of

F > 0 which excludes the dangerous point r = 0.

The geodesic analysis is similar to example B and reduces to t = EF and r2 + V (r) = 0 with a potential involving non-negative constants, L2 (total angular momentum) and P 2 (extra momentum),

V (r) =

-E

-

E2F (r)

+

L2 r2

+ P2

F (r) .

Since V (rc) = 2(-E + L2/rc2 + P 2)/rc is positive for either E = -1 or E = 0 with L2/rc2 + P 2 = 0, and V (rc) vanishes, the corresponding potential is positive close to r = rc+. Thus, time-like and generic null geodesics cannot reach the non-Riemannian sphere. Only the radial null ones having t = EF = |r| and L2 = 0 = P 2 can do, albeit taking infinite affine parameter with vanishing
proper velocities. Besides, the deviation (7) is regular: the only nontrivial values of Rµx  x  at r = rc are ±2E2/rc2, for µ,  being t or r.
In the limit r  rc hence F  0, the chirality relations
of the previous example (14) still hold after replacing F (0) by F (rc) = 2/rc.

D. D = 10 fundamental string with negative tension The geometry of the fundamental string [56] reads

ds2

dy+dy- F (r)

B(2)

dy+dy- 2F (r)

with harmonic function F

,

and further at r = |Q|1/6 provided that the ten-

sion is negative, Q < 0. The corresponding generalised

metric--identified as a doubled null wave in [66]--is

then non-Riemannian regular at r = |Q|1/6 but still

singular at r = 0. Similarly to the previous example,

the non-Riemannian 7-sphere of radius r = |Q|1/6 forms

the boundary of the geodesically complete space F  0,

which thus excludes the dangerous point r = 0.

The longitudinal isometries give two constants of

motion P± and set y± = P±F which clearly vanish

when F = 0. Moreover, time-like and also non-radial

(L2 > 0) null geodesics are incompatible with F = 0, due

to

the

fact

that

|x |2

= r2 +

L2 r2

=E

- P+P-F

is

non-

negative. Hence P+P-  0 and the acceleration x¨ =

-3|Q|P+P-x/r8 is repulsive. Radial (L2 = 0) null ones

with P+P- < 0 may reach the sphere only to bounce back

within finite affine parameter. On the contrary, null ones with P+P- = 0 have x = 0 and thus r is fixed for ever. In particular, when r = |Q|1/6, from x µ = 0, xµ should be

(trivially) constant. Anyhow, time-like and null geodesics

are all complete. We turn to the deviations of the bounc-

ing null geodesics,

(15)

This expansion around the bouncing at  = 0 comes from F  6(r|Q|-1/6 - 1), and features all possible constants of motion: P±, y0± and a unit vector n^0. Varying each of them, we acquire a deviation vector µ. Contrarily to the previous examples, some of Rµx  x 's exhibit singularities as severe as F -3/2  -3 for  = ±, or F -1  -2
for transverse . Nonetheless, the full expression of the tidal force Rµx  x  is finite, once contracted with the deviation vectors of (15) induced by (P+/P-) = 0 (dilation, µ = x µ), (P+P-) = 0 (so(1, 1) Lorentz), (tn^r0an· sxla=tio0n()s. oT(r8a)nrsolattaitoinoanl),µw'sitahrethjuestexccoenpsttiaonnt.oBf eiyn0±g
longitudinal, their proper length gets singular, and sub-
sequently so does the tidal force acting on them. Lastly,
the string propagation (8) gives

+(F -1-y+) = 0 = -(F -1+y-) ,

(16)

which yields -y+ = F f-(-) and +y- = F f+(+), naturally implying the (anti-)chirality at r = |Q|1/6.
Comments Converted to the Einstein frame, gµE = e4/(2-D)gµ , the D > 2 examples feature more severe curvature singularities and become geodesically incomplete e.g. [67],

5

with singular deviations. D = 2 DFT is essentially Jackiw­Teitelboim gravity [68, 69] as gµJT = e-2gµ. Witten's solution is then mapped to flat spacetime.
Constant non-Riemannian backgrounds were shown in
[45] to admit infinite-dimensional isometries. All of them
might be realised as the asymptotic symmetries of the non-Riemannian spheres with large radius (as F   0).
The associated, infinitely many, conserved charges then
might store all the information of the in-going and freez-
ing null radial geodesics. We call for further studies.
