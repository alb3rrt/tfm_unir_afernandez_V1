THE PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS APPROXIMATION OF THE ANISOTROPIC HORIZONTALLY VISCOUS NAVIER-STOKES
EQUATIONS
JINKAI LI, EDRISS S. TITI, AND GUOZHI YUAN
Abstract. In this paper, we provide rigorous justification of the hydrostatic approximation and the derivation of primitive equations as the small aspect ratio limit of the incompressible three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in the anisotropic horizontal viscosity regime. Setting  > 0 to be the small aspect ratio of the vertical to the horizontal scales of the domain, we investigate the case when the horizontal and vertical viscosities in the incompressible three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are of orders O(1) and O(), respectively, with  > 2, for which the limiting system is the primitive equations with only horizontal viscosity as  tends to zero. In particular we show that for "well prepared" initial data the solutions of the scaled incompressible threedimensional Navier-Stokes equations converge strongly, in any finite interval of time, to the corresponding solutions of the anisotropic primitive equations with only horizontal viscosities, as  tends to zero, and that the convergence

rate is of order O  2 , where  = min{ - 2, 2}. Note that this result is different from the case  = 2 studied in [Li, J.; Titi, E.S.: The primitive equations as the small aspect ratio limit of the Navier-Stokes equations: Rigorous justification of the hydrostatic approximation, J. Math. Pures Appl., 124 (2019), 30­58], where the limiting system is the primitive equations with full viscosities and the convergence is globally in time and its rate of order O ().
1. Introduction
The hydrostatic approximation is a fundamental assumption in the geophysics and a building block in the large scale oceanic and atmospheric dynamics, see [37, 48, 49, 51, 53, 55]. It can be derived by either the scale analysis or taking the small aspect ratio limit to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Thought it is proved to be accurate in the practical applications, the corresponding rigorous mathematical justification has been only given in the case that the horizontal and vertical viscosities have some particular orders of the aspect ratio, see Aze´radGuille´n [1] and Li-Titi [38] in the weak and strong setting, respectively. The aim of the current paper is to investigate the more general case that the horizontal and vertical viscosities are not necessary to be of the particular order. As shown in the below that the limiting system considered in the current paper is anisotropic primitive equations with only horizontal viscosities, while those in [1, 38] have full viscosities.

1.1. Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in thin domains. Given a two dimensional domain M = (0, L1) × (0, L2) with L1, L2 > 0. Let - = M × (-, 0) be a three-dimensional box, where  > 0 is small representing the aspect ratio. Consider the anisotropic incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in -

(1.1)

tu + (u · )u - µH u - z2u + p = 0,  · u = 0,

where the vector field u = (v, w) representing the velocity, with v = (v1, v2), and the scalar function p representing the pressure are the unknowns, µ and  are the horizontal and vertical viscous coefficients, respectively. Assume that µ = O(1) and  = O() for some positive , as   0. The initial-boundary value problem will be studied in this paper and, thus, we complement system (1.1) with the following boundary and initial conditions:

(1.2)

 u and p are periodic in x and y, 
(zv, w)|z=-,0 = (0, 0),  u|t=0 = (v0, w0).

Note that by extending v, w, and p, respectively, evenly, oddly, and evenly in z, one can extend the initial-boundary value problem (1.1)­(1.2) defined in - to the corresponding problem defined in the extended domain  := M × (-, ). The
extended initial-boundary value problem in  := M × (-, ) is as follows

(1.3)

tu + (u · )u - µH u - z2u + p = 0,   · u = 0,  
v, w and p are periodic in x, y and z,
v, w and p be even, odd and even in z,   u|t=0 = (v0, w0).

On the one hand, for any solution (u, p) to (1.1)­(1.2), if extending v, w, and p, respectively, evenly, oddly, and evenly in z, then the extension, denoted by (u~, p~), is a solution to (1.3). In the setting of strong solutions, this can be verified by noticing that extensions as above preserve the Sobolev regularities of v and w due to the boundary conditions in (1.2), while in the setting of weak solutions, this is based on the fact that regular testing functions satisfying the symmetry conditions in (1.3) fulfill the boundary conditions in (1.2) and thus can be chosen as testing functions for (1.1)­(1.2). On the other hand, if (u, p) is a solution to (1.3) in , then the restriction of (u, p) on - is a solution to (1.1)­(1.2). Therefore (1.1)­(1.2) is equivalent to (1.3). Due to this equivalence, one only needs to consider (1.3).
We are interested in the small aspect ratio limit as   0 to the above system. Since only the regime of the primitive equations will be considered in the current paper, we assume that   2. In fact, in the case   (0, 2), one can show in a similar way as in [2] that system (1.3) converges to a limiting system with only vertical dissipation, which is different from the primitive equations.
In order to investigate the small aspect ratio limit, we first carry out some scaling transformation to system (1.3) such that the resulting system is defined on a fixed

HYDROSTATIC APPROXIMATION AND PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS JUSTIFICATION 3

domain independent of . Similar to [38], we define the following new unknowns

v(x, y, z, t) = v(x, y, z, t), p(x, y, z, t) = p(x, y, z, t),

w(x, y, z, t)

=

1 w(x, y, z, t), 

u = (v, w), (x, y, z)  M × (-1, 1).

Then, u and p satisfy the following scaled Navier-Stokes equations

(1.4)

tv + (u · )v - H v - -2z2v + H p = 0, 
 · u = 0,

2(tw + u · w - H w - -2z2w) + zp = 0,

in the fixed domain  := M × (-1, 1), subject to

(1.5) (1.6) (1.7)

v, w and p are periodic in x, y, z, v, w and p are even, odd and even in z, respectively,
(v, w)|t=0 = (v0, w0).

Since system (1.4) preserves the above symmetry, one only needs to impose the required condition on the initial velocity. Due to this, throughout this paper, we always assume that

(1.8)

v0 and w0 are even and odd in z, respectively.

Throughout this paper, we set H and H to denote (x, y) and x2 + y2, respectively. For any 1  q   and positive integer k, we denote by Lq() and Hk(),
respectively, the standard Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces, and we use the notation · q and · q,M to denote the Lq() and Lq(M ) norms, respectively. Since we
consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, we use L2() to denote the space consisting of all divergence-free functions in L2(). It should be emphasized
that all the functions considered in this paper are supposed to be periodic in the
spatial variables. By the classic theory, see, e.g., [12] and [50], for any initial data u0  L2(),
there is a global weak solution u to (1.4), subject to (1.5) and (1.7). Note that if
the initial data u0 satisfies the symmetry condition (1.8), then one can construct, in the same way as in [12] and [50], such weak solutions that satisfy the additional
symmetry condition (1.6). In fact, in this case, the approximate solutions satisfy the
additional symmetry condition (1.6) and, as a result, the weak solutions achieved
as the limits of the approximated solutions also satisfy (1.6). Therefore, for any u0  L2() satisfying the symmetry condition (1.8), there is global weak solution u to system (1.4) subject to (1.5)­(1.7). Here the weak solutions are defined as
follows.

Definition 1.1. Let u0 = (v0, w0)  L2() satisfy the symmetry condition (1.8). u is called a Leray-Hopf weak solution to system (1.4) subject to (1.5)­(1.7), if
(i) u  Cw([0, ); L2())  L2loc([0, ); H1()) is spatially periodic and satisfies the symmetry condition (1.6), where Cw means weakly continuity;

(iii) For any spatially periodic function  = (H , 3)  C0(×[0, )) satisfying  ·  = 0 and the symmetry condition (1.6), where H = (1, 2), the following integral identity holds:

- (v · tH + 2wt3) + (u · )vH + 2u · w3
0
+ H v : H H + -2zv · zH + 2H w · H 3 + zwz3 ddt

= v0 · H (·, 0) + 2w03(·, 0) d,

where d = dxdydz.

1.2. Small aspect ratio limit and the primitive equations (PEs). By taking the formal limit as   0, it is natural to expect that (1.4) converges in some suitable sense to the following limiting systems

(1.9)

tv + (u · )v - v + H p = 0, 
H · v + zw = 0,
zp = 0,

if  = 2 in (1.4), and

(1.10)

tv + (u · )v - H v + H p = 0, 
H · v + zw = 0,
zp = 0,

if  > 2 in (1.4), where the vector field u = (v, w) and the scalar function p are

the velocity and pressure, respectively. Both (1.9) and (1.10) are the simplest form

of the primitive equations (PEs). Note that in the case  = 2 the limiting system

in (1.9) has dissipation in all directions, while in the case  > 2 the corresponding

system in (1.10) has dissipation only in the horizontal directions.

Recalling that we consider the periodic initial-boundary value problem to the

scaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (1.4), it is clear that one should im-

pose the same boundary conditions and symmetry conditions to the corresponding

limiting system (1.10). However, one only needs to impose the initial condition

on the horizontal velocity. In fact, by (1.8), w0 is odd and periodic in z, one

has w0|z=±1 = 0. Then, w0 can be uniquely determined by the incompressibility

condition as

z

(1.11)

w0(x, y, z) = - H · v0(x, y, )d, (x, y, z)  .

-1

We call initial data (v0, w0) satisfying condition (1.11) well prepared initial data. Similarly, w can also be uniquely determined by the incompressibility condition

as (1.12)

z
w(x, y, z, t) = - H · v(x, y, , t)d, (x, y, z)  .
-1

Due to these facts, throughout this paper, concerning the solutions to (1.10), we

only specify the horizontal components v, and w is uniquely determined by (1.12).

The primitive equations, no matter with full or partial dissipation, play funda-

mental roles in the geophysical fluid dynamics and, in particular, in the large scale

oceanic and atmospheric dynamics, one can see the books [25, 37, 48, 49, 51, 53, 55]

HYDROSTATIC APPROXIMATION AND PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS JUSTIFICATION 5
for the applications and backgrounds of the primitive equations. They are the core in the weather prediction models. Due to the presence of strong turbulent mixing in the horizontal direction in the large scale atmosphere, the eddy viscosity in the horizontal direction is much stronger than that in the vertical direction. As a result, both physically and mathematically, it is necessary to investigate the primitive equations with anisotropic viscosities and, in particular, the system that with only horizontal eddy viscosities.
The first systematical studies of the the primitive equation was made by Lions­ Temam­Wang [41, 42, 43] in the 1990s, where they established the global existence of weak solutions to the system that with full viscosities; however, the uniqueness of weak solutions is still unclear, even for the two-dimensional case. By making full use of the hydrostatic balance to exploit the two-dimensional structure of the key part of the pressure and decomposing the velocity into barotropic and baroclinic components, Cao­Titi [9] established the global well-posedness of strong solution to the three dimensional primitive equations, see also Kobelkov [34] and Kukavica­ Ziane [35]. One can see [23, 30, 33, 36, 39] for the global well-posed results with weaker initial data, and see [40] for the results taking the topography effects into considerations. The global well-posedness results in [9, 34, 35] are established in the L2 type spaces, for the corresponding results in the Lp type spaces based on the maximal regularity technique, one can see the works by Hieber et al. [26, 27] and Giga et al. [21, 22]. Recently, global well-posedness of strong solutions to the coupled system of the primitive equations to the moisture system with either one component or multi components of moisture, and the hydrostatic approximation from compressible Navier-Stokes equations to compressible primitive equations were also established, see [13, 24, 28, 29] and [18, 47], respectively. For the results of compressible primitive equations, one can see [44, 45, 46, 19, 32, 52].
All the results mentioned in the above paragraph are for the system that with full dissipation. In the last few years, some developments concerning the global well-posedness to the anisotropic primitive equations were also made, see Cao­Titi [5] and Cao­Li­Titi [3, 4, 6, 7, 8], which in particular imply that the primitive equations with only horizontal viscosities are globally well-posed as long as one still has either horizontal or vertical diffusivities, see also [15] and [30]. Notably, different from the primitive equations with either full viscosity or only horizontal viscosity, the inviscid primitive equations may develop finite time singularities, see Cao et al. [11], Wong [54], Ghoul et al. [20] and Ibrahim et al. [31].
1.3. Main results: rigourous justification of hydrostatic approximation. As already mentioned at the beginning of this introduction, the rigorous justifications of the limiting process in the case  = 2, i.e., the convergence from (1.4) with  = 2 to (1.9) has been established by Aze´rad-Guille´n [1] in the weak setting and by Li-Titi [38] in the strong setting, respectively, see also Furukawa et al. [16] and [17] for some generalizations in the Lp-Lq type spaces. To our best knowledge, the corresponding justification in the case  > 2, i.e., the convergence from from (1.4) with  > 2 to (1.10), is still unknown, and we are going to address this problem in the current paper.
Now, we are ready to state our main results. We first consider the case that v0  H1(). In this case, noticing that u0 can be only regarded as an element in L2() in general, one can only consider the weak solutions to the anisotropic incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (1.4). For the

6

J. LI, EDRISS S. TITI, AND G. YUAN

primitive equations (1.10), the local well-posed result in [3] guarantees a unique
local in time strong solution and, moreover, it can be extended to be a global one, if one has further that zv0  Lm() for some m > 2. As a result, we have the following local and global strong convergence results:

Theorem 1.1. Suppose that  > 2. Let v0  H1() be a periodic function satis-

fying H ·

on

M.

Assume that v0 satisfies the symmetric condition

(1.8) and that w0 is determined by (1.11). Denote by (v, w) and v an arbitrary

Leray-Hopf weak solution to (1.4) and the unique local strong solution to (1.10),

respectively, subject to (1.5)­(1.7) and with the same initial data (v0, w0). Let t be

the time of existence of v and set

(V, W, P) = (v - v, w - w, p - p).

Then, the following two items hold: (i) It holds that

(ii) Suppose in addition that zv0  Lm() for some m > 2. Then, all the above

convergence and estimate still hold if replacing t by any finite time T  (0, ). In

where K is a nonnegative continuously increasing function on [0, ) determined by v0 H1 , zv0 m, L1, L2, and t.
Next, we consider the case that v0  H2(). In this case, by (1.11), it is clear that u0 = (v0, w0)  H1(). Then, by the local well-posedness theory of strong solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, see, e.g., [12, 50], for each  > 0, there is a unique local strong solution (v, w) to (1.4), subject to (1.5)­ (1.7). For the primitive equations (1.10), the global well-posedness results in [3, 4] guarantee the global existence of strong solutions to (1.10), subject to (1.5)­(1.7). Then, we have the following strong convergence results.

Theorem 1.2. In addition to the conditions in Theorem 1.1, suppose that v0  H2(). Denote by (v, w) and v the unique local strong solution to (1.4) and the unique global strong solution to (1.10), respectively, subject to (1.5)­(1.7) and with the same initial data (v0, w0). Set
(V, W) = (v - v, w - w),
and let T be the maximal time of existence of (v, w).

HYDROSTATIC APPROXIMATION AND PRIMITIVE EQUATIONS JUSTIFICATION 7

Then, for any finite time T > 0 and  > 2, there is a small positive constant T depending only on v0 H2 , T , L1 and L2, such that T > T , as long as   (0, T ),

Remark 1.1. Comparing with the results obtained in [38], where the strong convergence and error estimates are globally in time or in other words uniformly in time for the primitive equations that with full dissipation, the convergence and error estimates in the current paper depend on the time intervals in which the problems are considered, as shown in Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2. This is caused by the absence of the vertical viscosity in the primitive equations (1.10) which is treated carefully in the current paper, as both the strong convergence and error estimates depend crucially on the a priori estimates for the relevant limiting system, i.e., the primitive equations, while these a priori estimates available for the primite equations (1.10) depend on the time interval.

It is interesting to compare the results in the case  > 2 with those in the case

 = 2. On the one hand, in the case  > 2, as shown in Theorem 1.1 and Theorem

1.2,

the

convergence

rate

O(

 2

),



=

min{2,

becomes

weaker

and

weaker

when  approaches 2. On the other hand, in the case  = 2, the results in [38]

show that the corresponding convergence rate is O(). By comparing the results

[38] in the case  = 2 and our results, one may expect some better convergence

rate, say O(()), such that ()  0 for some positive 0 when  approaches

2. Unfortunately, this seems impossible, as the following subtracted system for

(V, W) has the quantity -2z2v as a source term in the V equations:

tV - H V - -2z2V + (U · )V + H P

+(U · )v + (u · )V = -2z2v,

H · V + zW = 0, 2(tW - H W - -2z2W + U · W + U · w + u · W)

+zP = -2(tw - H w - -2z2w + u · w).

While in the case  = 2 as studied in [38], the corresponding subtracted system does

not have any source terms in V equations. These indicate the essential differences between the cases  > 2 and  = 2, or in other words, the differences of the convergence from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to the isotropic and

anisotropic primitive equations. The rest of this paper is arranged as follows: in section 2, we collect some
preliminary results which will be used in the subsequent sections; in section 3, we

cite some results about the local and global well-posedness of strong solutions to

8

the primitive equations with only horizontal viscosity and carry out some a priori estimates; finally, we give the proofs of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2 in section 4 and section 5, respectively.

2. Preliminaries

The following inequality will be used frequently in the a priori estimates. Since it can be proved exactly in the same way as in [10] and [3], we omit the proof here.

3. Global well-posed of primitive equations with only horizontal viscosities
The global well-posedness of strong solutions to the primitive equations with only horizontal viscosities has been established in [3] and [4]. In this section, we improve slightly the result in [3], see Proposition 3.3, below.
The following H1 local well-posedness result is proved in [3].

Note that zv has higher integrability in [0, t], in case it has higher integrability at the initial time. In fact we have the following:

Proposition 3.2. Assume in addition to the conditions in Proposition 3.1 that zv0  Lm() with m > 2. Then, it holds that

which leads to the conclusion by Proposition 3.1.

Now, we can extend the local strong solution to be a global one as stated in the
following proposition. Note that in comparison to the global well-posedness result in [3], the required condition v0  L() in [3] is removed here.

Proposition 3.3. Under the assumption of Proposition 3.2, the unique local strong solution v stated in Proposition 3.1 can be extended uniquely to be a global one such that for any finite time T  (0, ),

where J : [0, )  R+ is a continuously increasing function determined only by v0 H1, zv0 m, m, t, L1 and L2. Here t is given in Proposition 3.1.

Proof. Due to (iii) of Proposition 3.1, it has

By the Sobolev imbedding inequality, this implies

Thanks to this

and applying Lemma 2.2 with p1 = p2 = 6 and p3 = 2, one obtains

sup |v(x, t)|  C(2 H v 6(t) +

C t ,

and in particular v(t)  L(). With the aid of this and by (iii) of Proposition 3.1 and Proposition 3.2, one has v|t=t  L()  H1() and zv|t=t  Lm(). As a result, by viewing t as the initial time, one can apply the result in [3] to extend the local solution v uniquely to be a global one and the corresponding estimate as
stated in Proposition 3.3 holds. The proof is complete.

Finally, for the H2 initial data, the following global well-posedness and a priori estimate are cited from [4].

Proposition 3.4.

4. Proof of Theorem 1.1

Since v0  H1() and recalling (1.11), the initial data u0 = (v0, w0) can only be regarded as an element of L2(). Thus, one needs to consider the weak form of the scaled Navier-Stokes equations (1.4). By Proposition 3.1, the unique solution v to (1.10), subject to (1.5)­(1.7) has the regularities v  L(0, t; H1()), tv  L2(0, t; L2()), and H v  L2(0, t; H1()). Thanks to these facts, by virtue of a
density argument, one can check that (v, w) can be chosen as testing function in the
weak form in (iii) of Definition 1.1. As a result, we have the following proposition.

Proposition 4.1.

Given a periodic function v0  H1() with H ·

1 -1

v0

dz

=

0

and satisfying the symmetric condition (1.8). Let (v, w) an arbitrary Leray-Hopf

weak solution to (1.4) and v the unique local strong solution to (1.10) , subject to

(1.5)­(1.7). Then, the following integral equality holds

for any t0  [0, t], where t is the time of existence of v.

Proof. The proof is exactly the same as in Proposition 4.1 of [38] and, thus, it is omitted here.

Remark 4.1. If we further assume that zv0  Lm(), m > 2, then by Proposition 3.3, for any finite time T > 0, we can obtain the unique strong solution v in [0, T ]
to (1.10), and the result in Proposition 4.1 holds for any finite time, in other words, one can replace t by any positive time T  [0, ).

Thanks to the Proposition 4.1 and Remark 4.1, we are ready to establish the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. (i) It suffices to prove

as in this case the a priori estimates used for proving (i) are valid up to any finite time T .

5. Proof of Theorem 1.2

Suppose v0  H2() with H ·

1 -1

v0

dz

=

0.

Then, by (1.11), it has u0 =

(v0, w0)  H1() and  · u0 = 0. By the classical theory of Navier-Stokes equations

(see [12] and [50]), there is a unique local strong solution (v, w) to (1.4), subject

to (1.5)­(1.7). Denote by T the maximal existence time of (v, w). Let v be the

global strong solution to (1.10) established in Proposition 3.4.

Here we still denote U = (V, W), and V = v - v, W = w - w. Since both

v and (v, w) are strong solutions to (1.10) and (1.4), respectively, one can check that (V, W) satisfies

(5.1)

tV - H V - -2z2V + (U · )V + H P + (U · )v + (u · )V = -2z2v,

(5.2)

H · V + zW = 0,

(5.3)

2(tW - H W - -2z2W + U · W + U · w + u · W) + zP = -2(tw - H w - -2z2w + u · w),

in L2(0, T; L2()), where P = p - p. Since v0  H2(), it is clear that (4.5) still holds when t  [0, T). In other
words, the following holds:

Besides the basic energy estimate stated in the above, we also have the first order
energy estimate of (V, W) in the following proposition.

16

proving the conclusion.

The next proposition shows that the smallness condition of (H V, W) in Proposition 5.1 holds for any finite time T > 0 provided   (0, T ), where T is a positive constant depending on T . As a result, the local strong solution (v, w) of (1.4) exists in [0, T ] for   (0, T ).

Proposition 5.2. Let T be the maximal existence time of the unique local strong solution (v, w) to (1.4), subject to (1.5)­(1.7). Then for any finite time T > 0,
there exists a positive constant T depending only on v0 H2 , T , L1 and L2, such that T < T, as long as   (0, T ), and that

By the definition of t, this implies t = T and, consequently, (5.8) holds for any t  [0, T).
We claim that T  T for any   (0, T ). Assume in contradiction that T < T , i.e., T < T . This implies the maximal existence time of (v, w) is finite and, consequently, recalling Proposition 3.4, it must have

lim sup (

which contradicts to (5.8). This contradiction implies T  T and thus T  T . Thanks this and combining (5.7) and (5.8), one obtains

This proves the conclusion.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. For any finite time T > 0, let T be the constant in Proposition 5.2. Then, by Proposition 5.2, for any   (0, T ), the scaled Navier-Stokes system (1.4)­(1.7) exists a unique strong solution (v, w) in [0, T ]. While the following estimate holds

which is exactly estimate stated in Theorem 1.2. The convergences are the direct corollaries of the above estimate. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.2.
