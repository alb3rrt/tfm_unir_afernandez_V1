Abstract: We study the high-scale validity of a Type-X two Higgs doublet scenario which provides an explanation of the observed value of muon (g - 2). This region admits of a pseudoscalar physical state, which is well below the observed 125-GeV scalar in mass. A second neutral scalar particle can be both above and below 125 GeV in such a scenario. Admissible regions in the parameter space are obtained by using the most recent data on muon (g - 2), theoretical constraints such as low-scale perturbativity and vacuum stability, and also all experimental constraints, including the available LHC results. Among other things, both the aforesaid orders of CP-even neutral scalar masses are included in our benchmark studies. Two-loop renormalisation group equations are used to predict the values of various couplings at high scales, and the regions in the space spanned by low-scale parameters, which retain perturbative unitarity as well as vacuum stability upto various scales are identified. We thus conclude that such a scenario, while successfully explaining the observed muon (g - 2), can be valid upto energy scales ranging from 104 GeV to the Planck scale, thus opening up directions of thought on its ultraviolet completion.

1 Introduction
It is often speculated that the spontaneous symmetry-breaking sector of the electroweak theory may include additional ingredients, over and above the single complex Higgs doublet postulated in the `minimal' original framework. The simplest and most obvious extension is a scenario with two complex scalar doublets. The spectrum of physical fields in such a case, after the absorption of three Goldstone bosons, consists of two CP-odd neutral scalars, one CP-even neutral scalar and a pair of mutually conjugate charged scalar bosons. While the doublets can both acquire vacuum expectation values (VEV) in such a scenario, the Yukawa couplings to fermions are more model-specific, depending on the various possibilities restricted by the principle of natural flavour conservation. Various phenomenological features of a two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) are accordingly decided.
A scenario of particular interest is the Type-X 2HDM where one of the scalar doublets couples only to quarks, and the other, to leptons. The doublet that couples to quarks dominates the mass eigenstate corresponding to the 125-GeV scalar that has been experimentally discovered. We are concerned with this kind of a theory in the present work.
A rather striking consequence of a Type-X 2HDM is that it admits of scalar physical states considerably lighter than 125 GeV, consistently with all experimental observations so far. In particular, the neutral pseudoscalar here can be well below 100 GeV. This is worthy of special mention because such a light pseudoscalar can mediate contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment, leading to a closer agreement with the experimental observation [1­3]. Keeping this in mind, the region of the parameter space answering to such a light pseudoscalar has been investigated from various angles in recent times, including its implications for the LHC [4­14].
For experimental detectability, one largely depends on the pair-production of the light pseudoscalar in the decay of the 125-GeV scalar, a process whose branching ratio (and hence its parameter space) is restricted by the four-lepton branching ratio. This is because the pseudoscalar in the alignment limit is dominated by the doublet giving masses to leptons. Also, the 125-GeV particle can be either the lighter or the heavier of the two CP-even neutral scalars. A deciding factor here is sin( - ), where  is the mixing angle between the real parts of the two doublets, and tan  is the ratio of the two VEVs. In addition, wrong-sign Yukawa coupling is an allowed feature of a Type-X 2HDM of the kind we are interested in. The sign of sin( - ) and the function tan  are of primary importance in this context. The parameter tan  plays crucial role throughout our analysis. This is especially because the closest agreement with the experimental value of muon g - 2 (henceforth to be called gµ - 2) can be achieved for large ( > 20) tan . The viability of such tan  in this scenario, from both phenomenological and theoretical angles, is therefore worth studying.
The question we ask here is: can the aforesaid aspects of low-energy phenomenology provide any hint of the UV completion of this scenario? If so, then not only does the muon anomalous magnetic moment get related to high-scale physics, but we also build towards some insights into features such as the signs of Yukawa interactions at low energy. With this in view, we have undertaken a detailed study of the high-scale behavior of
­2­

the various quartic couplings in the scalar potential of the Type-X 2HDM. Limits on its high-scale validity then arise from vacuum stability, perturbativity and unitarity of the couplings. This exercise has been carried out across various regions of the parameter space, including both right-and wrong-sign Yukawa interaction regions, where the muon anomalous magnetic moment is better explained, and all other theoretical and experimental constraints are satisfied. We make use of two-loop renormalisation group (RG) equations. However, it is demonstrated in some illustrative cases that the difference in the results is not qualitative, as compared to those obtained with one-loop RGs. Therefore, the explanation of the allowed regions of the parameter space corresponding to various levels of high-scale validity has been often given by referring to the one-loop RGs where the effects of different parameters of the theory are more transparent.
The plan of this work is as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the Type-X two Higgs doublet model and its various aspects relevant for our analysis. Section 3 summarises the implications of the observed gµ - 2 for this specific model. We discuss various theoretical and experimental constraints on this model and the allowed parameter space in Section 4. In Section 5, we study the renormalization group evolution of various couplings for a few benchmarks. We next identify in Section 6, the regions of parameter space which are valid upto various high scales and are also interesting from the perpective of the anomalous magnetic moment of muon as well as relevant collider searches. This way we try to explore the validity of Type-X 2HDM as a UV-complete theory. Finally, we conclude our analysis in Section 7.

2 Type-X two Higgs Doublet Model

The most general scalar potential involving two scalar doublets with hypercharge Y = 1, under the assumption of a softly broken discrete Z2 symmetry, is given by [15]

V = m211(11) + m222(22) - m212(12 + h.c.)

(2.1)

We assume CP-conservation, in which case all i's and m212 are real. The two complex Higgs doublets with hypercharge Y = 1 can be written as

.

(2.2)

Where v1 and v2 are the vacuum expectation values with v2 = v12 + v22 = (246 GeV)2 and tan  = v2/v1. After electroweak symmetry breaking, we obtain five physical states, two neutral CP-even scalars, the lighter of which will be called h, and the heavier H, one neutral pseudoscalar A, and a pair of charged scalars H±.

­3­

In Type-X 2HDM the Yukawa interactions can be given as

-LY ukawa = Yu2 QL ~ 2 uR + Yd2 QL 2 dR + Y 1 LL 1 eR + h.c.

(2.3)

in which QTL = (uL , dL), LTL = (L , lL), and 1,2 = i21,2. Yu2, Yd2 and Y 1 are the couplings of the up, down quarks and leptons with the two doublets, family indices are suppressed.
The factors by which the Standard Model(SM) Higgs interaction strengths need to be scaled to obtain the neutral scalar Yukawa couplings, are

yhfi = [sin( - ) + cos( - )f ] , yHfi = [cos( - ) - sin( - )f ] , yAfi = -if (for u), yAfi = if (for d, ),
with   - tan , u = d  1/ tan .

(2.4)

The corresponding charged Higgs Yukawa couplings are:



LY

=-

2 H+ v

u¯i [d (VCKM )ij mdj PR - u mui (VCKM )ij PL] dj +  ¯m PR

+ h.c., (2.5)

in which i, j = 1, 2, 3. The couplings of gauge boson pairs with the neutral scalars are given by

yhV = sin( - ) × gSVM , yHV = cos( - ) × gSVM ,

(2.6)

Where V denotes W or Z and gSVM is the coupling strength of the SM Higgs with a gauge boson pair.
Furthermore, Yukawa couplings here may or may not have the same sign as in the SM case [16],

yhfi × yhV > 0 for SM - like coupling or right - sign(RS), yhfi × yhV < 0 for wrong - sign(WS).

(2.7)

This can happen, for example, for down-type Yukawa couplings in Type II 2HDM [16] as well. However, in Type-X 2HDM the wrong-sign Yukawa coupling can arise in the lepton Yukawa sector alone, unless one allows tan  < 1. In case of the SM-like coupling, the 125GeV Higgs couplings are very close to those in the SM, which is the so-called alignment limit. Now in the wrong-sign regime, the absolute values of yh and yhV should still be close to unity because of the restrictions of 125-GeV Higgs signal data [17, 18]. Moreover, there are two scenarios, a) The lightest CP-even scalar h is SM-like ie. mh = mhSM = 125 GeV, we call this Scenario 1 and b) when the heavier CP-even scalar H is SM-like, ie. mH = mhSM = 125 GeV, we call this Scenario 2. Both scenario 1 and 2 can in principle lead to right-sign or wrong-sign of Yukawa coupling depending on the conditions stated in Equation 2.7.

­4­

Let us first consider Scenario 1 in the right- and wrong-sign regions. In scenario 1, the 125-GeV Higgs couplings are:
yh = sin( - ) - cos( - ) tan , yhV sin( - )
In the alignment limit | sin( - )|  1. The following possibilities emerge depending on the sign of sin( - ) and range of tan . · For sin( - ) < 0, cos( - ) > 0, yh takes the form -(1 + ). yh × yhV > 0 and it corresponds to right-sign region.
· On the other hand, for sin( - ) > 0, cos( - ) > 0, yh takes the form (1 - ). This case also corresponds to the right-sign region. · When sin( - ) > 0 and cos( - ) > 0 and tan  > 10, yh becomes negative and yh × yhV < 0. This scenario gives rise to wrong-sign lepton-Yukawa coupling.
Having discussed the coupling structure in Scenario 1, we will now explore the same for Scenario 2. In this case, the heavier CP-even Higgs is the observed 125 GeV Higgs ie. mH = 125 GeV. Here the couplings of H with the leptons and gauge bosons take the following forms.
yH = cos( - ) + sin( - ) tan , yhV cos( - ) In the alignment limit, | sin( - )| << 1. The sign of sin( - ) and ranges of tan  in this case will give rise to the following conditions. · For sin( -) > 0, cos( -) > 0, yH takes the form (1+ ) and yH × yHV > 0. Therefore this case corresponds to the right-sign region.
· On the other hand, for sin( - ) < 0, cos( - ) > 0, yH takes the form (1 - ), yH × yHV > 0. Hence this region also gives rise to right-sign lepton-Yukawa coupling. · When sin( - ) < 0 and cos( - ) > 0 and tan  > 10, yH becomes negative and yH × yHV < 0. In this scenario, wrong-sign condition is satisfied.
Throughout the discussion concerning Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, is assumed to be an extremely small positive quantity. One should note that tan ( > 10) in the right-sign region will give rise to Yukawa scale factors widely differing from unity (therefore disfavored by the Higgs signal strength data), unless | sin( - )|(Scenario 1) or | cos( - )|(Scenario 2) is very close to 1. Notably, cos( - ) is kept positive in all the above cases, since the sign of the Yukawa interactions are unambiguously decided by ( - ) lying in two of the four quadrants. The required ranges of tan  are not altered by such quadrant choice.
The main motivation of the present study is to explore the possibility of having a light ( < 100 GeV) pseudoscalar in Type-X 2HDM, which makes it easier to match the observed value of gµ - 2. We will see in the following section that large tan  regions will be favored from this particular requirement. There will be further overlap or tension between various theoretical and experimental constraints on the model parameter space. These are decisive in understanding the high-scale validity of the scenario, which is our ultimate purpose here.

3 Explanation of gµ - 2

The anomalous magnetic moment of muon is an early triumph of quantum field theory. In

today's context, the long-standing discrepancy between SM prediction and experimental

observation [19] hints towards new physics. The recent result from Fermilab [2, 3] has

strengthened this disagreement further. The future E34 experiment at J-PARC [20] may

shed new light on this tension between theory and experiment.

[21­43],

estimate [44] being

aSµM = 116591810(43) × 10-11

(3.1)

While the most recent experimental bound is obtained by combining the Fermilab data(2021) [2, 3] and earlier BNL(2006) data [1].

aeµxp = 116592040(54) × 10-11

(3.2)

This may be contrasted with the earlier limits from BNL data [1].

aeµxp-BNL = 116592089(63) × 10-11

(3.3)

Thus there is approximately 4.2 discrepancy when one uses the combined experimental result (Equation 3.2).

aµ = aeµxp - aSµM = 251(59) × 10-11

(3.4)

On the other hand, a discrepancy at the level of 3.7 is seen, if one uses only the BNL data (Equation 3.3).

aBµ NL = aeµxp-BNL - aSµM = 279(76) × 10-11

(3.5)

We consider one loop as well as two loop Bar-Zee type contribution to aµ in Type-X

2HDM. It has been shown in earlier works [45, 46], that the two-loop Bar-Zee diagrams

dominate over the one-loop contributions, both of which are shown in figures 1-4. Al-

though the two loop diagrams suffer from a loop suppression factor, they also have an

namely, t, b, , H±, W ± (see Figure 2). One should note that in Type-X 2HDM, the con-

tribution from the  loop gets additional enhancement factor from the  coupling with

pseudoscalar(A) in the large tan  region. The enhancement factor in general dominates

over the aforementioned loop suppression. The diagram involving W ± in the loop (Figure 2

bottom), will have negligible contribution due to suppression in the coupling between W ±

bosons and the non-standard CP-even Higgs in the alignment limit. We also consider the

Bar-Zee diagrams where charged Higgs replaces the neutral Higgs and also W ± substitutes

the internal  (see Figure 3 and 4). The contribution from these diagrams can be sizable

in some regions of the parameter space [46].

The resulting constraints on the mA - tan  plane is shown in Figure 5. 3 upper and lower bound on the experimentally observed central value of aµ have been used in the scan. While such scans have been carried out earlier [47, 48], we have (a) used the most recent constraints and (b) have used all new physics diagrams exhaustively in our analysis.

The red bands on both sides of this region, denote the additional regions which are allowed at the 3 level before Fermilab data came into existence. The red band on the lower side is consistent even when the new data are included, so long as one allows experimental values to be undersaturated by Type-X 2HDM. On the other hand, points in the upper red band overshoots the 3 limit arising from the combined data, and therefore, may be taken to be in conflict with the
­8­

most recent experiments. It is clear that a low mass pseudoscalar with an enhanced coupling to the  leptons
will give significant contribution to aµ(see Figure 2(top left)), especially for large tan . Overall, low mA and large tan  region is favored in the light of gµ - 2 data in our model. In this work we are interested to know the high-scale behavior of this particular region of parameter space. Before exploring the high-scale validity of this region of the parameter space, we would like to consider the other important theoretical as well as experimental constraints on such a scenario.
Figure 5. The allowed region in mA - tan  plane from gµ - 2 data at 3 level. The limits have been obtained by marginalizing over all other parameters of the 2HDM, except the mass of one of the neutral CP-even scalars is set at 125 GeV. The yellowish interior corresponds to the combined constraints from older [1] and recent data [2, 3], while the red regions on both sides show the additional regions allowed when only the older data are used.
4 Other constraints on model parameters
4.1 Constraints from electroweak precision observables The custodial SU(2) is a symmetry of the tree-level 2HDM potential and can be broken at the loop level due to corrections to weak boson masses as well as weak couplings by extra scalars in 2HDM. Electroweak precision measurements of the oblique parameters, have been performed by the Gfitter group [49]. This restricts the mass difference between the charged scalar and the non-standard CP-even scalar |m| = |mh/H - mH±| , depending on mA and values of mH± [47]. The status of two Higgs doublet models in the light of global electroweak data has been presented in [50]. The allowed parameter space in mA - m plane is shown in Figure 6 with color-coded representation of mH±. We mention here that we have considered the elliptic contour in the S - T plane computed with U as a free parameter. This choice leaves us with a less constrained parameter space than the scenario when U is fixed at 0.
It can be seen from Figure 6 that, in the pseudoscalar mass range of our interest (mA < 100 GeV), when mh/H < mH±, it is possible to get upto |m| < 50 GeV, only in

the limit of low m±H ( < 200 GeV). Notably, large positive m (upto a TeV or so) can be allowed when A and H± are closely degenerate.
4.2 Theoretical constraints
Theoretical constraints include perturbativity, unitarity and vacuum stability conditions at the electroweak scale . Effects of these constraints on various 2HDMs have been studied in detail in earlier works [51­53]. It has been pointed out that large separation between mA and mH± is disfavored from the requirement of vacuum stability and perturbativity. We concentrate on the low mA region and therefore it is crucial to look at the allowed upper limit on m±H in this scenario.
· perturbativity and unitarity: If 2HDM is a perturbative quantum field theory at a givenscale, it would imply, all quartic couplings CHiHjHkHl < 4 and all Yukawa couplings Yj < 4. Further, unitarity bound on the tree level scattering amplitude of the Higgses and longitudinal parts of EW gauge bosons put an upper bound on the eigenvalues |ai|  8 of the 2  2 scattering matrices [54, 55].
The physical masses can be written as a function of the quartic couplings in the following manner.

m2A

=

m212 sin  cos 

- 5v2

m2H ±



m2A

+

1 2

v2(5

- 4)

(4.1) (4.2)

It is clear from Equation 4.2 that m2H± - m2A is proportional to 5 - 4 which should be less than 3 + 12 from the requirement of vacuum stability (see Equation 4.6). Therefore
these conditions along with the requirement of perturbativity ie. CHiHjHkHl < 4 puts an upper limit on the mass square difference m2H± - m2A.

­ 10 ­

In what follows, we translate these constraints into those of the parameter space for both right- and wrong-sign Yukawa couplings. With this in view, we first express the quartic couplings in terms of physical masses and mixing angles.

It is clear from the expression of 1 in Equation 4.3 that, to have it in the perturbative

limit, the soft Z2 breaking parameter m212

.

Also the perturbativity condition of

the quartic couplings 4 and 5 implies m2H± - m2A < 4v2 which translates to the limit

mH± < 870 GeV for very low mA.

· Vacuum stability: Vacuum stability demands there can exist no direction in the field space in which V  -. This implies the following conditions on the quartic couplings of the Higgs potential [56­58].

1,2 > 0 ,

(4.4)

3 > - 12

(4.5)

|5| < 3 + 4 + 12

(4.6)

 The last condition in Equation 4.6 can be rewritten as 3 + 4 - 5 > - 12 for mH > mA. One of the key features to note is that, the upper limits on the heavy Higgs masses show quite different behaviors in the right-sign and wrong-sign limit of the Yukawa

couplings [59]. The light-Higgs Yukawa couplings for leptons yh in Type-X 2HDM can be

expressed as

sin 

yh

=

- cos 



sin(

- ) - tan  cos(

- ).

(4.7)

The 125 GeV-Higgs boson couplings are experimentally found to be very much SM-like,

implying, in particular, | sin( - )| 1 and |yh|  1. This can be achieved when tan  cos( - )  0 (leading to the right-sign lepton coupling yh  +1), or in the large tan  limit with tan  cos( - )  2 (leading to the wrong-sign coupling yh  -1). Using the Equations 4.7 and 4.3, one finds

(4.9)

which puts a strong upper bound, mH < 250 GeV for low mA, which is consistent with [47]. On the other hand, in the wrong-sign limit (yh sin( - )  -1), mH can be arbitrarily large with the condition sin2( - ) + yh sin( - )  0 being trivially satisfied in the alignment limit. These particular properties of wrong-sign and right-sign regions can be
seen from Figures 7(a) and (b).

4.3 Constraints from the direct search at colliders
· LEP data:
The earliest collider constraint on the masses of charged and neutral scalars came from the LEP experiments [60]. The charged Higgs has been searched for at LEP in the process e+e-  /Z  H+H- with subsequent decay H±   ± . Direct search at LEP in this channel provides a lower limit on charged Higgs mass mH± as a function of BR(H±   ± ). The strongest bound results in mH± > 90 GeV [60] at 95% CL., considering BR(H±     100%). However, the upper limit varies only mildly with the BR(H±    ) and therefore is fairly model-independent. On the other hand, another LEP search in the channel pp  hA  4 also puts an upper limit on BR(h   + -)× BR(A   + -) × RhA(mixing between two doublets) for mA + mh upto 200 GeV [61].

· LHC data on the SM-like Higgs:
An important constraint comes from the direct search for 125-GeV Higgs decaying into two light pseudoscalar final states when it is kinematically allowed. The upper bound on this branching ratio puts severe constraint on the parameter space of this model. As

­ 12 ­

gµ - 2 constraint pushes us to a region tilted towards large tan  with small mA, it can

lead to substantial branching fraction in the decay mode hSM  AA, when this particular

decay is kinematically allowed ie.

mA <

mh 2

.

At large tan , pseudoscalar A decays to

 + - pair with > 99% branching fraction, leaving a small branching fraction ( 0.35%)

in the µ+µ- final state [6, 7, 62, 63]. LHC searches for hSM  AA in the 4 or 2 + 2µ

final state disfavors a large BR(hSM  AA). We impose the most stringent upper limit BR(hSM  AA) < 0.04, consistent with the upper bounds provided by the experimental results [64, 64]1.

First we consider Scenario 1 ie. mh = 125 GeV. The partial decay width of Higgs

decaying to a pair of pseudoscalars is given by

(h  AA) = 1 gh2AA 32 mh

1 - 4m2A/m2h

(4.10)

Using the relations between the quartic couplings 's and the physical masses and Higgs mixing parameter m212, in the alignment limit | sin( - )|  1, hAA coupling [58] takes the following form.

order to ensure perturbativity of the quartic couplings. If we demand perturbativity as well

as the condition, ghAA  0, Equation 4.12 implies yh sin( -) < 0. In other words, wrongsign lepton Yukawa coupling is more favored in Scenario 1, when one demands smallness

of BR(hSM  AA) as well as perturbativity of the quartic couplings. The other possibility is to consider the case when the heavier CP even scalar is the

SM-like Higgs, ie mH = 125 GeV, which is our Scenario 2. However, in this case the

LEP

limit implies

either

mA

or

mh

can

be

than

mH 2

[65].

(4.13)

Here too, like the previous scenario, the limit on BR(H  AA) will indicate extremely small

value of the coupling gHAA, whose expression in the alignment limit ie. | cos( - )|  1 is

given as follows:

1The limit is taken on the strongest side in our analysis. It may become slightly relaxed with varying mA. Thus our study is conservative.

in

the

limit gHAA  0, yH cos( - ) will be positive for the most part of our parameter space.

Therefore we can conclude that the right-sign region will be favored in case of Scenario 2.

We will see the implications of these in the next section.

· Signal strengths of the 125-GeV scalar
Important limits come from the signal strength measurements of the 125-GeV Higgs in various final states including , ZZ, W W , b¯b and   final states [17, 18]. The experimental data indicate that the gauge boson and Yukawa couplings of the 125-GeV scalar are very close to their SM value. Therefore in our analysis we confine ourselves to the alignment limit ie. |yhV/H |  1 (yhV = sin( - ) for Scenario 1 and yHV = cos( - ) for Scenario 2) and |yh/H | is also close to unity. This in turn implies that tan  can not be very large in the RS region. However, in the WS region this condition gets slightly relaxed and |yhV/H | can deviate slightly further from unity, within the allowed range and tan  can be large as long as |yh/H | is close to 1. Another important constraint comes from the direct search for 125-GeV Higgs decaying into two light pseudoscalar final states, when it is kinematically allowed. The upper bound on this branching ratio translates into severe constraint on the parameter space of this model. We have discussed the effect of this constraint on our parameter space in detail in a previous subsection 4.3.

· Direct search for heavier (pseudo)scalars at the LHC:
Collider searches for the non-standard neutral scalar states also put constraints on the parameter space of interest. Such searches are performed at the LHC, in various SM final states. As we are particularly interested in the low pseudoscalar mass region with its enhanced coupling to leptons, the limits which are crucial for our analyses, come from the search for low pseudoscalar produced in association with a pair of b quarks and decaying into   final state [66, 67]. Constraints from the search for low mass (pseudo)scalar produced in association with b¯b and decaying into b¯b [68, 69] has also been taken into account.
We have also taken into account the upper limits from CP-even non-standard scalars( h/H) decaying to   [52] final state. CMS has also looked for decay involving two nonstandard Higgs bosons such as h/H  AZ [70, 71], H  hh [72­74] and h/H  V V [75­ 77].
At the LHC, the charged Higgs search can be produced in several ways. When m±H < mt, charged Higgs can be produced from the decay of top quark(t  bH±). This decay

­ 14 ­

has been searched for in   [78, 79] and cs¯ [80, 81] final state. These searches put an upper limit on BR(t  bH±) × (H±   /cs¯). The other important search mode at the LHC is (pp  tbH±) in the final states   [79, 82] and cs¯ [83, 84] and t¯b [85].
The most stringent bounds in the context of direct search for non-standard scalars come from pp  h/H/A    and pp  tbH±(H±   ). Although in Type-X model at large tan , the neutral non-standard scalars decay to   with almost 100% BR and the charged Higgs decays to   final state almost exclusively, the production cross-section is suppressed at large tan  as the quark couplings scale as 1/ tan . This in turn puts an lower bound on tan  [52].

4.4 Allowed parameter space

Having listed all these constraints, our next task is to use them to constrain a type-X 2HDM, for both the scenarios 1 and 2. We take this up in the present section.

· Scenario 1: This scenario corresponds to the case, where lighter CP-even scalar is the SM-like Higgs boson. One can further categorize this scenario with WS and RS regions depending on leptonic coupling of h, as discussed earlier. We scan our parameter space in the following ranges:

mH  [125, 870] GeV, m±H  [125, 870] GeV, mA  [20, 100] GeV, tan   [20, 100],

sin( - )  [0.99, 1], m212 

m2H tan 

-

200,

m2H tan

.

We also mention here that 6 = 7 = 0, as we only consider soft Z2 breaking terms.

WS domain which alleviates gµ - 2 discrepancy. On the other hand, in the RS region,

large tan  is less favored. As discussed earlier in Section 4, we do not get a small enough

BR(h  AA) < 4% for mA < mh/2, as long as we are in the RS domain. This is clear from Figure 8.

In Figure 9 (a) and (b), we show the allowed region in mH - tan  plane. We can see

that moderate tan  regions are favored by the theoretical constraints, especially when mH

is large. In addition to that, the upper bound from BR(hSM  AA), pushes the allowed

range of tan  to further lower side.

Figure 9 (c) and (d) displays the allowed region in the R(-) - tan  plane, where

R(-) is defined as sgn[sin( - )] × cos( - ). On the whole, while the RS case admits

sin( - ) with both signs, it is restricted to positive values only for WS. Furthermore, the

In Figure 9 (e) and (f), we plot yh × sin( - ) against R(-). The limit on BR(h  AA) for mA < mh/2 does not allow much deviation of yh × sin( - ) from unity, which

is also consistent with the alignment limit. In Figure 9(f), one can see that, both positive

and negative signs for sin( - ) are equally consistent with the alignment limit(|yh| × sin( - )  1) in the RS region.

In this scenario, the heavier CP-even scalar H is the SM-like Higgs. To get the allowed regions in this scenario, we scan our parameter space in the following range:

mh  [80, 125] GeV, m±H  [80, 180] GeV, mA  [20, 100] GeV, tan   [20, 100],

the other hand, we can get a large parameter space both in WS and RS region, which can

In Figure 11 (a) and (b), the allowed regions in mh - tan  plane are shown for the WS

and RS respectively. We can see that, in the RS case, low to moderate tan  will be favored

from the requirement of low BR(hSM  AA). However, when the difference between the

lighter and heavier CP-even scalar masses decreases, even larger tan  becomes allowed.

In Figure 11 (c) and (d), we show the allowed region in sin( - ) - tan  plane where

both positive and negative sin( - ) is allowed for RS cases, but WS is attained with only

negative sin( - ).

In Figure 11 (e) and (f), one can see similar behavior as scenario 1, where small

5 The running of various couplings
5.1 The Renormalization Group Equations(RGEs)
The parameters constrained above are considered at the electroweak scale, set at the pole mass of top quark ( 173.34 GeV). We now investigate how they evolve at higher scales and thus obtain their domain of validity in the light of vacuum stability(following [57]) and perturbative unitarity(following [55]). This yields the cut-off scale cUuVt-off .
In this subsection we present the one-loop RG equations for the various quartic couplings as well as the gauge and third generation Yukawa couplings. For actual presentation of our results, we will take recourse to the two-loop renormalization group equations [86] for enhanced precision and rigor. However, we will soon see that, qualitatively the evolution trajectories at the one- and two-loop levels are very similar in our case and that the quantitative differences are rather minor, at least at energy scales well below the perturbative limits of couplings. Keeping this in view, we start by presenting the one-loop RGEs so that we can fall back on them to provide intuitive explanations of the trajectories. At the same time, the detailed results presented in the next subsection are all based on two-loop equations, although we take the liberty of explaining them in terms of one-loop equations, empowered by reasons summarized above.
First we present the one-loop RGEs for the gauge couplings. They form a stand-alone set, at one loop, as we can see from Equation 5.1, and therefore they remain unchanged for different types of 2HDMs. We mention here that in writing Equation 5.1, GUT normalization has not been used.

(5.1)

Next we focus on the RGE of the Yukawa couplings in Type-X 2HDM. The corresponding equations are as follows. Here g and Y in the superscripts, respectively, denote gauge and Yukawa interactions, contributing to the running of the Yukawa couplings(taken here as real).

The resulting beta-function will be the sum of the gauge and Yukawa components.

Y = Yg + YY

(5.3)

The Yukawa and gauge contributions show similar behavior for Yt and Yb. It is clear from Equations. 5.2 that the gauge contribution decreases with energy whereas the Yukawa part

go up at higher energy. However, the terms involving the strong coupling constant g3 dominates over the other terms and therefore the top and bottom Yukawa couplings mono-

tonically decrease with energy. The  -Yukawa coupling on the other hand, unaffected by

the strong interaction, remains almost constant. This behavior can be seen from Figure 15.

The relevant equations for the running of quartic couplings are given below. Here, the

superscripts b and Y denote, respectively, bosonic(gauge couplings and quartic couplings)

and Yukawa interactions, contributing to the running of  s.

(5.5)

One should note, since the Yukawa couplings depend on the specific kinds of 2HDM, it is obvious that their evolution as well as those of the quartic couplings are model-dependent. This is obvious from Equations. 5.2 and 5.4.

5.2 Coupling trajectories and inference drawn from them

In this subsection, the running of various couplings will be illustrated in terms of a few

chosen benchmark points. A brief justification for choosing those will be given shortly.

Based on the discussion in the preceding subsection, we will present here the full two-

loop results for our benchmark points(BP). Our chosen benchmarks are consistent with

theoretical as well as experimental constraints.

We have seen that, in Scenario 1, the requirement of low branching fraction of SM-like

Higgs

to

two

pseudoscalars

along

with

other

constraints

leads

us

to

mA

>

mh 2

in

the

RS

region. However, it is possible to get allowed points in the whole range of mA in the WS

regime. Keeping this in mind, we choose three benchmarks BP1, BP2 and BP3 for scenario

1.

BP1 corresponds to WS region with mA >

mh 2

.

BP2 corresponds to WS region and

mA

<

mh 2

.

For

BP3,

an enhancement factor in the large tan  region. As for this parameter space, we have

like to mention here that all the benchmarks satisfy the limit on yh as well as yhV from the alignment condition [17, 18].

In Figure 12, we can see the two-loop RG running of quartic couplings for BP1, BP2 and BP3. For all these benchmarks tree level unitarity decides the value of cUuVt-off which is denoted by the end scale in all figures, whereas stability and perturbativity can be sat-

isfied even after that cut-off scale. It is clear from the running that the larger the value

for any quatic coupling at the electroweak scale, the quicker it breaks the unitarity cri-

teria. For both BP1 and BP2, 3 is becomes largest among the quartic couplings at the

breakdown scale, whereas in BP3 1 plays this role. Also from Figure 12(c) it is clear that

starting from nearly same value, 1 can increase faster than 3 as energy increases. On the

other hand, the runnings of other 's show a flat nature compared to 1 and 3. As we do not allow hard Z2-breaking, 6 and 7 do not change with energy and are fixed at zero.

In explicit terms, the RG equations for 6 and 7, always carry the terms proportional to

these

and

therefore

the

relation

remains

valid

throughout

.

A complementary picture is noticed in Scenario 2. Here the requirement of low branch-

ing fraction of SM-like Higgs to a pair of pseudoscalars along with other constraints pushes

mA >

mH 2

in the WS region.

On the other hand, in the RS case, it is possible to get a

low BR(hSM  AA) in the entire range of mA. To examine Scenario 2 on a case by case

basis, we choose three benchmarks BP4, BP5, BP6. BP4 corresponds to RS region with

mA

mH 2

,

BP5

corresponds

to

RS

region

with

mA

<

mH 2

.

We

consider

WS region with

mH 2

in BP6.

The benchmarks for Scenario 2 are listed in Table 2.

few

points

in

the

WS

region,

with

mA

the resonant region with severe fine-tuning, we do not consider this region further in our

analysis.

Our BP4 and BP6 have negative sin( - ) and large tan , where BP5 has positive

sin( - ) and comparatively small tan . Here too, in the alignment limit, 2 is governed

by the 125-GeV Higgs mass and therefore for all the benchmarks it gets similar values as

scenario 1. In this case, 3 is comparatively smaller than the previous case due to smaller mass gap between mH and mh, whereas 1 can get somewhat enhanced contribution from m212 term at large tan . On the other hand, 4 and 5 are opposite in sign, similar to the previous scenario.
Having thus identified our benchmark points, we further note that all the six aforesaid
benchmark points fall in the yellowish interior region of Figure 5. Therefore our analyses
based on them are legitimate, both with the older data and on taking the very recent
results into account, as far as constraints from gµ - 2 is concerned. For our subsequent analysis on UV-completion, we shall use the combined data of gµ - 2 as the constraining factor on the parameter space.
In Figure 13, we display two-loop RG running of quatic couplings for BP4, BP5 and BP6. We can see that for all the three benchmarks cUuVt-off is again decided by tree level unitarity. For BP4 and BP6, comparatively smaller values of  s at the electroweak scale ensure tree-level unitarity as well as perturbativity and stability upto very high scale( 1019
GeV). We can see that in general it is easier to achieve UV-completion for scenario 2 than 1.

We have noticed in Figures 12 and 13 that for all the  s, the negative contribution to the running of  s comes from the combination (3g12 + 9g22) and terms involving Yukawa couplings. If to this we couple the information that g2 falls at higher energies, while g1 has at best marginal rise and the Yukawa couplings remain more or less constant, one finally has all quartic couplings rising with energy in this scenario. This feature which is generic to 2HDMs is due to the proliferation of bosonic degrees of freedom in the RG equations. Thus the stronger constraint almost invariably comes from perturbative unitarity.
The quartic coupling 2 shows a unique behavior. For some benchmarks (namely BP1 and BP2) it shows the usual monotonically increasing trend. But for the other BPs (BP3 to BP6) it decreases initially and then increases. The reason behind this behavior is the following: in case of BP1 and BP2 the magnitude of 3, 4 and 5 are much larger compared to the rest of the benchmarks. The terms proportional to 3, 4 and 5 control the positive contribution to the beta function for 2. Therefore depending on their values the cancellation between the positive and negative terms can sometimes, take place. However, here the dominant negative contribution comes from terms involving Yukawa couplings and their strengths drop at higher energies. Thus 2 starts to increase at high energies for all the benchmarks. One can also note that this behavior is correlated to the mass difference between the two neutral scalars h and H as the coupling 3 is proportional to this mass difference. It is evident from Table 1 that in case of BP1 and BP2, this mass difference is much larger. Consequently, the beta function for 2 takes a positive value in these cases at all energies.
On the other hand, in case of BP3, we see that 1 and 3 start from similar low energy values, but 1 tends to grow faster. As in this case 1, 3 > 2, 4, the bosonic contribution is larger in case of 1 compared to 3. The Yukawa contributions drop with energy whereas the bosonic contribution keeps growing. Therefore, beyond a certain energy ( 1010 GeV), 1 becomes larger than 3.
Another interesting feature can be observed if we compare the running of 4 and 5 in case of BP1 and BP2. In these two cases, at the EW scale, |4|  |5| as can be seen from Table 1. It can be checked from Equation 5.4 that in this limit, the beta functions for 4 and 5 become almost equal to each other in magnitude and opposite in sign. This behavior is clearly seen in Figure 12.
A comparison has been made between one-loop and two-loop RG running of quartic couplings in Figure 14, for a representative benchmark (BP3). We have seen that in case of one-loop RG evolution unitarity breaks down faster than the two-loop case. However, the breaking scale is of the order of 1013 GeV in both cases. The values of quartic couplings, too, are very similar at high scales. Nonetheless, it is seen that the two-loop contribution helps us achieve somewhat higher UV cut-off scales.
The running of the gauge and Yukawa couplings are shown in case of BP3 and BP4 in Figure 15. The qualitative nature of the running will be same for all the benchmarks. The variation in the top- and bottom-Yukawa couplings are significant, as can be seen through the logarithmic plots, since they are affected by strong interaction, unlike what happens to the  -Yukawa. The  -Yukawa interaction overrides even the top-Yukawa coupling at high

scales, by virtue of the fact that we are considering benchmark points with large tan . Some remarks are in order on the evolution of the gauge couplings, especially in the
context of possible embedding of the Type-X 2HDM in a Grand Unified Theory (GUT). As far as the gauge interactions are concerned, the evolution patterns are largely similar to the SM trajectories, if one remembers that GUT normalization has not been used for the U (1) gauge coupling. It should also be noted that one loses perturbative unitarity of quartic couplings at around 1013 GeV for BP3, and even the two-loop RGEs cease to be trustworthy beyond that. So long as perturbativity is held to be sacrosanct, one therefore needs the intervention of new physics within approximately 1013 GeV in this case, and that intervening physics should have a role in ensuring grand unification, if at all. For BP4, on the other hand, no such requirement arises since the interactions are perturbative all the way to the Planck scale. However, the merger of the three kinds of gauge interaction at the GUT scale still requires some additional threshold effects, as much as they do in the standard model, a requirement eminently fulfilled, for example, by supersymmetry broken at the TeV-scale.
6 Allowed regions with various cut-off scales
After discussing the RG-evolutions of all the relevant couplings in the model, we proceed to scan the model parameter space and look for points which satisfy all the theoretical constraints, namely perturbativity, unitarity and vacuum stability upto cut-off scale cUuVt-off ( 104, 108, 1016, 1019 GeV). To maintain consistency in the discussion we divide our analysis in four previously considered scenarios namely,
1) Case 1: Scenario 1 with WS Yukawa, 2) Case 2: Scenario 1 with RS Yukawa, 3) Case 3: Scenario 2 with WS Yukawa, 4) Case 4: Scenario 2 with RS Yukawa.
We will identify the allowed parameter spaces for each of these cases in two-dimensional planes of relevant physical model parameters as well as the quartic couplings  s. In all the plots in Figure 16-27 the blue, green, red and yellow points represent the regions valid upto 104, 108, 1016, 1019 GeV respectively.
· Case 1:
In Figure 16(a), the two black lines represent the upper and lower bounds from gµ - 2 anomaly at 3. Figure 16(b) shows the allowed parameter space which satisfy the observed gµ - 2 as well as the strong upper limit from Br(hSM  AA). It is clear from this plot that high-scale validity upto the Planck scale demands tan  < 30. At the electroweak scale we have seen that large tan  regions are disfavored from the requirement of perturbative unitarity, since large tan  eventually results in large  s. For high-scale validity,  s need to be small at electroweak scale. Naturally, relatively small values of tan  are favored from the stand-point of high-scale validity. On the other hand, the observed gµ - 2 prefers

is clear from Figure 16(b). In the same figure, we see a sharp discontinuity in the allowed

is strongly restricted by the limit BR(hSM  AA) < 4%. This constraint is particularly

severe for large tan , a feature we have already seen in Section 4.

In Figures 17(a), (b) and (c), we show the high-scale validity in the (mH - tan ),

(sin( - ) - tan ) and (mH - mH±) planes respectively. We can see that the highscale validity demands smaller mH . The major reason behind this is the following. As 3

increases with mH in this region (see Equation 4.3), the requirement of small 3 at the

electroweak scale (which is necessary for high-scale validity) pushes us towards small mH

values. One more feature from the figure is that, when tan  < 50 there is a discontinuity

in the allowed points. The reason behind this is the following. The parameter space with

tan

mA

albeit

the

to

.

From

Figure

17(c),

we

can

see

that

the

high-

scale validity puts a strong upper bound on mH , which also follows from our understanding

of the perturbativity and unitarity condition at the electroweak scale. The degeneracy

between mH and mH± mass naturally pushes the charged scalar mass to smaller values, at the high scales which is evident from the Figure 17(c).

Let us now discuss the high-scale validity in the planes spanned by the quartic cou-

plings, as they play the key role in this regard. In Figure 18(a), we can see that 1 controls

the high-scale behavior much more than 2. This happens because 2 at the electroweak

scale is solely determined by the 125-GeV Higgs mass and varies only slightly with energy,

a behavior we have already seen. With the variation in scale from 104 GeV to 1019 GeV,

the allowed range of 2 varies only slightly around its electroweak value. On the contrary, allowed range for 1 varies from 3 to 0.5 with the same variation in scale. In Figure 18(b), we have shown the region allowed after the constraints from gµ - 2 and BR(hSM  AA) are applied. We have seen from our earlier discussions that gµ - 2 favors large tan  while the upper limit on BR(hSM  AA) favors low tan . 2 is inversely proportional to tan  in the alignment region. Therefore higher values of 2 are disfavored by the observed gµ - 2 data, while the lower 2 gets constrained from the BR(hSM  AA).
In Figure 18(c), we demonstrate regions with different levels of high-scale validity in the parameter space spanned by 1 and 3. Their high-scale behavior appears to be strongly correlated with each other and the allowed range in the 1-3 plane shows elliptic contours. Figure 18(d) shows the allowed region after the imposition of gµ - 2 and BR(hSM  AA) constraints. We can see that these two constraints do not affect these couplings directly, but only reduces the density of points uniformly, depending on the other quartic couplings.
In Figure 18(e), we plot the high-scale validity in the 4 - 5 plane. We have seen

in our earlier discussion that the mass degeneracy between mH and mH± implies 4  -5. As the perturbative unitarity condition favors this mass degeneracy, this correlation between 4 and 5 is also favored for high-scale validity. The gµ - 2 and BR(hSM  AA) constraints result in only uniform reduction of allowed points, the nature of the allowed region remaining unaltered (see Figure 18(f)).
It is clear from the discussion in the plane of quatic couplings that, the requirement of validity of the theory upto higher scales, pushes the quartic couplings to smaller values.

In Figure 19, we show the high-scale validity in mA - tan  plane in the right-sign

region of Scenario 1. Here the nature of high-scale validity is same as case 1 and for the

same reason. The black line in the Figure 19(a) denotes the lower limit coming from the

In Figure 20(a), (b) and (c) we show the high-scale validity in the (mH - tan ),

(R(-) - tan ) and (mH - mH±) planes respectively, after imposing the gµ - 2 constraints

and the upper limit from BR(hSM  AA). Here too, we observe similar behavior as case

1 and the same discussion follows. We note here that, tan  < 50 is completely disfavored

in this case unlike case 1. The reason behind this is in case 2, we do not have a region

We report next on the high-scale validity in the RS region of Scenario 1 in the parameter

space spanned by the quartic couplings. In Figure 21(a)-(f), we see similar features as in

case 1. However, in this case, large values of 3 become disfavored even at the electroweak

scale as can be seen from Figure 21(c) and (d), since in the RS case a stronger upper bound

is imposed on the mH± and mH , compared to WS case, in the pseudoscalar mass range

of our interest. In Figure 21(e) and (f), we see, in this case, the lower masses of mH and mH± restrict the upper limits on 4 and 5 to lower values compared to the WS case.
· Case 3:

We now proceed to scenario 2 (ie. mH = 125 GeV), in the WS region. In Scenario 2,

the charged scalar and the non-standard CP-even scalar masses are kept at a lower range

compared to Scenario 1. In Figure 22, we show the the high-scale validity in the mA -tan 

plane. Like the previous cases, here too, the tension between the high-scale validity and the

observed gµ - 2 continues.

respectively. As a low mass range for the non-standard CP-even scalar (h) is considered

in this case, the entire mass range is valid upto very high scales. However, the gµ - 2 data

whereas

is

from

the upper limit on BR(hSM  AA), therefore we see no point in the range tan  < 50 in

Figure 23(a) and (b).

The behavior of the quartic couplings in the context of high-scale validity is similar

to the previous cases considered, as we can see from Figure 24(a)-(f). The apparently

stronger upper limit on 3 in Figure 24(c) and (d) follows from the fact that the CPeven non-standard scalar mass (mh) is much lower in Scenario 2, compared to Scenario 1, irrespective of WS and RS. In Figure 24(e) and (f), we see a different behavior compared

to scenario 1. The correlation between 4 and 5 here is not very clear. The reason

again being, in Scenario 2, we are confined within small range for mh and therefore the degeneracy, which is responsible for the correlation between 4 and 5, is not very apparent in this case. As the non-standard scalar masses are already small, almost the entire region

considered is allowed upto a very high scale(1019 GeV).

· Case 4:

Now we will focus on the RS region of scenario 2 ie. mH = 125 GeV. Here too, the charged

Higgs and the non-standard CP-even scalar masses are kept on the lower side. In Figure 25,

similar behavior as the previous cases is observed. One may note, similar to case 1, here

In Figure 26(a), (b) and (c), we show the allowed parameter space in the plane spanned

by (mh - tan ), (sin( - ) - tan ) and (mh - mH±) plane respectively. Due to low mass range of the non-standard scalars, the entire mass range considered is valid upto very high

scales just like in case 3. The strip below tan  < 50 in Figure 26(a) and (b) corresponds to

points

with

that

as

in case 1.

Next we show the region of parameter space in the plane of the quartic couplings, in

Figure 27(a)-(f). The qualitative nature of the allowed regions are very similar to case 3,

precisely because of low non-standard scalar masses in both cases.

The most salient points of the discussion in the current section can be summarized as

follows:

· Irrespective of the specific case at hand, the smaller the quartic couplings are at the electroweak scale, the higher is the scale of validity of a theory.
· The requirement of small quartic couplings naturally implies moderate tan  and/or non-standard scalar masses on the lower side.
· The observed gµ - 2 data favor large tan , creating a tension with high-scale validity.
· 1(also 3, although in a correlated manner with 1) and 5(4 shows a strong correlation with it), mainly control the high-scale behavior and remain practically unaffected by the constraints such as gµ - 2 or the BR(hSM  AA).

· 2 on the other hand, does not play a significant role in the high-scale validity, but remains heavily constrained from gµ - 2 and BR(hSM  AA).
· High-scale validity in general demands degeneracy between the non-standard scalar masses as well as their closeness to the 125-GeV Higgs mass.
· In case 2, ie. when the lighter CP-even scalar is SM-like in the right-sign region, the requirement of perturbative unitarity at the elctroweak scale, already favors lower non-standard scalar masses and consequently lower quartic couplings, facilitating high-scale validity.
· In Scenario 2 (both cases 3 and 4), the non-standard scalar masses are on the lower side, as compared to Scenario 1. Therefore, here too, a major portion of the parameter space remains valid upto Planck scale.
· Case 1 is least favored among the four cases considered, when high-scale validity is demanded.
7 Conclusion
We have explored the high-scale validity of Type-X 2HDM, particularly in regions of the parameter space answering to a low-mass neutral CP-odd spinless particle. Such a pseudoscalar is not only consistent with all experimental limits so far but can also help in explaining the observed discrepancy in gµ - 2. The high-scale validity of the regions of the parameter space of this model, where the above features of special interest are noticed, has been studied here.
We have identified the regions in the parameter space, which are helpful in explaining (gµ - 2) including the most recent results. Other theoretical and experimental constraints, starting from low-scale perturbative unitarity, vacuum stability etc., and all the way to the most recent LHC limits, have been used to filter out the surviving parameter regions. The two-loop running of various couplings in such regions upto high scales has been studied thereafter, thus identifying regions where perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability are satisfied upto various high scales, ranging from 104 GeV to the Planck scale. Different benchmark points have been used, including both situations where the 125-GeV state is either the lighter or the heavier neutral CP-even scalar. Scenarios with both right-and wrong-sign Yukawa couplings have also scanned across the parameter space.
For regions in the parameter space having cut-off scales on the lower side, the aspiration for perturbative unification of the three SM gauge couplings is found to necessitate UV completion of Type-X 2HDM below the GUT scale. For regions with perturbative validity inching up to the Planck scale, on the other hand, the requirements for gauge coupling unification turn out to be similar to what they are for the standard model electroweak symmetry breaking sector. All this bears ample testimony to the Type-X 2HDM being a candidate theory that explains the observed value of gµ - 2, keeping open a rich set of UV completion possibilities.
