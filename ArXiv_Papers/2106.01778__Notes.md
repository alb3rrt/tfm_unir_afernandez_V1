## Abstract

We propose the single-step fabrication of (3+1)D graded-index (GRIN) optical elements by introducing the light exposure as the additional dimension. Following this method, we demonstrate two different optical devices: Volume holograms that are superimposed using angular and peristrophic multiplexing and optical waveguides with a well-defined refractive index profile. In the latter, we precisely control the propagating modes via tuning the 3D-printed waveguide parameters and report step-index and graded-index core-cladding transitions.
