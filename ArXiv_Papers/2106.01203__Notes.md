## Abstract

] which requires in addition a condition $\forall k\ge1,\rm{det}(M_k)<-\varepsilon$ for some $\varepsilon>0.$ Such a condition excludes a large class of mean matrices. As byproducts, we also get some results on asymptotics of products of nonhomogeneous matrices which have their own interests.
