## Abstract

Concept of p-frame with the help of b-linear functional in the case of n-Banach space is being presented and its few properties, one of them, Cartesian product of two p-frames again becomes a p-frame, have been discussed. Finally, the perturbation results and the stability of p-frame in n-Banach space with respect to b-linear functional are being studied.
