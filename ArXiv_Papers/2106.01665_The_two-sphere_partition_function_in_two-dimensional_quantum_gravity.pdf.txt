Abstract We study the Euclidean path integral of two-dimensional quantum gravity with positive cosmological constant coupled to conformal matter with large and positive central charge. The problem is considered in a semiclassical expansion about a round two-sphere saddle. We work in the Weyl gauge whereby the computation reduces to that for a (timelike) Liouville theory. We present results up to two-loops, including a discussion of contributions stemming from the gauge fixing procedure. We exhibit cancelations of ultraviolet divergences and provide a path integral computation of the central charge for timelike Liouville theory. Combining our analysis with insights from the DOZZ formula we are led to a proposal for an all orders result for the two-dimensional gravitational partition function on the two-sphere.

1 Introduction
In this work we explore theories of two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to conformal matter. Our approach rhymes with that of [1, 2, 3] in that we will rely heavily on the existence of a semiclassical limit. Although gravity in two-dimensions is a rather simple theory, when coupled to conformal matter it exhibits various features in common with a theory of gravity in a fourdimensional world. Particularly, the theory can have real semiclassical saddle point solutions [4], and it moreoever exhibits a direct analogue of the unbounded conformal mode rendering the Euclidean gravitation action an infamously subtle affair. The advantage of the two-dimensional approach, as has been explored and emphasised often in the past and also more recently, is the remarkable control one has over the gravitational path integral [5, 6, 7].
The specific class of gravitational theories we consider are ones equipped with a positive cosmological constant . We will couple these theories to two-dimensional conformal matter endowed

1

with a large and positive central charge cm, thereby introducing a large number of field theoretic degrees of freedom. Examples of two-dimensional conformal field theories with cm  1 include tensor product theories, and holographic CFTs.1 As we shall soon see, the large value of cm is crucially tied to the existence of a semiclassical picture. The technical object we will focus on will be the gravitational path integral over the matter and gravitational fields on an S2 topology. We will offer a physical motivation for this shortly. The main goal of our work is to provide the systematics for a perturbative quantum loop expansion about the round two-sphere saddle in the large cm limit. We apply this to compute the saddle point approximation and the first few orders in the quantum loop expansion of the two-sphere partition function of interest. We work in the Weyl gauge whereby the gravitational path integral takes the form of a (timelike) Liouville theory [6, 7]. From this perspective, our approach offers a path integral perspective for the semiclassical expansion of the timelike DOZZ formula proposed and explored in [3, 9, 10, 11, 12].
Before embarking on our analysis we find it instructive to provide a physical derivation and motivation for the saddle point solutions of the gravitational theories under consideration.

Two-dimensional gravity coupled to conformal matter

The theory we will focus on consists of a two-dimensional matter CFT of central charge cm coupled to two-dimensional gravity. The Euclidean path integral of interest is given by


Zgrav[] = eh
h=0

[Dgij ] e- h d2xg × ZC(hF)T[gij ] ,

(1.1)

where we take  > 0, h is the Euler character of the genus h surface h, and ZC(hF)T[gij ] is the matter CFT partition function. The positivity of  suppresses large area configurations. Unless otherwise stated we will, for the most part, restrict our attention to S2 topology.
Although the pure gravity theory has no classical solutions in two-dimensions due to the topo-
logical nature of the Einstein term, upon coupling to a matter theory the effective gravitational action including the contribution from ZC(hF)T[gij] does [4]. If we further require that the saddle be semiclassical, we must additionally take the central charge cm to be large. Exploiting that twodimensional gravity is invariant under the two-dimensional diffeomorphism group we can fix the
metric, at least within a small neighbourhood, to the Weyl gauge

ds2 = e2(x)g~ij dxidxj .

(1.2)

Here (x) is a real valued function encoding the Weyl factor of the physical metric. For vanishing genus we can further choose g~ij as the round metric on S2 with area 4, namely

ds~2 = g~ij dxidxj = d2 + sin2 d2 ,

(1.3)

1In this case, coupling to two-dimensional quantum gravity can be viewed as rendering the boundary metric of the dual AdS3 geometry dynamical [8].

with   (0, ) and    + 2. On an S2 topology, and more specifically on an S2 geometry, the

form of ZC(0F)T[gij] is known [5, 13]. Up to local ultraviolet divergences that can be absorbed into the bare gravitational couplings  and  the form of ZC(0F)T[gij] is fixed by the conformal anomaly.

Concretely, for genus zero

ZC(0F)T[gij ] = N e-Sanomaly[] ,

(1.4)

where N is a normalisation constant, and Sanomaly[] is2

(1.6)

Consequently, in the semiclassical limit, the effective action governing the Weyl mode is given by

Seff

d2x g~e2 .

(1.7)

Interestingly, much like what happens for the conformal mode in higher dimensional Euclidean gravity, Seff has a wrong sign kinetic term for . Being semiclassical, Seff ignores contributions from the bc-ghost sector as well as the gravitational path integration measure. The reason is that these contributions, though present, will be subleading at large cm. They will constitute much of what follows in the later sections.
The saddle point equations stemming from (1.7) admit a constant  saddle with

(1.8)

The saddle point solution corresponds to a round two-sphere of area  = cm/6. To leading order, the vanishing genus expression reads:

(1.9)

where the constant is  independent, but will generally depend on cm. For   1, higher genus

corrections to (1.1) are exponentially small as compared to the genus zero contribution. Thus,

two-dimensional gravity coupled to a CFT with large positive central charge admits a classical

(Euclidean) dS2 solution

(1.10)

with   (0, ) and    + 2, which is the round two-sphere. Upon Lorentzian continuation

(1.11)

Although the action is non-local, the degree of non-locality seems permissible in the context of two-dimensional gravity. Here it stems from integrating out the massless matter content of the two-dimensional conformal field theory.

with t  R. This is the static patch of dS2 with the de Sitter horizon residing at  = 0 and  = . Intuitively, the physical reason the matter CFT can support a positive curvature space with
positive gravitational vacuum energy density  is due to the negative static patch energy Es.p. = -cm/12 (see for instance section 7 of [14]) associated to a matter CFT quantised on a fixed dS2 background with de Sitter length  (corresponding to a round two-sphere of area dS = 42 upon Wick rotating to Euclidean signature). General relativity on a compact spatial slice with no boundaries enforces that the total energy vanishes, leading to the expression

(1.12)

which is solved by  = cm/(24), precisely corresponding to the saddle (1.8). According to Gibbons and Hawking [15, 16] the gravitational path integral log Zgrav[] in (1.1)
computes the entropy of the dS2 horizon. What is missing as compared to higher-dimensions is a term related to the area in Planck units, since there is no Planck length (or horizon area) in two-

dimensions. Instead, the term 2 in (1.1), stemming from the two-dimensional Einstein term, might

be viewed as the lower-dimensional analogue of the tree-level horizon entropy. The logarithmic term

(1.9) is the entanglement entropy of the CFT degrees of freedom across the dS2 horizon [17, 18].

Indeed, for a CFT on the static patch of dS2 with de Sitter length  the entanglement entropy across

the dS2 horizon is [19]

(1.13)

where the constant is dS independent while generally depending on cm. It should be clear then how to compare (1.13) with the logarithmic term in (1.9).

Outline
In the following sections we will explore the semiclassical expansion about the saddle (1.8) being more precise about the subleading corrections. We will discuss more detailed properties of Zgrav[] (1.1) at the quantum level perturbatively near the classical saddle. Corrections away from the standard CFT expression (1.13) are due to the interaction with gravity. In this sense, the analysis provides us a window into the effects of gravity on entanglement entropy in two-dimensions. In section 2 we discuss how to fix the Weyl gauge, including a careful treatment of the residual P SL(2, C) gauge symmetries of Zg(0ra)v[]. In section 3 we compute various perturbation corrections to Zg(0ra)v[], culminating in the two-loop expression (3.24). In section 4 we compare our results to a prediction of the exact sphere partition function stemming from an analytic continuation (4.8) of the DOZZ formula. We conclude with an outlook in section 5. The appendices provide important details leading to the results presented in the main text.

2 The Weyl gauge
In order to proceed, we will consider the problem in the Weyl gauge (1.2). In doing so, we employ a hypothesis of Distler-Kawai [6] and David [7] that fixes the path-integration measure over the Weyl mode . In this section, we consider the problem on a genus zero surface and provide a proper treatment of the residual gauge freedom.

2.1 Path integral in the Weyl gauge & timelike Liouville.
In complex coordinates the two-dimensional metric in the Weyl gauge can be expressed as

ds2 = e2b(z,z¯)ds~2 ,

(2.1)

where our choice of fiducial metric takes the Fubini-Study form

ds~2

=

4dzdz¯ (1 + zz¯)2

,

(2.2)

with area 4. We have included the parameter b for future convenience. It will also be convenient to work with spherical coordinates

z

=

ei

tan

,

such that the fiducial metric is given by

z¯ =

e-i

tan

 2

,

(2.3)

ds~2 =  d2 + sin2 d2 ,

(2.4)

with   (0, ) and    + 2, capturing the two-sphere with area 4. In order to properly fix the Weyl gauge (2.1) we must introduce Fadeev-Popov bc-ghost fields.
Upon integrating out the matter and bc-ghost fields, our resulting gravitational path integral on a genus zero surface is given by

(2.5)

We have collected all dependence on the Weyl mode , including the contributions from the confor-
mal anomalies of the matter and bc-ghost theories, into a single action which we have called SL[]. We have also used the general expression (1.13) to extract the  dependence from the matter CFT and bc-ghost theory [13], where the constant A is ZC(0F)T[g~ij] × Zb(c0)[g~ij] with  = 1.
According to the hypothesis of Distler-Kawai [6] and David [7], this action is given by the
Liouville action [5]

with [D] being the standard flat measure on the space of fields . Moreover, Q = b + 1/b and the

Liouville central charge is cL = 1 + 6Q2. Consistency of the theory, viewed as a theory of gravity

coupled to conformal matter, requires cL - 26 + cm = 0. In terms of the matter central charge,

Q=

25 - cm 6

,





b = 25 - cm- 1 - cm ,

26

(2.7)

where the positive root for Q is a choice we can make given the redundancy Q  -Q , b  -b, and   -. On the other hand, b is chosen to be the solution admitting a semiclassical limit at large cm. It would be interesting to explore the other sign of b also.
For cm > 25, Q and b are pure imaginary. To render the action real, we will consider the field  to live on a purely imaginary contour. The resulting theory is known as timelike Liouville theory [5]. It is convenient to parameterise this theory as follows:

StL[]

=

1 4

d2x g~ -g~ij ij  - qR~ + 4e2 ,

(2.8)

where  = ib, q = -iQ (or similarly  = -ib and q = iQ) and  has been continued to reside along the real axis. The reality properties of StL more closely resemble those of the effective action (1.7) obtained from our gravitational considerations. The cost of having a real action is a kinetic term which is unbounded from below. This is the two-dimensional analogue of the unbounded conformal mode in higher-dimensional theories of Euclidean gravity.
In section 3 we study the semiclassical expansion of StL. But before doing so, we must first discuss the residual gauge symmetries that remain upon fixing the Weyl gauge.

2.2 Residual gauge symmetries & further gauge fixing.
On a genus zero surface (2.1) does not fully fix the gauge. For instance, the transformation

2b(z, z¯)  2b(z, z¯) - (z, z¯) , g~ij(z, z¯)  e(z,z¯)g~ij(z, z¯) ,

(2.9)

is a redundancy of the parametrisation. As such, the resulting theory must be invariant under the above redundancy. Locally, conformal Killing vectors of g~ij are given by holomorphic maps

z  f (z) , z¯  f (z) .

(2.10)

The above maps do not affect the form of the Weyl gauge (2.1) since they can be reabsorbed in a shift of (z, z¯). Of the space of holomorphic maps, we must select the subset of (2.10) which are normalisable under the norm on the space of diffeomorphisms i(z, z¯) [1, 5]

ds2 = dzdz¯ggij ij .

(2.11)

6

This leaves a P SL(2, C) subgroup of normalisable residual diffeomorphisms.Explicitly, these are the

maps

f (z)

=

az + b cz + d

,

ad - bc = 1 ,

(2.12)

with a, b, c, and d in C, and their anti-holomorphic counterpart f (z). At the infinitesimal level, the transformations are given by linearly expanding near the identity a = d = 1 and c = b = 0:

z  z + b + (a - d) z - c z2 ,

(2.13)

where we must further impose a = -d to preserve ad - bc = 1 to linear order. The maximally compact SO(3) group of P SL(2, C) is given by restricting

b¯b + dd¯ = 1 , a¯b + cd¯ = 0 , aa¯ + cc¯ = 1 .

(2.14)

We can parameterise this by b = sin ei , d = cos ei , a = eid¯ , c = -e-i¯b ,

(2.15)

with   (0, 2),   (0, 2), and   (0, /2). Recalling that ad - bc = 1 sets  = 0 such that we are left with three real parameters {, , } which are the Hopf coordinates of the SO(3) group manifold with geometry given by the round S3

ds2 = d2 + d2 sin2  + d2 cos2  .

(2.16)

The identity is  =  = 0 such that the infinitesimal transformations (2.13) reduce to b = -c¯ = ei , d = -a = i .

(2.17)

The remaining three deformations in (2.13) generate the remaining P SL(2, C) transformations. The presence of these residual transformations justifies why we must divide the partition function
(2.5) by the volume of P SL(2, C) [20]

volP SL(2,C) = 2 d2a d2b d2c d2 d ×  (ad - bc - 1) .
C4

(2.18)

This volume must be treated with care as it is infinite. The residual P SL(2, C) symmetry acts non-trivially on the Liouville field (z, z¯). We can study this in the semiclassical limit where   1/q  1. For the sake of simplicity, we introduce (z, z¯) satisfying

ds~2

=

4dzdz¯ (1 + zz¯)2



e2(z,z¯)dzdz¯

.

(2.19)

It follows that

R~ = -8 × e-2(z,z¯)zz¯(z, z¯) ,

(2.20)

7

and the Liouville action (2.6) reads

StL[]

=

1 4

dzdz¯ 2 zz~ - q g~R~ + 4 g~e2 .

(2.21)

As shown in appendix B, it is relatively straightforward to check that in the semiclassical limit the transformation

(2.22)

leaves StL invariant.3 Given the invariance of StL, and assuming it persists at the quantum level, the path-integral over the Liouville field  will produce a term proportional to the volume P SL(2, C).

Thus, volP SL(2,C) appears in both the numerator and denominator of the gravitational path integral (2.5) in the Weyl gauge.

To fix this we must resort to further gauge-fixing. We can expand the Liouville field in a complete

basis of real spherical harmonics

() = lmYlm() ,
l,m

(2.23)

with  a point on the round metric on S2 with unit area, i.e. (2.4) with  = 1, and the lm are real valued. We have normalised the Ylm() as

dYlm()Ylm () = ll mm .

(2.24)

Further conventions and properties for the spherical harmonics are given in appendix A. Under an isometric map   () the Ylm() map to linear combinations of Ylm() with the
same l. This is because for each l, Ylm() with m  [-l, l] furnish irreducible representations of SO(3). As a gauge-fixing condition we follow [6] and impose that 1m = 0 with m = {-1, 0, 1}.4 A different gauge fixing procedure is discussed in [21]. This condition will remain unchanged under the action of the SO(3) subgroup of P SL(2, C), fixing three of the six parameters of P SL(2, C). Infinitesimally, these are given by (2.13) where we must now deform in directions n that are outside of (2.17). A definition of n and the gauge-fixing procedure is given in appendix C. Given the general transformation (2.22), the Fadeev-Popov determinant for the gauge choice 1m = 0 is

FP

=

det

1m n

,

m  {-1, 0, 1} ,

(2.25)

and n ranges over the three non-SO(3) directions of P SL(2, C). SO(3) invariance fixes the form of
3Beyond this limit the classical Liouville action is no longer invariant, rather it is the quantum theory that must be invariant under (2.22).
4One might wonder whether this gauge condition is permissible and whether it suffers from Gribov ambiguities [22]. However, as pointed out in [6], in the semiclassical limit where we study small field fluctuations the issue is tamed. For instance, the sign of the Fadeev-Popov determinant (2.26) remains unchanged in the semiclassical q   limit.

(2.27)

At this stage, all but the SO(3) isometry group of the original two-dimensional diffeomorphisms has been gauge fixed. Since this is a compact group, we can just divide out its volume explicitly. The volume of SO(3), as computed from the measure (2.16), is given by

volSO(3) = 22 .

(2.28)

(3.1)

in a semiclassical expansion about its real saddle. Our large parameter is taken to be 1/, with   0+, such that the remaining parameters are to be understood in terms of a large 1/ expansion. We recall the exact relations

3.1 Semiclassical saddle and small fluctuations

The classical equations of the Liouville action (2.8) are given by

- 2~ 2 = 8e2 - 2 q , 

(3.3)

where -~ 2 is the Laplacian with respect to g~ij. The equations (3.3) admit a constant and real

solution given by

q 4

.

(3.4)

Due to the P SL(2, C) invariance of the Liouville action, in addition to the above solution there is a continuous family of solutions to (3.3) related to (3.4) by P SL(2, C) transformations. Upon fixing the gauge of the residual gauge symmetries (as discussed in section 2.2) we collapse the continuous

9

solution space down to the constant saddle (3.4). As emphasised in [3], in addition to the real saddle point solution, (3.3) also admit complex solutions  + in/ with n  Z. In this section we will focus on the semiclassical expansion about the real saddle point solution.
The saddle point approximation to the path-integral (3.1) leads to

(3.5)

Comparing to (1.9) for  = 1 and recalling (3.2), we see that the two agree to leading order in the semiclassical limit. It is also interesting to note that (3.5) bears some resemblance to the critical exponent type expressions encountered in spacelike Liouville theory [23, 24, 25].
Expanding the Liouville field  =  +  in (2.8) about the saddle (3.4) we find the action governing fluctuations

(3.6)

where we have kept terms up to order 2. Notice that the small correction in the mass is of the same order as the coefficient of the quartic interaction. We are interested in computing the path integral over the fluctuation field 

Zpert[] = [D] × FP ×

(1m) × e-Spert[] ,

m={-1,0,1}

(3.7)

 in a large 1/ expansion. Interestingly, since g~ yields a factor of , the fluctuation action is

independent of  and  to all orders. But it will depend non-trivially on , and it is this dependence

we will proceed to explore. The path integration contour for (3.7) is over real values of the fluctuation

field . As such, the wrong sign kinetic term renders the path integral ill-defined. A natural

proposal, which we pursue here, is to rotate the contour of  to pure imaginary values. This is the

two-dimensional version of the proposal of Gibbons, Hawking, and Perry [26] for dealing with the

unbounded conformal mode in Euclidean gravity. In rotating   -i the kinetic term becomes

bounded, up to a zero mode which is Gaussian unsuppressed. To deal with this we will Wick rotate

it back, as discussed in [27]. As we will soon see, the Wick rotation of the zero mode will produce an

overall phase in ZtL[]. On the other hand, though the continued perturbative theory has several imaginary couplings, we will argue that aside from the overall phase, the corrections are all real.

One final remark is in order, before computing some contributions is in order. From (3.6) it

looks like the fluctuation action is strongly coupled for some modes. This can be seen by expanding

 in spherical harmonics. The three l = 1 harmonics have an almost zero mode at the Gaussian level which is lifted at order  2. Fortunately, these almost zero modes are eliminated by the

gauge-fixing condition for the residual gauge freedom.

3.2 One-loop contribution
The leading contribution beyond the saddle-point approximation stems from the Gaussian fluctuations. The quadratic action, after continuing   -i, is given by

(3.8)

We note that although the kinetic term is positive, the mass-squared of the fluctuation is negative.5 We now expand  in a complete and orthonormal basis of real spherical harmonics, as in (2.23).
In terms of these, the measure of path integration is taken to be

To render the measure local with respect to g~ij we need to introduce an ultraviolet scale uv with units of inverse area. The eigenvalues and degeneracies of the spherical Laplacian -~ 2 on (2.4) are

(3.11)

For the case at hand, the constant mode fluctuation must be treated separately since it leads to an unsuppressed Gaussian. After the dust settles, we find that up to the Gaussian contribution

and Zsaddle[] is defined in (3.5). The contribution of the Gaussian path integral and Fadeev-Popov determinant at the quadratic level leads to the factor Zp(2e)rt[] in (3.12). We now discuss the various pieces in (3.13). The first parenthesis in (3.13) comes from the zero-mode integral, defined by
5It may also be worth noting that the value of the tachyonic mass squared in the strict   0+ limit is -2 (in units of ) which plays a special role in the representation theory of dS2 [28] as it furnishes the discrete series. In fourdimensional de Sitter, the discrete series is associated to gauge fields. In our case  is a piece of the two-dimensional metric, itself a gauge field.

Integrating over the three l = 1 modes, including the -function from the Fadeev-Popov procedure, yields the second parenthesis in (3.13). We must also consider the five l = 2 modes separately, and these yield the third parenthesis in (3.13). The infinite product in (3.13) is divergent, but can be computed in a variety of ways. We consider the heat kernel method [29], which is covariant. Using a heat kernel regularisation scheme (see for example appendix C of [14])

(3.20)

The dependence cL/6 can be recognised to take the standard form (1.13) of a two-dimensional conformal field theory on the two-sphere [13]. This is consistent with the proposal that timelike Liouville theory can be viewed as a two-dimensional conformal field theory [31, 32, 33]. Moreover, we observe that cL - 26 + cm = 0, a necessary condition to avoid any dependence on the redundancy (2.9).

3.3 Two-loop contribution
Beyond the Gaussian approximation, we must consider the contribution from higher loop Feynman diagrams. Given the perturbative action (3.6), it follows that to leading order beyond the Gaussian approximation we must consider the contribution from the cubic and quartic vertex whose couplings go as   and  2 respectively. Given the constraints on specific angular momentum modes, it is convenient to express the computation in the space of spherical harmonics. As described in detail in appendix D, there are three connected diagrams that contribute. These are shown in figure 1. Two of the diagrams, a melonic diagram and a double-tadpole diagram, contain two cubic vertices. The third is a cactus diagram with a single quartic vertex.

Fig. 1: Double-tadpoles, melons and cactus diagrams.

The double-tadpole diagram and the cactus diagram are logarithmically ultraviolet divergent. Nonetheless, due to the specific quartic and cubic couplings stemming from the Liouville action (3.6), the ultraviolet divergences cancel rendering a finite result. The result is

The ratio a1/a0 = -27/20 follows from (2.27), while the constant `const' is defined in (3.19). The ellipses in (3.24) indicate subleading terms in odd powers of  starting at order O(3).

We end this section with some general observations and expectations about ZtL[]:
· Although the perturbative  expansion of ZtL[] stems from a perturbative action (3.6) which becomes complex along the pure imaginary  contour, ZtL[] is pure imaginary to all orders in the small  expansion.

· The Fadeev-Popov determinant FP (2.26) contributes a term at the same order as the twoloop contribution.

· The dependence on  and  in the pre-factor of (3.24) is exact and will receive no further corrections at subleading order.

· The dependence of uv is such that ZtL[] in (3.24) is dimensionless. At small , the choice of uv will affect the O() term in the parenthesis. Adding contributions from the matter and bc-ghost sectors will cancel the  dependence but not the uv dependence.

· There will be no ultraviolet divergences at higher orders in the quantum loop expansion. This is often a property of supersymmetric theories. Here it is due to the specific values of the interaction vertices in the perturbative action (3.6). In particular this indicates that if timelike Liouville theory is indeed a conformal theory, O = e2 is an exactly marginal deformation.

· Conformal primaries of the matter theory with conformal weight (, ¯ ) can be consistently

coupled to the gravitational theory provided they have 

primary of the form O = e2 with  =

It would be interesting to prove these expectations. In the next section we take a different route, and compare to an expression from the two-sphere partition function that is derived from the DOZZ formula [20, 35, 36, 37] for the three-point function applied to three exponential Liouville operators.

4 Sphere-partition function from (timelike) DOZZ

Having established a systematic semiclassical expansion of timelike Liouville theory we can ask how our expressions compare to other methods in the literature. The natural object to compare to is derived from the expectation value of three exponential operators O = e2. Assuming that timelike Liouville theory is conformally invariant at the quantum level [31, 32, 33], as evidenced for example by (3.18), the three-point function

C(, , ) |z1 - z2|2|z1 - z3|2|z2 - z3|2

is fixed up to a coefficient C(, , ). To make contact with the Liouville partition function ZtL[]

in (3.1) we note that

(4.3)

The integral over the three-points diverges logarithmically due to the regions of integration where two of the points collide. As is known from the critical string, these divergences are of the same magnitude as the divergent volume of P SL(2, C) such that the latter can be used to fix the threepoints and avoid performing the integral altogether.
It follows from (3.24) that the small  expansion of C(, , ) about the real saddle (3.4) is given by

4.1 Analytic continuation of spacelike Liouville?
There have been several proposals for C(, , ) in the literature. The proposal of [3, 9, 10] taken at face value leads to a vanishing result -- C(, , ) = 0. Here, instead, we would like to compare our result (4.4) to the analytic continuation of the spacelike Liouville structure constant for the three-point function of Ob = e2b. This is a special case of the DOZZ formula [20, 35, 36, 37] and

where (z)  (z)/(1 - z) is a meromorphic function with poles when z is a non-positive integer

and zeros when z is a non-vanishing positive integer. At least semiclassically, the DOZZ formula

can be computed from the Liouville path integral [3]. To arrive at (4.5), which differs slightly from

the standard expression in the literature, we must take into account some additional normalisation

factors. In the literature the path integral approach to obtaining the DOZZ formula involves first

mapping the spacelike Liouville theory on the sphere to the disk using (2.22). Concretely, upon

transforming the spacelike Liouville action on the round two-sphere (2.2) with  = 1 to the disk

using the field redefinition [3]

a semiclassical comparison with (3.24), which is computed for the theory on the two-sphere, is only possible upon keeping the field-independent constants. Keeping all these terms, the spacelike Liouville action on a disk of radius   1 reads

The resulting expression (4.5) allows [11, 12] for a well defined analytic continuation b  ±i, Q  iq. The two-sphere partition function ZtDLOZZ[], as derived from the DOZZ formula (4.5) analytically continued to C(, , ), can be obtained by integrating C(, , ) three times with respect to , and setting the integration constants to zero.

We further note that we have rescaled both expressions such that the coefficient of the 1/ term in the parenthesis is one.

· The  dependence between the two expressions agrees. In contrast, ZtDLOZZ[] exhibits no uv = s~uv dependence. We interpret this to mean that for ZtDLOZZ[], dimensionful quantities are measured in units of some choice of ultraviolet cutoff scale. Any discrepancy between the
path integral and DOZZ based on choices of uv is encoded in s.
· The DOZZ formula has an overall factor 1 - e2i/2 . We interpret this to mean that ZtDLOZZ[] receives contributions from two saddle point solutions of (3.3). Particularly, the e2i/2 term can be viewed as stemming from a complex saddle  + i/, where  is given by (3.4). Complex saddles were studied in detail in [3], where it was argued that they indeed contribute to the Liouville path integral. It is interesting that ZtDLOZZ[] seems to require only one additional saddle.

· The leading order contribution to the small  expansion multiplying the classical saddle point approximation is 1/ for both expressions. From the perspective of our computation this stems from the O(-3) term in the Fadeev-Popov determinant (2.26). This term was anticipated in [3].

· Both expressions have an overall sign ambiguity, but the real saddle contribution of ZtDLOZZ[] differs from ZtL[] by an overall factor of i. It is worth noting here that the defining recursion relation [37] satisfied by the DOZZ formula is ambiguous up to an overall rescaling, so in principle one could have defined the DOZZ formula with an overall i. From our perspective both this i as well as the overall sign ambiguity are associated to the unsupressed zero mode (3.14).

5 Outlook

Two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to conformal matter with a large cm is arguably the simplest gravitational theory interacting with matter which moreover admits semi-classical de Sitter vacua. (For large and negative cm one also finds semiclassical Euclidean dS2 solutions upon fixing the area [1, 40, 41].) As such, it constitutes a natural playground to test various proposals regarding quantum features for a de Sitter universe. In particular, one may hope for an exact expression of the Gibbons-Hawking path integral (1.1) at least for vanishing genus. The main result of this paper, building on [1, 3], is a concrete procedure to systematically compute this path integral in a semiclassical expansion. We have applied this procedure up to two-loops resulting in the expression (3.24). Combined with insights from the DOZZ formula and its analytic continuation to timelike Liouville theory, and recalling (2.5), we arrive at the following conjecture for the exact genus zero partition function of gravity coupled to a two-dimensional conformal field theory:

We further recall that q = 1/ - , and that  is related to cm through (3.2). In arriving at (5.1) we have multiplied (4.8) by on overall factor of iA, and we are working in units of ~uv.
In the semiclassical limit   0+, the above expression can be interpreted as stemming from
two saddles of , each accompanied by their respective perturbative series:

The perturbative series about each saddle have the same coefficients up to an overall sign. This is because the saddles themselves are structurally similar, both constant and merely differing by an imaginary shift. Normalising c0 = 1, the first few coefficients are given by

(5.3)

The real saddle corresponds to Euclidean dS2 which is the round two-sphere. The contribution from this saddle is pure imaginary due to the overall i, a feature in common with odd-dimensional
gravitational theories on a round sphere saddles [27]. The other saddle is a highly oscillatory complex function. As a result of the complex saddle, Zg(0ra)v[] is itself complex valued for generic  rather than pure imaginary.7 This contrasts its formal definition as a real valued path integral
over the timelike Liouville action (2.8) in an interesting way. For special values of , the reality properties of Zg(0ra)v[] simplify. We find that for n  Z+,

 = 1/n

=

Zg(0ra)v[] = 0 ,

(5.4)

7Given the wildly oscillatory nature of the complex saddle, it is amusing to consider integrating Zg(0ra)v[] against a reasonably smooth distribution of 's to remove it. This might resonate with some ideas expressed in [42, 43, 44, 45, 46].

(5.5)

A purely real Zg(0ra)v[] requires a complex , albeit one whose imaginary part can be made parametrically smaller than its real part. It would be interesting, and potentially resonate with other
ideas in quantum gravity, if the consistency of our theory required  to take discrete values (from a timelike Liouville theory perspective see also [31, 48]). A vanishing Zg(0ra)v[] also follows form the timelike Liouville DOZZ formula proposed in [3], since it vanishes when evaluated for three O = e2 operators. In particular we highlight that Zg(0ra)v[] vanishes in the limit   1- (5.4), followed by   0+. One can view this limit as ending at the bosonic string with the 26 dimensional
(cm = 25 plus cL = 1) flat target space. Our analysis therefore suggests a novel argument for the vanishing of the genus zero partition function of the critical bosonic string.
It is interesting to ask whether the real saddle accompanied by its infinite perturbative series
expansion yields a function with finite radius of convergence. Somewhat remarkably, given that both saddles have precisely the same perturbative coefficients, we can divide (5.1) by (1 - e2i/2)
leading to the expression

The small  expansion of Z~g(0ra)v[] is given by that of the real Euclidean dS2 saddle alone whose perturbative coefficients are cn. It would be interesting to understand from a purely gravitational perspective whether we should include the additional saddle, as suggested from the DOZZ approach.

(5.7)

This can be viewed as an all orders completion of (1.9) in the 1/cm expansion, where we understand the subleading terms as small corrections to the entanglement entropy across the dS2 horizon due to the presence of dynamical gravity [49]. For instance, the first correction to the cm/6 coefficient in (1.9) is -19/6. It would be interesting to test these ideas through other more direct methods [50, 51]. According to the picture of Gibbons and Hawking [15, 16], the additional terms  and f (0)(cm) encode further contributions to the dS2 entropy. Remarkably, an essentially equivalent formula to (5.7) holds for spacelike Liouville theory which is the theory one is led to when considering two-dimensional gravity coupled to a matter conformal field theory with cm < 1.
Finally, we comment on compact higher genus surfaces.8 In even-dimensions the partition function of quantum field theory on a fixed background has a somewhat ambiguous overall normalisation (a discussion can be found in [52]). For the specific case of two dimensions one can absorb the constant by shifting the coefficient  of the Euler character viewed as a local counterterm. On the other hand, it should be emphasised that the detailed structure of f (0)(cm) encodes crucial information
8It is also worth considering manifolds with boundaries such as the disk partition function (see for example [44, 53, 54, 55]).

about the local field theoretic structure of the original theory. Further to this, the contribution from higher genus corrections renders the normalisation less ambiguous ­ we can only fix the physical coupling  for a single genus at most. For higher genus, based on the reasoning of [6, 7], it is reasonable to anticipate the form

If   1, these contributions will be exponentially small corrections as compared to log Zg(0ra)v[]. It would be very interesting to compute f (h)(cm) in the large cm limit for all h. Unlike the case of genus zero, the higher genus contributions will not be organised in terms of an expansion around a
real saddle point solution. Perhaps this is remedied by fixing the area of the surface [1, 56].

(B.2) (B.3) (B.4) (B.5)

  (z, z¯),   (z, z¯) , f  (f (z), f (z)) , f  (f (z), f (z)) .

(B.6)

For the last term it is quite easy, although importantly this term has to be invariant under (B.2) only in the semiclassical limit. We have

2 dzdz¯ g~e2  dzdz¯e2 f (z)f (z) e2(f -)e2f

21

= df (z)df (z)e2f e2f = 2 dzdz¯ g~e2 .

(B.7)

The first term in the Liouville action (B.5) transforms under (B.2) as

dz dz¯z z¯  dzdz¯f zz¯f + 2q dzdz¯f zz¯ (f - ) + q2 dzdz¯ (f - ) zz¯ (f - ) = dzdz¯zz¯ + q2 dzdz¯ (f - ) zz¯ (f - ) + 2q dzdz¯f zz¯ (f - ) . (B.8)

Finally combining the Liouville action (B.5), the transformation (B.2) and the Ricci scalar (B.4) we obtain for the term linear in 

dzdz¯ g~ qR~  -4q dzdz¯ (f + Q (f - )) zz¯ = -4q dzdz¯f zz¯ - 4q2 dzdz¯ (f - ) zz¯ .

(B.9)

Combining (B.8) and (B.9) leads to

dzdz¯ 2zz¯ - g~ qR~  2 dzdz¯zz¯

+ 4q dzdz¯f zz¯f + 4q2 dzdz¯ (f - ) zz¯ + 2q2 dzdz¯ (f - ) zz¯ (f - )

= 2 dzdz¯zz¯ + 4q dzdz¯zz¯ + 2q2 dzdz¯ (f - ) zz¯ (f ) + 2q2 dzdz¯ (f - ) zz¯

= 2 dzdz¯zz¯ + 4q dzdz¯zz¯ + 2q2 dzdz¯f zz¯f - 2q2 dzdz¯zz¯

+ 2q2 dzdz¯f zz¯ - 2q2 dzdz¯zz¯f

= dzdz¯ 2zz¯ - g~ qR~ .

(B.10)

In summary, the Liouville action (B.5) is invariant, semiclassically, under the transformation (B.2).

C Fadeev-Popov gauge fixing

We start with the Fubini-Study metric on the two-sphere and its transformation properties under P SL(2, C). We have

gij dxidxj = e2b(z,z¯)g~zz¯dzdz¯ ,

g~zz¯ =

4 (1 + zz¯)2

.

(C.1)

22

Now take f (z) an arbitrary diffeomorphism. The metric then transforms as

ds2 = e2b(f(z),f(z))+log f(z)f(z)g~f(z)f(z)dzdz¯ .

(C.2)

Out of all the diffeomorphisms we consider those normalisable (2.11) on the two-sphere. These are exactly the Moebius transformations

z



f (z)

=

az + b cz + d

,

ad - bc = 1 ,

a, b, c, d  C .

(C.3)

Analogously for f (z). Out of the six real degrees of freedom the maximally compact SO(3) subgroup of P SL(2, C) restricts the parameters a, b, c, d to satisfy

b¯b + dd¯ = 1 , ad¯+ cd¯ = 0 , aa¯ + cc¯ = 1 .

(C.4)

These admit a parametrisation a = cos  ei , c = sin  ei , d = a¯ , b = -c¯ ,

(C.5)

with   (0, 2),   (0, 2), and   (0, /2). Recalling that ad - bc = 1 sets  = 0 such that we are left with three real parameters {, , } which are the Hopf coordinates of the SO(3) group geometry which is the round three-sphere. Infinitesimally, we find

z = -cz2 + (a - d)z + b

(C.6)

and

a = 1 + a , b = 0 + b , c = 0 + c , d = 1 + d .

(C.7)

In particular in order to preserve the condition ad - bc we must additionally impose that a = -d. The latter condition in particular implies that {, , } need to obey the constraints

a = -d = i , b = -c¯ = ei ,  =  = 0 .

(C.8)

The above generate the three infinitesimal SO(3) transformations. To gauge fix the residual P SL(2, C) we are interested in those transformations in P SL(2, C)/SO(3). Since {, , } are real valued (C.8) implies d  R, as well as

b + c = ei - e-i , b - c = ei + e-i .

(C.9)

Additionally we have

b + c = 2i sin  , b - c = 2 cos  ,

(C.10)

23

and consequently the condition P SL(2, C)/SO(3) implies that (b + c)  R and (b - c)  iR. In

summary we have

d  R , (b + c)  R , (b - c)  iR .

(C.11)

We now introduce spherical coordinates

z = ei

z¯

=

 g~zz¯dzdz¯ = d2 + sin2 d2 ,

(C.12)

where   (0, ) and   +2. The Liouville mode expanded in a basis of real spherical harmonics

(A.2) then reads

(z, z¯) = lmYlm(, ) ,
l,m

(C.13)

where we are summing over l  [0, ) and m  [-l, l]. Under a Moebius transformation the transformation of the physical metric (C.2) is then captured by the transformation

(z, z¯) = lmYlm(z, z¯)  lmYlm(f (z), f (z)) + q log

l,m

(C.15)

and f (z)f (z) = (1 - d - cz)(1 - d¯- c¯z¯) = 1 - (d + d¯) - (c z + c¯z¯) ,

(C.16)

where z is given in (C.6). We then find for the argument of the logarithm

have

dG(; ) = 2



2l + 1 l(l + 1) - 2 + 22

= 4G(0; 0) .

l=1

(D.3)

The last equality follows from the fact that G(; ) is  independent. The above sum diverges logarithmically, as expected for coincident fields in two-dimensions. (D.3) holds true also if we remove the l = 1 modes since for each l the spherical harmonics form an irreducible representation of SO(3).

Melonic term. Although position space is useful to assess the nature of the ultraviolet diver-

gences, it is not so useful to evaluate the diagrams. It is convenient to go to momentum space for

this purpose. To do this, we can substitute the expression (D.2) for G(; ) into the first term of

(D.5) to obtain

three different types of diagrams: melons  (D.11), double-tadpoles - (D.13) and cactus di-

agrams

(D.15). Since A0 = -2 the double-tadpoles and the cactus diagrams, which were

responsible for the ultraviolet divergences, exactly cancel. In particular, had the relation between

q and  been different such ultraviolet divergences would appear. We are thus left with
