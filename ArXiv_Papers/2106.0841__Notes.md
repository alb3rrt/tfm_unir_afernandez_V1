## Abstract

We show that for general monotone valuations, there always exists an allocation with transfers that is envy-free and whose Nash social welfare (NSW) is at least an $e^{-1/e}$-fraction of the optimal Nash social welfare. Additionally, when the agents have additive valuations, an envy-free allocation with negligible transfers and whose NSW is within a constant factor of optimal can be found in polynomial time. Consequently, we demonstrate that the seemingly incompatible objectives of fairness and high welfare can be achieved simultaneously via transfer payments, even for general valuations, when the welfare objective is NSW. On the other hand, we show that a similar result is impossible for utilitarian social welfare: any envy-freeable allocation that achieves a constant fraction of the optimal welfare requires non-negligible transfers. To complement this result we present algorithms that compute an envy-free allocation with a given target welfare and with bounded transfers.
