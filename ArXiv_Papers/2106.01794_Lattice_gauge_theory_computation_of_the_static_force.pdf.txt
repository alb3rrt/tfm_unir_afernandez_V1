Abstract We explore a novel approach to compute the force between a static quark and a static antiquark with lattice gauge theory directly. The approach is based on expectation values of Wilson loops or Polyakov loops with chromoelectric field insertions. We discuss theoretical and technical aspects in detail, in particular, how to compensate large discretization errors with a multiplicative renormalization factor and the evaluation using a multilevel algorithm. We also compare numerical results for the static force to corresponding results obtained in the traditional way, i.e., by computing first the static potential and then taking the derivative.

1 Introduction
The static quark-antiquark potential V (r) is one of the best studied quantities in QCD. Very early after QCD was established, it was related to the large time behavior of Wilson loop expectation values [1­4]. Wilson loop expectation values can be computed in lattice QCD. Indeed, they were among the first quantities studied numerically and can nowadays be computed very precisely. At small quark-antiquark separations r the static potential, also referred to as QCD static energy, can also be calculated in a weak coupling expansion. The perturbative expression of the static energy is known quite accurately. The three loop contributions have been computed in Ref. [5, 6]. At three loops the static energy contains also a term proportional to ln s. This term has been computed in Refs. [7, 8] and resummed to all orders at leading logarithmic accuracy in Ref. [9]. Next-to-leading logarithms have been computed and resummed to all orders in Refs. [10, 11]. At present, the static energy is, therefore, known at N3LL (nextto-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic) accuracy.
Combining the high precision results for V (r) from lattice QCD as well as from perturbative QCD allows for an accurate extraction of the strong coupling s, that is competitive with lattice determinations using other observables [12]. Recent extractions of s from V (r) can be found in Refs. [13­18].
The perturbative expression for the static potential computed in dimensional regularization is affected by a renormalon ambiguity of order QCD [19,20]. In a lattice regularization, there is no renormalon ambiguity, but a linear divergence due to the self-energy, which is of order s(1/a)/a, where a denotes the lattice spacing. The self energy vanishes order by order in dimensional regularization. Both the divergent self energy in a lattice regularization and the renormalon in dimensional regularization can be absorbed into an additive r-independent constant. Indeed, the physical information is contained in the shape of V (r), which, after charge renormalization, is finite and renormalon free. The shape of the potential is the static force, defined via F (r) = rV (r). The static force also carries the relevant information to extract s.
A possibility to compute the static force with lattice gauge theory is to first compute the static potential and then to take the derivative via finite differences. This program has been successfully carried out in quenched lattice QCD [21, 22]. In full QCD and at small separations, lattice data points for V (r) are typically sparse and exhibit large discretization errors. One can still determine the static force by interpolating the lattice data points with a smooth function, but the interpolation might become a sizable source of uncertainty [14].
In Refs. [23, 24] it has been recently suggested that the force between a static quark and a static antiquark can be computed directly from the expectation value of a Wilson loop with a chromoelectric field inserted in one of the temporal Wilson lines, a result originally derived in Ref. [25]. In this paper we carry out a quenched lattice QCD study of this quantity. We discuss technical aspects in detail, e.g. how to compute the static force using either Wilson or Polyakov loops with chromoelectric field insertions. We also address the issue of large discretization errors, slow convergence towards the continuum limit and how this can be compensated by a multiplicative renormalization factor. Moreover, we compare the efficiency of this novel method to compute the static force with the traditional method of first computing the static potential and then taking the derivative. Our conclusion is that the determination of the static force from the expectation value of a Wilson loop or a pair of Polaykov loops with a chromoelectric field insertion is a viable alternative method. Both methods provide consistent results with
1

comparable errors, but different systematics.
The paper is organized in the following way. In section 2 we review the derivation of the force in terms of a Wilson loop with a chromoelectric field inserted in one of the temporal lines and we discuss the lattice discretization of this expression and its renormalization. In section 3, we specify our SU(3) lattice setup and we explain, how we use the multilevel algorithm [26] in our computations. Numerical results are presented in section 4. In particular, we compare results obtained with our method to corresponding results obtained by deriving the static potential and we discuss the efficiency of the two methods. In section 5 we draw some conclusions and give a brief outlook. Some details on the optimization of the parameters of the multilevel simulations can be found in appendix A. Preliminary results of this work have been presented at a recent conference [27].

2 Theoretical and technical aspects

2.1 The static force from the static potential

The traditional way to compute the force between a static quark-antiquark pair is to take the numerical derivative of the static potential,

F (r) = rV (r).

(1)

The latter is extracted from a non-perturbative evaluation of rectangular Wilson loops,

Tr{P Wr×T } = Tr P exp ig

dxµ Aµ(x) ,

(2)

r×T

extending in space from 0 to r and in time from -T /2 to +T /2. They represent the correlation function of a static quark at 0 and an antiquark at r connected by a string of color flux. Here and in the following, time and fields are understood as Euclidean, Tr{. . .} denotes the color trace and P implies the path ordering prescription for the color matrices. The spectral decomposition of the Wilson loop expectation value reads

Tr{P Wr×T } = |a0(r)|2e-E0(r)T + |an(r)|2e-En(r)T .

(3)

n>0

The coefficients |an(r)|2 describe the overlap of the spatial Wilson lines with the eigenstates |n(r) of the Hamiltonian of Yang­Mills theory in the presence of two static color charges in temporal gauge with energy En,

H0|n(r) = En(r)|n(r) .

(4)

The color indices, ,  = 1, 2, 3, indicate the transformation of the states in the fundamental and anti-fundamental representations at 0 and r, respectively. The ground state energy is identified with the static potential, V (r)  E0(r), and the excited states with n > 0 have energies En(r) > V (r). Clearly, in the large T limit terms with n > 0 in Eq. (3) are exponentially

2

suppressed with respect to the first one. For sufficiently large T the Wilson loop expectation value, thus, allows to extract V (r) from the first term.
Instead of the Wilson loop, also a correlation function of Polyakov loops can be employed to compute the potential. Defining the Polyakov loop as a normalized trace of a temporal Wilson line closing through the periodic boundary,

the expectation value of its correlation function has the spectral decomposition

(6)

(see, e.g., Ref. [28]), again permitting to extract V (r) for large T from the leading term.

2.2 The static force in terms of the chromoelectric field

An alternative way to compute the static force was proposed in Refs. [23, 24] using the equation

F

(r)

=

r V

(r)

=

lim
T 

-i

Tr{P Wr×T ^r · gE(r, t)} Tr{P Wr×T }

.

(7)

Here ^r is the spatial direction of the separation of the static color charges and E(r, t) denotes the chromoelectric field located on one of the temporal Wilson lines at a time -T /2 < t < +T /2. The chromoelectric field components are defined as Ej(x) = Fj0(x) in terms of the non-Abelian field strength tensor. In the limit T   the right hand side of Eq. (7) is independent of t, as long as t is a fixed time.
The derivation of Eq. (7) follows from Ref. [25]. First, we recall the identities

Dj(r, +T /2)(r, +T /2; r, -T /2) =

+T /2

= (r, +T /2; r, -T /2)Dj(r, -T /2) + i

dt (r, +T /2; r, t) gEj(r, t)(r, t; r, -T /2) (8)

-T /2

Di(r, ±T /2) (r, ±T /2; 0, ±T /2) = (r, ±T /2; 0, ±T /2)i + O±

(9)

(see Refs. [25, 29]), where (y; x) is a straight Wilson line connecting the point x with the point
y, Dj(x) = j - igAj(x) is the gauge covariant derivative computed at the point x, j = /xj and O± are operators involving the chromomagnetic field on the Wilson lines at the times ±T /2 (their explicit expression can be found in Ref. [25]). From this one can derive

+T /2

lim
T 

jTr{P Wr×T }

= lim i
T 

-T /2

dt

Tr{P Wr×T gEj(r, t)} .

(10)

This is because the chromomagnetic fields in the spatial Wilson lines have no overlap with the lowest energy level in the spectrum of the static quark-antiquark pair, hence their contribution is exponentially suppressed in the large T limit. Since in that limit we furthermore have

3

Tr{P Wr×T }  |a0(r)|2e-V (r)T , we can conclude from Eq. (10) that

-jV (r)T

1 + O(1/T )

=

i Tr{P Wr×T }

+T /2
dt Tr{P Wr×T gEj(r, t)} .
-T /2

(11)

The spectral decomposition of the expectation value of a Wilson loop with a chromoelectric field insertion reads

Tr{P Wr×T gEj(r, t)} = |a0(r)|2e-V (r)T 0|gEj |0

+

an(r)am(r)e-(En(r)+Em(r))T /2+(En(r)-Em(r))t n |gEj |m .

(n,m)=(0,0)

(12)

Also in this case, the large T limit selects the ground state contribution [25],

lim
T 

Tr{P Wr×T

gEj(r, t)}

= |a0(r)|2e-V (r)T

0|gEj |0 ,

(13)

but the exponential damping of the remaining terms is weaker than that of the sub-leading terms in Eq. (3), namely e-(En(r)-V (r))T/2 versus e-(En(r)-V (r))T . In the limit T   the expectation
value of the chromoelectric field is translation-invariant in time and its value hence independent of the fixed t (in practice, on the lattice we require t to be sufficiently far from the temporal
boundaries of the Wilson loop). Thus, in the large T limit Eq. (11) reduces to Eq. (7),

jV (r) = -i

Tr{P Wr×T gEj(r, t)} Tr{P Wr×T }

1 + O(1/T ) .

(14)

Eq. (7) provides a way to compute the force directly from a Wilson loop expectation value rather than to compute it by taking a numerical derivative of the static potential V (r). However, the spectral decomposition shows a faster convergence for the ordinary Wilson loop than for the Wilson loop with chromoelectric field insertion and there is also a term just decaying  1/T due to the r-dependence of a0. Thus, it is not clear a priori, which observable is more efficient to evaluate numerically.
Just as in the case of the static potential, the static force may also be extracted from correlation functions of Polyakov loops instead of from Wilson loops. To this end we define a Polyakov loop with a chromoelectric field insertion,

LE (r)

1 Nc

Tr

P exp

ig

T
dt A0(x)
t

^r · gE(r, t)P exp

(15)

The analogue of Eq. (7) then reads

F (r) = lim -i
T 

L (0)LE (r) L(0)L(r)

.

2.3 Renormalization

In the following we assume that QCD, or Yang­Mills theory in our case, has already been renormalized and only discuss what is additionally needed for our specific observable in Eq. (7). It is well known that Wilson loops without insertions renormalize multiplicatively for arbitrary shapes, including cusps or corners [30­32]. For the ordinary rectangular Wilson loop this is easy to understand, as it results from a physical meson correlation function in the heavy quark limit. Meson correlators renormalize multiplicatively, and integrating out heavy quarks merely factorizes a correlator into free heavy quark propagators and the Wilson loop. Similarly, a Wilson loop with a chromoelectric or chromomagnetic field insertion corresponds to a threepoint function. It will then receive an additional renormalization factor associated with the inserted composite operator.
The static force is computed from an eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian and as such it is a renormalization group invariant. In order to see this more clearly, let us evaluate the static force from the static potential extracted from the exponential decay of ordinary Wilson loops,

F (r) = rV (r) ,

lim
T 

Tr{P

Wr×T

}

=

|a0(r)|2e-V

(r)T

.

(17)

The renormalization factors of the Wilson loop are absorbed in the prefactor |a0(r)|2, such that V (r) is defined up to an additive scheme-dependent, but r-independent constant. The latter does not contribute to the derivative and the resulting force can be computed from bare fields.
For the computation of the static force from the chromoelectric field this is not as straightforward to see. Let us denote the renormalization factors for the Wilson loop without and with chromoelectric field insertion as

Tr{P Wr×T } = Z1 Tr{P Wr×T } R

(18)

Tr{P Wr×T gEj(r, t)} = Z2 Tr{P Wr×T gEj(r, t)} R.

(19)

Eq. (10) then implies

jTr{P Wr×T } = Z2 jTr{P Wr×T } R.

(20)

While for the bare fields the derivative commutes with the expectation value, this is not the case for renormalized fields, j Tr{P Wr×T } R = jTr{Wr×T } R. Indeed we have from the previous equations

j

Tr{P Wr×T }

R=

Z2 Z1

jTr{P Wr×T }

R.

(21)

Thus, replacing Eq. (10) with the renormalized expressions and employing again the asymptotic form of the Wilson loop for large T one arrives at the renormalized equation,

jV (r)

=

-i Z2

Tr{P Wr×T gEj(r, t)} Z1 Tr{P Wr×T } R

R,

(22)

which is identical to the bare expression Eq. (14). We conclude that, despite the presence of a chromoelectric field insertion, no divergence or scheme dependence is expected, when the regulator is removed, after an evaluation of the right hand side of Eq. (7).

2.4 Lattice discretization

The Wilson loop Wr×T is discretized by the standard product of adjacent link variables Uµ(x) = eiagAµ(x) around a rectangle with sides of length r and T , where r/a and T /a are integers and a denotes the lattice spacing. In the following we always choose separations r parallel to the z axis. The static potential can then be obtained via

V

a)

Veff(r,

T,

1 a

ln

Tr{P Wr×(T +a)} Tr{P Wr×T }

.

(23)

V (r, a) depends on a with leading order corrections proportional to a2, because the unimproved Wilson pure gauge action we are using in this work is accurate up to O(a2) [33].
For the standard way of computing the static force from the static potential by a discretized derivative,

FV

(r, a)

=

V

(r

+

a, a) - V 2a

(r

(24)

discretization errors are known to be particularly large for small quark-antiquark separations r. A common procedure to reduce these is to define tree-level improved separations

rI = rI (r) =

2a

1/2

4(G(r + a) - G(r - a))

(25)

with

G(r)

and to replace Eq. (24) by

(27)

(see Ref. [34] for details). At tree-level one then obtains

FV

(rI , a)

=

g2 4rI2

,

(28)

in agreement with continuum perturbation theory.
The lattice formulation of the observable given by the right hand side of Eq. (7) is straightforward. We place the field insertion E(r, t) in the numerator at t = 0, such as to maximize the distance to the temporal boundaries of the Wilson loop (which are located at -T /2 and +T /2). The discretization of the field insertion Ej = Fj0 depends on the choice for the discrete partial derivative in the field strength tensor. For the simple forward derivative,

6

jf (x) = (f (x + a) - f (x))/a, the field strength tensor is related to the plaquette Pµ, in the usual way,

Pµ, = 1 + ia2gFµ + O(a3),

(29)

which gives the chromoelectric lattice field components

gEj

=

Pj,0 - Pj,0 2ia2

+ O(a).

(30)

A smaller discretization error can be achieved using the symmetric definition of the derivative, jf (x) = (f (x + a) - f (x - a))/2a, and either a so-called butterfly

j0

=

Pj,0

+ P0,-j 2

or a cloverleaf

j0

=

Pj,0

+ P0,-j

+ P-j,-0 4

+ P-0,j

(31) (32)

of the plaquettes (see e.g. Ref. [35]). For those cases the chromoelectric field is given by

gEj

=

j0 - j0 2ia2

+ O(a2).

(33)

In our computations we use these symmetric discretizations (cloverleaf for Wilson loops, butterfly for Polyakov loops). With these definitions we arrive at the discretized version of Eq. (7),

FE(rI ,

a)

=

lim
T 

FE,eff(rI ,

T,

a)

,

FE,eff(rI , T, a) = -i

Tr{P Wr×T ^r · gE(r, t)} Tr{P Wr×T }

(34)

with r parallel to one of the spatial coordinate axes, and where we use again the tree-level improved separations rI defined in Eq. (25) (one can show that at tree-level FE(rI , a) = g2/4rI2, i.e. also in this case there is agreement with continuum perturbation theory). FE(rI , a) depends on a with leading order corrections proportional to a2 (cf. similar observables discussed in
Refs. [35­37]).

With these choices, both ways to compute the static force have formally discretization errors of O(a2) and we expect

a).

(35)

However, the discretization errors, or equivalently the approach to the continuum, may well be quantitatively quite different for the two observables. This is, because for operators involving elements of the field strength tensor significant finite renormalization factors are expected, when comparing the lattice regularization with regularization schemes in the continuum at values of the gauge coupling typically used in numerical simulations. The reason is the slow convergence of lattice perturbation theory, when expanded in the bare coupling [38]. This has been noted

7

heuristically in early treatments of spin corrections to the static potential [35, 36, 39] and is observed both in a perturbative renormalization of the color-electric field correlator [40] as well as in a non-perturbative renormalization of the color-magnetic field operator [41]. Since Eq. (34) involves a color-electric field, while the standard Wilson loop does not, we expect sizable differences between the two extractions of the static force at finite lattice spacing. To a large extent these differences can, however, be absorbed into a multiplicative finite renormalization factor,

ZE (a)

=

FV (rI, a) FE(rI, a)

,

(36)

where rI is an arbitrary separation, with ZE(a)  1 for a  0. After determining this renormalization factor at a single arbitrary separation rI, it can be applied to improve FE(rI , a) at all other separations,

FEren(rI , a) = ZE(a)FE(rI , a).

(37)

FEren(rI , a) should have significantly smaller discretization errors than FE(rI , a) and, thus, it is expected to be quite close to both FV (rI , a) and F (r) also at values of the gauge coupling typically used in numerical simulations.
All considerations of this section can be applied to correlation functions of Polyakov loops in an analogous way. Particularly important is the counterpart of Eq. (34), which is

FE(rI , a)

3 Lattice setup

3.1 Gauge link ensembles

To discretize SU(3) Yang­Mills theory, we used the standard Wilson plaquette action. For the relation between the lattice spacing a and the gauge coupling  we took the parameterization from Ref. [21],

ln(a/r0) = -1.6804 - 1.7331 ( - 6) + 0.7849 ( - 6)2 - 0.4428 ( - 6)3.

(39)

The parameters of the gauge link ensembles we generated for this work are collected in Table 1. We note that the spatial volumes L3 are quite small with spatial extents L  1.2 fm. Consequently, our results might be subject to sizable finite volume corrections. We do not consider this as a primary problem at this stage, because we were exploring and testing a new method, not trying to determine the static force or any other physical quantity precisely, i.e. for infinite volume.
To improve the ground state overlaps generated by the spatial Wilson lines in the Wilson loops, we used APE smeared spatial links with APE = 0.5 and NAPE = 50 smearing steps (for detailed equations on APE smearing see e.g. Ref. [42]).

3.2 Multilevel algorithm

To compute in a very efficient way the correlation functions introduced in section 2, i.e. Wilson loops and Polyakov loop correlation functions with and without chromoelectric field insertions, we used the multilevel algorithm [26]. We partitioned a lattice with T /a lattice sites in temporal direction into nts time-slices with thicknesses p1, p2, . . . , pnts, where j pj = T /a. For convenience we defined the time-slice partitioning pts = {p1, p2, . . . , pnp}, which was repeated N times to fill the lattice, i.e. pj = pj+np and nts = N np. In principle, time-slices can be partitioned again, but throughout this work we used only a single level of partitioning.
Following a notation similar to that of Ref. [26], correlation functions are written in terms of two-link operators T(x, r^j) = {U0(x)}{U0(x + r^j)}, where U0(x) are link variables in temporal direction and ^j denotes the unit vector in j-direction. In the context of the multilevel algorithm a regular Wilson loop is written as

Wr×T (x) = L(x, r ^j){[P1][P2] . . . [Pnts ]}L(x + T ^0, r^j),

(40)

where L(x, r^j) is an APE smeared spatial Wilson line,

Pk = T(x + (dk - pk)a^0, r^j)T(x + (dk - pk + 1)a^0, r^j) . . . T(x + (dk - 1)a^0, r^j)

(41)

and [Pk] is the average of Pk in the time-slice extending from dk - pk to dk with dk =

k j=1

pj

.

In Eq. (40) and Eq. (41) we have used the multiplication prescription for two-link operators,

{T1T2} = {T1}{T2}.

(42)

As discussed below in more detail, [Pk] corresponds to an average over nm sublattice configurations separated by nu heatbath sweeps, where only links in the interior of the k-th time-slice are updated and spatial links on the time-slice boundaries are fixed. This requires locality, which is
a property of the standard Wilson plaquette action. Wilson loop averages Wr×T are obtained by computing the average of the right hand side of Eq. (40), which contains the time-slice av-
erages [Pk]. Polyakov loop correlation functions can be computed in almost the same way, just replacing Eq. (40) by

L(x)L(x + r^j) = {[P1][P2] . . . [PNts]}.

(43)

When inserting chromoelectric fields using the cloverleaf discretization (32), as done in the case of Wilson loops, one has to choose their positions in such a way that they do not contain interior links of two time-slices. Clearly, this requires times-lices of thickness pj  2. Moreover, for

9

Wilson loops the spatial Wilson lines L should be located on time-slice boundaries. This implies certain restrictions for the temporal extent of the Wilson loop T for given time-slice partitioning. For example with time-slice partitioning pts = {2}, only Wilson loops with temporal extent T /a = 2, 6, 10, . . . can be computed, since the chromoelectric field is always inserted at the center of one of the two temporal Wilson lines. For efficiency reasons one should select a timeslice partitioning, which allows to compute a large number of different temporal extents T . The time-slice partitionings we used for Wilson loops are collected in Table 2. For Polyakov loops such restrictions do not exist and we chose the simple partitioning pts = {T /10a} with chromoelectric fields always inserted at t = a.

Table 2: Time-slice partitionings for the computation of Wilson loops with the multilevel algorithm. Chromoelectric fields are inserted at time-slices marked with .
A multilevel simulation includes the following steps:
(0) Start with any gauge link configuration (we use "hot starts" for our Wilson loop simulations, i.e. randomly chosen gauge links, and "cold starts" for our Polyakov loop simulations, i.e. all gauge links set to unity). Perform nu,th heatbath sweeps to generate a thermalized gauge link configuration, where each sweep is followed by nor overrelaxation steps.
(1) Generate nm sublattice configurations for each of the nts time-slices by updating the links in the interior nmnu times using the a heatbath algorithm (the nm sublattice configurations are then separated by nu updates).
(2) Compute time-slice averages [Pk] on the corresponding nm sublattice configurations.

4 Numerical results
The majority of quantities discussed in the following are lattice quantities and, thus, depend on the lattice spacing a. In contrast to section 2.4, we suppress the a-dependence throughout this section, to keep the notation simple. For example V (r, a) from section 2.4 is equivalent to V (r) in this section. Moreover, we exclusively use tree-level improved separations rI , as discussed in section 2.4. For simplicity we omit the index, i.e. denote separations just by r.

4.1 The static potential

To have a reference, we first computed the static potential V (r) using Eq. (23). For each value r = a, 2a, 3a, . . . we fitted a constant to Veff(r, T ) in the range Tmin  T  Tmax. Tmin and Tmax were chosen sufficiently large using an algorithm discussed in section 5 of Ref. [45]. The fit results represent the static potential V at tree-level improved separations according to appendix B of Ref. [21]. We find agreement with results from the literature [21, 46]. Similarly, we computed the static potential at finite, but small temperature 1/T = 1/Nta  1/4.8 r0  82 MeV from Polyakov loops,

(44)

with the Polyakov loops separated along one of the spatial coordinate axes, e.g. L(r) = L(r =
(0, 0, r)). V (r) obtained via Eq. (44) should be almost identical to V (r) obtained via Eq. (23), because the leading finite temperature correction in L(0)L(r) is suppressed by e-(E1(r)-V (r))T  e-(3/r0)×4.8r0  5×10-7, as can be read off from Eq. (6) (the crude estimate E1(r)-V (r)  3/r0 was taken from Ref. [45]). This is supported by our numerical results as well as by numerical
results from Refs. [47,48]. For spatial separations r/a > 3a and r > 0.13 fm lattice results for V (r)

(see e.g. Ref. [15]). Performing a fit to the lattice results for V (r) obtained with Wilson loops and ensemble B in the range 2.889  r/a  14.012 we find  = 0.260 and  = 1.508/r02, in reasonable agreement with results from the literature, e.g. Ref. [49]. The additive constant V0
is divergent in the continuum limit and physically irrelevant.

4.2 Numerical proof of concept
Now we consider FE(r)/FE(r), where FE is the non-renormalized force defined in Eq. (34), when using Wilson loops. We determined FE(r) by fitting a constant to FE,eff(r), where the T range for the fit was chosen in the same way as for the static potential (see the discussion at the beginning of section 4). When using Polyakov loops, we determine FE(r) by Eq. (38). In both cases r = 0.48 r0  0.24 fm is a fixed separation chosen such that r/a is an integer for all three ensembles, i.e. r/a = 4, 5, 6 for ensemble A, B and C, respectively. Since we compute the static force at improved separations, we take the two data points FE(r1) and FE(r2) with r1 and r2 closest to and enclosing r and interpolate with /r2 +  to read off FE(r). Note that, because of the multiplicative renormalization of FE discussed in section 2.4, FE(r)/FE(r) = FEren(r)/FEren(r). Thus, FE(r)/FE(r) should exhibit only mild discretization errors and is expected to be close to the corresponding continuum result.
In Fig. 1 we show FE(r)/FE(r) as a function of the separation for all three ensembles obtained from Wilson loops as well as from Polyakov loops. For comparison we also show rVCornell(r)/rVCornell(r), which represents the same physical quantity, this time, however, obtained from the lattice result for the static potential parameterized according to Eq. (45) and not from a direct computation of the static force. The agreement of FE(r)/FE(r) and rVCornell(r)/rVCornell(r) is a numerical proof of concept for our method of computing the static force.

4.3 The renormalization constant ZE
In Fig. 2 we show the renormalization constant ZE = FV (r)/FE(r), defined in Eq. (36), as a function of r, both for Wilson loops (left plot) and for Polyakov loops (right plot). As discussed in section 2.4, ZE should be fairly independent of r. This expected constant behavior of ZE is confirmed by our numerical results, which exhibit clear plateaus. There is, however, a dependence on  and, thus, on the lattice spacing a, where ZE is slowly decreasing for decreasing a. This is consistent with our expectation ZE(a)  1 for a  0 discussed in section 2.4.
We determined numerical values for ZE separately for Wilson loops and for Polyakov loops and for each of our three ensembles by fitting a constant to the lattice data points shown in Fig. 2 in the range 0.35 r0  r  0.65 r0. The fit results are collected in Table 4.

4.4 Comparison of efficiency: FV versus FE

4.4.1 Asymptotic T behavior of Wilson loops

The spectral decomposition of Wilson loops and of Wilson loops with chromoelectric field insertions has been discussed in section 2.1 and section 2.2. For large T the Wilson loop Tr{P Wr×T } is proportional to e-V (r)T with leading order correction suppressed by e-(E1(r)-V (r))T (see Eq. (3)). In contrast to that the Wilson loop with chromoelectric field insertion Tr{P Wr×T gEj} has a leading order correction proportional to e-(E1(r)-V (r))T/2 (see Eq. (12)), i.e. a correction much weaker suppressed with respect to the temporal separation T . Moreover, in FE,eff(r, T ) there is also a term just decaying  1/T due to the r-dependence of a0 (see Eqs. (11) and (14)). Thus, to determine the static force using FE, we expect that one has to consider correlation functions at T values at least twice as large compared to using FV , to get a similar suppression of unwanted contributions by excited states.
In Fig. 3 we compare the asymptotic T behavior of the renormalized effective force

for spatial separation r/a = 5 and ensemble C. FEre,neff(r, T ) converges to a plateau only at T /a > 14. FV,eff(r, T ), on the other hand, is essentially constant already for T /a > 6, which is consistent with our theoretical expectation.

For Polyakov loops there is no such difference between the two methods. In both cases contributions by excited states are proportional to e-(E1(r)-V (r))T , where T denotes the temporal extent of the lattice.

4.4.2 Statistical precision and computing time
Now we compare the efficiency of different approaches to compute the static force. A useful quantity to assess the efficiency is (O)2 , the computing time  needed to compute an observable O with statistical error O. Small values indicate an efficient method, large values an
14

inefficient method. Since statistical errors in Monte Carlo simulations are proportional to 1/ , this quantity allows a simple and fair comparison of two methods, even if the times invested for the corresponding computations are different.
We start by exploring the benefit of using the multilevel algorithm for the case of Wilson loops. To this end we compare in Fig. 4 a computation, where we employed the multilevel algorithm with optimized parameters, as discussed in appendix A, to a standard heatbath simulation without multilevel algorithm using the ratio (O)2 |multilevel/(O)2 |no multilevel. The observable investigated in the left plot is the effective force, i.e. O = FE,eff(r, T ), for several fixed separations r. The observable investigated in the right plot is the effective potential, i.e. O = Veff(r, T ), for the same fixed separations r. Both plots show that at small temporal separations T it is even more expensive to use the multilevel algorithm. However, at large temporal separations, which are typically needed for a precise extraction of the static force or the static potential, there is a huge gain in efficiency, when employing the multilevel algorithm. For example for ensemble C and T /a = 14 the time needed to compute the static force with the same statistical precision is reduced by a factor of around 104 almost independent of r. As one can read off from Fig. 3, it is necessary to compute the correlation functions at such temporal separations.

In Fig. 5 we compare the efficiency of computing the static force, when using FE and when using FV . Again we show ratios of the quantity (O)2 . The left plot shows the result for Wilson loops, where O = FEre,neff(r, T ) in the numerator and O = FV,eff(r, T /2) in the denominator (note that roughly twice as large temporal separations T are needed for FEre,neff compared to FV,eff for a similar suppression of contributions by excited states; see section 4.4.1). The right plot shows the result for Polyakov loops, where O = FEren(r) in the numerator and O = FV (r) in the denominator. The plots indicate that it is advantageous to compute the static force via FE, when using Wilson loops and typical temporal and spatial separations, while for Polyakov loops the traditional method via FV is significantly more efficient. This different behavior is somewhat surprising and should be investigated in more detail in the future.

5 Conclusions
We tested a novel method to compute the static force F (r) from expectation values of Wilson or Polyakov loops with chromoelectric field insertions, which was suggested in Refs. [23, 24]. The numerical results exhibit sizable discretization errors and the convergence to the continuum limit is rather slow, but this can be compensated by an r-independent multiplicative renormalization factor ZE. Concerning efficiency, our method appears to be comparable to the traditional method of first computing the static potential and then taking the derivative. For Wilson loops we even found a slight advantage, while for Polyakov loops our method seems to be somewhat less efficient. In this exploratory study we used pure SU(3) gauge theory, lattices with rather small spatial volume and the multilevel algorithm. In the future it will be interesting to study the applicability and efficiency of our method on full QCD gauge link ensembles with larger spatial volume, where the multilevel algorithm is not available.
This explorative computation of the static force also constitutes an important preparatory step for future projects, where similar correlation functions (Wilson or Polyakov loops with chromoelectric or chromomagnetic field insertions) need to be computed. An example is the computation of 1/m and 1/m2 corrections (m denotes the heavy quark mass) to the ordinary static potential, as obtained in potential Non-Relativistic QCD in Refs. [25, 50, 51] (see also Refs. [29, 52]) and evaluated on the lattice in Refs. [35, 37, 39, 53], or to hybrid static potentials, as theoretically worked out and suggested in Refs. [54­56].

A Optimization of multilevel parameters
To crudely optimize the multilevel parameters for our Wilson loop computations on ensemble A, we first compared several time-slice partitionings pts for fixed nm = 100 and nu = 1. Fig. 6 (top plot) indicates that thinner time-slices are more efficient. Thus, we decided for time-slice partitionings pts, where the majority of time-slices have thinkness pj = 1 (see Table 2). In a second step we investigated, how efficiency is related to the parameter nu, the number of heatbath updates between two successive sublattice configurations. For fixed nm = 100 we find nu = 2 as optimum (see Fig. 6, bottom left plot). Finally, we investigated, how efficiency is related to the parameter nm, the number of sublattice configurations used to compute time-slice averages [Pk]. For fixed nu = 2 we identify nm = 50 as a rather efficient choice (see Fig. 6, bottom right plot). Similar optimizations were carried out for ensembles B and C and for the Polyakov loop computations.
