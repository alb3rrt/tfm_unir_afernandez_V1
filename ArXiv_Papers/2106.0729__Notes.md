## Abstract

We study the propagation of wavepackets along weakly curved interfaces between topologically distinct media. Our Hamiltonian is an adiabatic modulation of Dirac operators omnipresent in the topological insulators literature. Using explicit formulas for straight edges, we construct a family of solutions that propagates, for long times, unidirectionally and dispersion-free along the curved edge. We illustrate our results through various numerical simulations.
